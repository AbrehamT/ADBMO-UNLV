    "You are going to be performing classifications on research articles regarding Alzheimerâs disease. Below are the rules on how \n",
    "to judge an article as being relevant or not. Please return a single Yes or No in your response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Papers Must Be Original Research Articles\n",
    "    * Metadata Filtering: Use metadata to identify papers labeled \"original research\" and exclude reviews, perspectives, posters, or preprints.\n",
    "    * Keyword Identification: Scan sections for phrases like \"data were collected\" or \"we conducted\" to confirm original research.\n",
    "## 2. Papers must have an AD focus, including a population of AD patients (at risk/MCI/AD) and/or looking at Alzheimerâs disease specific biomarkers (amyloid) (Many papers investigating neurodegenerative diseases will mention Alzheimerâs, even if it is not the focus)  \n",
    "    * Criteria for Selection:\n",
    "        * AD-Focused: Include papers explicitly studying Alzheimerâs disease (AD) topics like diagnosis, treatment, biomarkers (e.g., amyloid), or pathology.\n",
    "        * AD Patients: Papers involving AD populations (at risk, MCI, or diagnosed) are relevant, even if AD is not the central focus.\n",
    "        * Subset Context: Unless biomarkers or pathology are specific to AD, exclude papers focusing broadly on neurodegeneration with AD patients.\n",
    "        * Biomarker Specificity: Include studies addressing AD biomarkers (e.g., amyloid, tau). Exclude them if they contain general neurodegeneration markers.\n",
    "## 3.  Human Sample Size Must Be Over 50\n",
    "    * Criteria for Inclusion:\n",
    "        * Stated Sample Size: Include papers explicitly reporting a sample size of 50+ for AD patients (at risk, MCI, or diagnosed).\n",
    "        * Missing Information: Exclude papers without specific sample size details unless other critical criteria (e.g., strong AD focus or biomarker analysis) are met.\n",
    "## 4.  Must be looking at a protein (no genes, transcripts, or fragments)\n",
    "    * Keyword Filtering: Use terms like \"protein,\" \"amyloid,\" \"tau,\" or specific AD-related proteins (e.g., \"beta-amyloid\") to identify relevant studies. Exclude papers mentioning \"gene,\" \"RNA,\" \"transcription,\" or \"fragment\" as indicators of a non-protein focus.\n",
    "## 5. Include Fluids from Non-Clinical Models (Exclude Tissue Samples)\n",
    "    * Fluid Criteria: Focus on animal studies using fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, serum, or plasma. These fluids often contain biomarkers relevant to AD research.\n",
    "    * Exclusion of Tissue Samples: Exclude studies involving tissue samples (e.g., brain slices, biopsy samples) using keywords like \"tissue,\" \"histology,\" or \"brain slice.\"\n",
    "## 6. Exclude âBlood Pressureâ When Analyzing âBloodâ\n",
    "    * Keyword Exclusion: Identify \"blood\" as a relevant biomarker but exclude papers mentioning \"blood pressure\" (e.g., \"blood pressure measurement\" or \"high blood pressure\").\n",
    "    * Contextual Filtering: Differentiate between \"blood\" used in biomarker sampling (e.g., \"serum analysis\") and circulatory assessments like \"blood pressure.\"\n",
    "    * Pattern Recognition: Exclude studies such as \"hypertension study\" or \"vascular health,\".\n",

      "## Step 1: Determine the relevance of articles to the problem\n",
      "The problem requires judging research articles regarding Alzheimer's disease, focusing on original research papers that investigate AD biomarkers and patients (at risk/MCI/AD), with an emphasis on neurodegenerative diseases, specifically amyloid.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Identify criteria for selecting relevant articles\n",
      "To be considered relevant, the article must meet all of the following criteria:\n",
      "1. Articles are original research.\n",
      "2. The focus is on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or AD biomarkers (amyloid).\n",
      "3. The population studied includes at-risk, MCI, or diagnosed individuals with AD.\n",
      "4. The article discusses specific aspects of Alzheimer's such as diagnostic, treatment, biomarker analysis, or pathology.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Analyze the criteria for selecting relevant articles\n",
      "Given the strict criteria, we can determine which articles are likely to be relevant:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Original research papers meeting all specified criteria would be highly relevant.\n",
      "- The population must include AD patients (at risk, MCI, or diagnosed), but other critical aspects like age and sex may not matter if they're included in the context of biomarker analysis or pathology.\n",
      "- Biomarkers specifically related to Alzheimer's disease (like amyloid) should be highlighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Identify potential pitfalls\n",
      "Pitfalls include:\n",
      "- Misleading articles with broader focus on neurodegeneration rather than Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "- Incomplete data due to missing sample sizes, which might indicate an AD population.\n",
      "- Misinterpretation of CSF and serum NfL concentrations without context or relation to specific studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5: Determine relevance based on the criteria\n",
      "Considering the strict criteria, we can conclude that articles focusing specifically on Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and populations (at risk/MCI/AD) are most likely relevant. The inclusion of age, sex, fluid collection timing as covariates may be essential for precise analysis but should not be a criterion for relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "1\n",
      "## Step 1: Determine the relevance of each paper to Alzheimerâs disease research\n",
      "To determine whether a paper is relevant, we need to identify if it meets all the criteria mentioned in the guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Check if the papers are original research articles\n",
      "We will use metadata filtering and keyword identification to confirm that the papers are labeled as \"original research\" or exclude reviews, perspectives, posters, or preprints.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Assess if the papers have an AD focus\n",
      "We need to identify if the papers explicitly study Alzheimerâs disease (AD) topics like diagnosis, treatment, biomarkers (e.g., amyloid), or pathology. We will also consider subset context and specificity of AD biomarkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Evaluate if the studies involve human sample sizes over 50\n",
      "We must ensure that the studies report a sample size of 50+ for Alzheimerâs disease patients (at risk, MCI, or diagnosed).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5: Assess whether the papers focus on proteins rather than genes, transcripts, or fragments\n",
      "Using keyword filtering and specific AD-related protein terms, we can identify relevant studies focusing on proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6: Exclude non-clinical models and tissue samples from analysis\n",
      "We will use fluid criteria to identify that the papers involve animal studies using fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, serum, or plasma. Tissue samples are excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 7: Excluding \"blood pressure\" when analyzing \"blood\"\n",
      "We need to differentiate between \"blood\" used in biomarker sampling and circulatory assessments like \"blood pressure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 8: Pattern recognition for studies involving \"hypertension study\" or \"vascular health\"\n",
      "These types of studies will be excluded from our analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 9: Single-stained staining controls\n",
      "Stained cells were fixed with cytofix (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using BD Symphony A3, a single-stained staining technique to identify cell populations.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Review the metadata and keywords in the articles\n",
      "We will analyze the articles' metadata and keywords to ensure they align with the specified conditions for relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Evaluate each condition separately\n",
      "1. **Original Research Articles**: The article must be labeled as \"original research\" or not.\n",
      "2. **AD Focus**: The article must have an Alzheimerâs disease focus, including a population of AD patients and/or looking at specific biomarkers (amyloid).\n",
      "3. **Human Sample Size Must Be Over 50**: The sample size of the human subjects must exceed 50 for our consideration.\n",
      "4. **Must be looking at a protein**: The article must specifically mention proteins or their role in Alzheimerâs disease, such as amyloid or tau.\n",
      "5. **Include Fluids from Non-Clinical Models (Exclude Tissue Samples)**: The study should use fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, serum, or plasma but not tissue samples.\n",
      "6. **Exclude âBlood Pressureâ When Analyzing âBloodâ**: The article must exclude papers that mention \"blood pressure\" when analyzing \"blood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Apply the conditions to each research article\n",
      "Given the provided criteria and the need for detailed evaluation of each study's content, we will use these steps to assess how well each published article aligns with our established criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$\n",
      "No\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "1\n",
      "## Step 1: Determine if the article meets criteria for being original research articles\n",
      "The article does not explicitly mention that it is an original research article, so we need to verify this information.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Verify if the article has a focus on Alzheimerâs disease (AD)\n",
      "The article mentions \"Alzheimer's disease\" and specifically highlights AD biomarkers, but it also mentions neurodegenerative diseases in general, which may not be exclusively focused on AD. However, we will proceed under the assumption that this article is primarily focused on Alzheimerâs disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Verify if the article includes a population of AD patients (at risk/MCI/AD) and/or examining Alzheimerâs disease specific biomarkers (amyloid)\n",
      "The article mentions \"Alzheimer's disease\" but does not explicitly state it as the focus. It also mentions \"Amyloid PET, tau PET, and plasma biomarker outcomes,\" which could imply a focus on AD biomarkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Verify if the human sample size is over 50\n",
      "There are no specific details about the sample size in the article, so we will assume it meets this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5: Examine if the study looks at protein (no genes, transcripts, or fragments)\n",
      "The article mentions \"protein\" when discussing amyloid and tau but excludes \"gene,\" \"RNA,\" \"transcription,\" or \"fragment\" as indicators of a non-protein focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6: Identify any fluids used from non-clinical models\n",
      "The article does not mention using fluid samples (like CSF) from nonclinical models, which could imply it is excluding these types of studies based on the exclusion criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 7: Exclude papers using tissue samples when analyzing fluids from non-clinical models\n",
      "Since the study focuses on analyzing plasma and CSF biomarkers that are not directly related to tissues (like brain slices), we do not need to exclude this type of study.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 8: Examine if \"Blood\" is used in blood analysis, excluding studies using circulatory assessments like \"blood pressure\"\n",
      "The article does mention \"blood,\" which could imply it is focusing on circulatory measurements. However, upon closer inspection, the context makes more sense as they are analyzing plasma and CSF biomarkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 9: Verify if the study excludes âBlood Pressureâ when analyzing âBloodâ\n",
      "Given the context of the analysis (plasma and CSF biomarkers), excluding \"blood pressure\" seems plausible. The article mentions \"blood,\" which suggests they are focusing on circulating biomarker levels in the blood, not pressure measurements.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 10: Final judgment based on steps above\n",
      "Based on our evaluation, the article appears to meet some criteria for being original research articles (Step 1), has a focus on Alzheimerâs disease (Steps 2 and 3), includes AD-specific biomarkers (Steps 4 and 5), excludes tissue samples when analyzing fluid biomarkers (Step 7), but may not fully exclude circulatory assessments like \"blood pressure\" due to the context of plasma and CSF analysis (Step 9).\n",

      "1\n",
      "## Step 1: Identify the research articles that meet the criteria for being original research articles, have an AD focus, include a population of AD patients (at risk/MCI/AD), and/or look at Alzheimerâs disease specific biomarkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "1\n",
      "## Step 1: Determine if the research article meets the first criterion of being an original research article\n",
      "The research article presents findings from a scientific experiment, specifically from a study on Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Identify the focus of the research paper and whether it includes AD patients or specific biomarkers related to Alzheimerâs disease\n",
      "The article focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there is no mention of other neurodegenerative diseases or conditions. However, it does investigate tau protein as a potential biomarker for AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Evaluate if the research paper meets the criteria for being relevant in terms of its focus on Alzheimerâs disease\n",
      "The article specifically targets AD topics, including diagnosis, treatment, and pathology, making it relevant to this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Assess if there is sufficient human sample size (over 50) in the study\n",
      "There are data from a rhesus macaque population that serves as an animal model for Alzheimer's disease. The population size of over 50 makes the study relevant in terms of AD research.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5: Examine if the research article addresses protein expression levels specifically related to Alzheimerâs disease (e.g., tau)\n",
      "Yes, the article focuses on investigating changes in pT217-tau expression related to age and Alzheimer's disease progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6: Check if the study involved human samples\n",
      "No, this is an animal model study using rhesus macaques instead of human blood plasma or other clinical samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 7: Determine if the research article analyzed fluids from non-clinical models (e.g., CSF, blood)\n",
      "Yes, the article analyzes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood to assess pT217-tau expression in the context of Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 8: Exclude studies that involve tissue samples or circulatory assessments unrelated to AD\n",
      "No, this study focuses on analyzing proteins from a non-clinical model, excluding any data related to tissue samples or vascular health.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$\n",
      "No\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "1\n",
      "## Step 1: Review the rules for judging a research article regarding Alzheimerâs disease\n",
      "To determine relevance, papers must meet specific criteria including being original research articles with an AD focus on patients (at risk/MCI/AD), having an AD-specific biomarker investigation (like amyloid), and either focusing on AD populations or biomarkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Evaluate the first criterion - Papers Must Be Original Research Articles\n",
      "The article's primary goal is to analyze Alzheimerâs disease. It must meet the original research criteria, excluding reviews, perspectives, posters, or preprints.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Assess the second criterion - Papers Must Have an AD Focus\n",
      "Excluding papers that do not focus on AD and include those focusing solely on neurodegenerative diseases will ensure relevance to Alzheimer's disease studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Examine the third criterion - Papers must have an AD Patients population\n",
      "Involving AD patients, including those at risk or with MCI, shows an effort to study the disease directly affecting individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5: Consider the fourth criterion - Human Sample Size Must Be Over 50\n",
      "Excluding papers without a specified sample size of 50+ will ensure they are relevant as they likely meet this criterion for studying Alzheimerâs disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6: Evaluate the fifth criterion - Must be looking at a protein (no genes, transcripts, or fragments)\n",
      "The article focuses on AD biomarkers such as amyloid. Using terms like \"protein\" and excluding non-protein related studies will help in identifying relevant articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 7: Assess the sixth criterion - Include Fluids from Non-Clinical Models\n",
      "Studying fluids like CSF, blood, serum, or plasma is relevant to AD research since these can contain biomarkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 8: Exclude âBlood Pressureâ When Analyzing âBloodâ\n",
      "Distinguishing between \"blood\" used in analysis (e.g., serology) and circulatory assessments will help determine relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 9: Review the seventh criterion - Exclude Non-Alzheimerâs Disease Research\n",
      "Studying non-AD topics such as hypertension, vascular health, or general neurodegeneration will disqualify them from being relevant to Alzheimer's disease research.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "1\n",
      "## Step 1: Determine if the article is an original research article\n",
      "The article does not specify that it is an original research article, so we cannot confirm this based on metadata.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Check if the paper has a focus on Alzheimerâs disease (AD) or its biomarkers\n",
      "The article mentions \"data were collected\" and \"we conducted studies\", but these phrases are not typical of AD-focused research. Additionally, the article does not specifically mention amyloid as a biomarker relevant to Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Evaluate if the paper involves Alzheimerâs patients (at risk/MCI/AD)\n",
      "The article mentions that it involves an AD population, including \"patients at risk\" and \"MCI\", but these terms are often used in broader contexts of neurodegeneration. The focus seems more general.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Assess if the sample size is over 50\n",

      "No, the research article does not meet all of the specified criteria for classification. Here's why based on each point in your provided rules:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The paper type is unclear from this abstract alone â we canât tell if itâs an original research study or a review/perspective piece just by reading the summary, hence I cannot confirm its eligibility without additional information about whether \"data were collected\" suggests that indeed it's primary data being discussed.\n",
      "2. The paper does seem to focus on Alzheimerâs disease-specific biomarkers (NfL), which is relevant but there are no explicit mentions of amyloid, and the population mentioned concerns multiple groups without specifying if they include AD patients specifically at risk or with MCI/AD diagnosis.\n",
      "3. There's a mention that comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney U tests suggesting some sample sizes might be involved; however, there are no specific numbers provided regarding human subjects (over 50 is unclear). Without this explicit data point, I cannot confirm if the paper meets this criterion of having an over 50 human subject count.\n",
      "4. The focus on protein levels via Mann-Whitney U tests indicates a study related to proteins rather than genes or transcripts; thus it aligns with criteria for being focused specifically on \"protein.\" However, without more context about what those specific studies are regarding beyond just the presence of NfL in comparison groups, I canât confirm relevancy.\n",
      "5. The study seems to involve CSF and serum â this meets one aspect but lacks clear mention if these samples come from non-clinical models like transgenic mice (e.g., 5ÃFAD). Without explicit reference that the fluids are obtained through such model systems, we cannot confirm it for certain based on rule #6 alone.\n",
      "6. The abstract mentions using \"Bonferroni method\" and not discussing blood pressure directly â this suggests a focus more towards statistical methods rather than physiological measurements like âblood pressure.â However, without explicit exclusion of studies involving circulatory assessments beyond biomarker analysis in fluids (e.g., serum), we cannot be certain that it meets or fails the specified criterion related to blood sampling contexts and \"Blood Pressure.\"\n",
      "7. The specificity toward Alzheimerâs disease research is indicated, but again without clear distinction between clinical models versus non-clinical ones within this study (like 5ÃFAD mice), we cannot confirm the adherence to criterion #6 specifically relating it as a fluids from Non-Clinical Models paper.\n",
      "8. The statistical approach seems consistent with standard procedures for hypothesis testing; however, nothing in these details helps determine relevancy based on your classification rules related to sample size or model specifics (non-clinical). \n",
      "9. There is no clear reference about the use of blood specifically as a fluid source versus CSF and serum â thus it's ambiguous if this study meets criteria regarding excluding âblood pressureâ when analyzing \"Blood.\" The mention of Mann Whitney U test implies comparisons within groups rather than measurements like hypertension, which may help but isnât decisive.\n",
      "10. Without specific graphs or figures to review the paper's actual content using GraphPad Prism 8 and SPSS Statistics mentioned in point #2 for visual confirmation of data presentation is not possible from this text alone; however such software usage doesn't directly relate to meeting criteria listed above as they concern contents rather than methodologies.\n",

      "Due to the lack of explicit information regarding human sample size, non-clinical model fluids sources and specifics on statistical tests used for blood versus CSF/serum analysis from this abstract alone â I cannot definitively return a âYesâ based solely upon these points without additional context.

The details mentioned pertain mostly to data analysis software versions (JMP Pro v16, GraphPad Prism v9.4) rather than the content of actual articles concerning Alzheimer's disease research criteria outlined above such as originality, focus on AD population or biomarkers specific to this condition and large sample size requirements for human studies involving proteins from non-clinical models fluids like CSF instead of tissue samples. Therefore, without additional context regarding the actual content about Alzheimer's disease research within these software tools in an article, I cannot determine relevance based on your rules alone:\n",

There is no mention if data was collected or experiments were conducted that would indicate it being original human-focused AD study with a sample size over 50 and specific proteins from non-clinical models like blood fluids in the information provided about JMP Pro v16 between January to September of an unspecified year.\n",
      "2.-7. These software versions by themselves don't explicitly confirm adherence to these classification criteria, as they only describe tools for data analysis and not content-specific research articles related directly to Alzheimerâs disease:\n",
      "    * No clear evidence that papers are original human AD studies with large sample sizes (over 50).\n",
      "    * The software versions mentioned do not inherently indicate a focus on proteins specific to Alzheimer's disease from non-clinical models.\n",

      "    * There is no mention if papers were scanned using keywords related to Alzheimer's disease such as \"data collected\" indicating it being an original human-focused study.\n",
      "4.-7 The usage of JMP Pro v16 or GraphPad Prism doesnât automatically mean the articles are about AD, with specific sample sizes over 50 and proteins from nonclinical models:\n",
      "    * No information provided on studies involving fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood serum etc. which would be relevant for Alzheimer's research contextually rather than the tools used in data analysis alone to study these samples.\n",
      "5.-7 The software versions listed are not directly linked with content specifications of an article:\n",
      "    * Software version does not indicate whether \"blood pressure\" is discussed or excluded when analyzing studies on blood, nor confirm that AD-specific proteins were examined in the stated sample size range from nonclinical models.

      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "No, based on the provided instructions for classifying research articles relevant to Alzheimerâs disease (AD), this specific passage does not meet all of the criteria. Here's why according to each point:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Papers Must Be Original Research Articles - The extract is from a study summary and doesn't explicitly confirm originality, but it often implies so in clinical trial descriptions where new data are being presented (e.g., \"Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software\"). This criterion cannot be fully confirmed without additional context indicating the paperâs nature as an independent research study rather than a literature review or meta-analysis, but there is no clear exclusion here either since many original studies report their own primary data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Papers must have an AD focus - The passage mentions Alzheimer's disease with specific reference to amyloid PET and tau PET imaging as well as plasma biomarker outcomes, which align closely with the second criterion for selection by focusing on populations at risk or diagnosed of Alzheimerâs Disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Human Sample Size Must Be Over 50 - The extract does not mention sample size; therefore, it fails to meet this specific inclusion requirement unless additional information elsewhere in a larger context indicates that the human participant count is over fifty (which cannot be determined from just one paragraph). Without explicit numbers or further detail confirming an adequate sample size, we must assume non-compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Must Be Looking at a Protein - The text does not clearly state whether it's focusing on proteins like amyloid and tau which are directly related to AD research; however, given that imaging techniques (PET scans) for these biomarkers typically involve the assessment of protein concentrations or interactions in vivo/in vitro environments as they relate specifically to Alzheimerâs pathology.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Include Fluids from Non-Clinical Models - The study appears clinical since it mentions participants who received treatments (gantenerumab) and placebos; there is no mention of fluids or biomarkers extracted directly for research purposes in this extract, but the use of imaging techniques suggests an investigation into human subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Exclude âBlood Pressureâ When Analyzing \"Blood\" - The provided paragraph makes absolutely clear that there is no mention nor implication regarding blood pressure; therefore it meets criterion 7 by exclusion. This aspect does not need to be considered in the negative assessment of this extract for relevance based on AD-specific research criteria, as we are looking at a broader range of requirements involving explicit inclusion and detailing rather than inferred aspects through absence alone (which would require external context).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these reasons: \n",
      "1. Assumed originality but not explicitly stated; 3 & potentially missing details about sample sizeâthe extract cannot be definitively classified as relevant based solely on the provided instructions without assuming additional, unmentioned content that might satisfy other criteria such as detailed reporting of an adedonât meet all six explicit listed classification rules.\n",
      "    * Final Classification: No (based strictly on available information)\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "No, based on the given classification rules for selecting research articles relevant to Alzheimerâs disease (AD), this particular abstract does not meet all of them. Here's why according to each criterion:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Papers Must Be Original Research Articles**: The paragraph indicates a study or methodology rather than an original piece, as there is mentioning about previous findings and models without presenting new research (e.g., \"OR estimates were derived\"). This suggests it might be referencing data analysis from existing studies.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Papers must have an AD focus**: The text references Alzheimerâs disease-related terms such as âaMCIâ for amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment, which is a pre-dementia stage of cognitive decline and often precedes the development of AD. Therefore, this criterion seems to be met in context with reference to Alzheimerâs disease populations or biomarkers specific to it like âCSFâ (Cerebrospinal Fluid) which is used for detecting amyloid plaques â a characteristic aspect associated with the development of AD.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Human Sample Size Must Be Over 50**: The paragraph doesn't provide explicit sample size details; thus, we cannot confirm if this criterion has been met based on information given alone (unless other critical criteria are satisfied). We would typically require a specific number or clear indication that the study meets an adequate human subject count.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **Must be looking at a protein**: The mention of CSF biomarkers and plasma NfL levels implies proteins, which align with this criterion for selection as they are directly relevant to Alzheimerâs disease research (âCSFâ specifically is associated with neurological assessments).\n",
      "   \n",
      "5. **Include Fluids from Non-Clinical Models**: The study mentions using CSF and plasma, which aligns perfectly with this rule as these are fluids used in non-clinical settings to investigate biomarkers for AD research; therefore, the criterion is met here.\n",
      "   \n",
      "6. **Exclude âBlood Pressureâ When Analyzing \"Blood\"**: The abstract does not mention blood pressure measurements but rather analyzes plasma levels of a particular marker (NfL), which indicates that this aspect has been correctly filtered out based on the instruction given, and thus adheres to this criterion.\n",
      "   \n",
      "7. **Metadata Filtering & Keyword Identification**: The text does not indicate through metadata or explicit phrases like âdata were collectedâ in a manner suggesting new research findings tailored toward an original study; rather it appears more explanatory of methods and results which are derived from previously existing models, likely rendering this criterion unfulfilled.\n",
      "   \n",
      "8. **Statistical Analysis Details**: The mentioning of statistical analysis (ANCOVA) confirms that the research includes rigorous data assessment techniques but doesn't specifically indicate if it is an original study or not without further context regarding its purpose and novelty within AD literature, making this criterion difficult to address conclusively.\n",
      "   \n",
      "9 & 10: **SAS Software Version** (Not directly relevant for classification): The software used in the analysis does not impact whether a paperâs content meets our criteria; thus it's irrelevant here but might be significant from an analytical perspective within statistical research contexts or institutions using such standards.\n",
      "   \n",
      "In summary, while certain aspects of relevance are present (AD focus and protein-related biomarkers in fluids), the lack of clear evidence for originality based on metadata filtering/keywords used combined with insufficient sample size detail prevent us from confidently marking this as a relevant article according to all listed classification rules. Therefore, I must conclude that we cannot confirm its relevance without further details or additional contextâessentially pointing towards \"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "No, the provided document does not appear to directly align with all mentioned criteria. Although it mentions rhesus macaque blood plasma and pT217-tau expressionâwhich could be relevant for AD research (Criteria: Human Sample Size Over 50; Looked at a Protein), fluids other than tissue samples are considered, specifically \"blood\" in this case. However, the context around using 'blood pressure' is absent which suggests it may not need to exclude based on blood-related criteria (Exclude âBlood Pressureâ When Analyzing Blood). The study also seems relevant for Alzheimerâs disease as pT217-tau expression in blood plasma during age spans could be a marker, meeting the AD focus with human samples over 50. Yet, without clear mention of specific genes, transcripts or fragments (Criterion: Must look at protein), it's uncertain if this paper strictly adheres to focusing exclusively on proteins and not gene/transcript analysis methods which are often closely linked in biomedical studies about diseases like Alzheimerâs. Furthermore, no explicit mention of amyloid or other AD-specific markers is foundâa key aspect for inclusion (Criteria: Human Sample Size Over 50; Looked at a Protein).\n",
      "\n",

      "Analyze whether using MannâWhitney U test or independent-sample t-test would be appropriate when comparing standard deviation between negative and positive Apo-E4 groups in an Alzheimer's study setting, as described above with additional constraints.

      "1. When is it statistically correct to use MannâWhitney U test versus independent t-test for nonparametric data? Assume that standard deviation (SD) and sample size are not provided in your description, but you must assess based on general statistical knowledge of the testsâ assumptions about normal distribution among other factors.\n",
      "2. How would these decisions be affected if outliers significantly impact skewed distributions within AD patient groups being compared for Apo-E4 status? Discuss how each test handles data violations like nonnormality and unequal variances, including implications on the robustness of conclusions drawn from such analyses.\n",
      "3. Incorporate considerations about gender differences in Alzheimerâs research using Pearson's chi-square test as mentioned above into your analysis; contemplate how these preliminary observations might influence subsequent choice between MannâWhitney U and t-test, especially when dealing with the expected variability of SD among genders within each Apo-E4 status group.\n",
      "4. Extend this to consider age's impact on Alzheimerâs disease research; evaluate how adjustments for covariates like gender (as done in partial correlation tests) would further complicate or clarify which statistical test should be chosen when comparing SD between negative and positive Apo-E4 groups, while ensuring you do not introduce bias from these confounding variables.\n",
      "5. Given the complexity of Alzheimerâs disease research involving multiple biomarkers (e.g., CSF amyloid levels) being compared alongside metabolites like lipoproteins and glucose in a MannâWhitney U or t-test framework, examine how multivariate considerations could affect the decision between these tests when assessing associations within each Apo-E4 subgroup.\n",
      "6. Reflect on using SPSS software for this analysis; discuss its capabilities to handle nonparametric versus parametric data and whether it would facilitate or simplify your choice of statistical test based upon assumptions about normality, sample size requirements (above 50), potential outliers' influence, gender disparitiesâ impacts alongside age adjustments.\n",
      "7.

      "8. Given all these aspects, synthesize a detailed recommendation report addressing which statistical test would likely be most appropriate between MannâWhitney U versus independent t-test and justify each point rigorously considering skewed distributions caused by outliers or potential gender variance within age groups alongside adjustments for sex as well as multiple covariates.\n",
      "8 points, making sure your final analysis thoroughly integrates all these considerations while not leaning on actual data provided in the input but rather exploring statistical principles related to choosing between MannâWhitney U and independent t-test when dealing with complex multivariate Alzheimerâs research involving various biomarkers where gender disparity, age adjustments (alongside potential outliers), along with nonnormal distribution of SD are factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your report must demonstrate an understanding that this complexity requires a nuanced interpretation and may not lend itself to the simplicity afforded by either test alone; therefore you should elaborate on how each factor plays into your final recommendation for which statistical method would be most appropriate given these specific complexities, ultimately aiming towards robustness in conclusions drawn from such analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Your task:Delve deeply into the above multifac0rk aspects of Alzheimerâs disease research while selecting between nonparametric MannâWhitney U and parametric t-test methods for comparing standard deviations within negative vs positive ApoE4 groups, with a particular emphasis on how these tests handle outliers or skewed distributions. Extend this analysis further to include gender disparity impacts alongside age adjustments using SPSS software capabilities without leaning heavily on the specific details of SD distribution as provided in your initial description â which lacks concrete numbers but offers enough context for such an exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant: \n",
      "In considering whether a MannâWhitney U test or independent-sample t-test is appropriate when comparing standard deviations (SD) between negative and positive Alzheimer's Disease Patient groups with varying ApoE4 statuses, we must first understand the underlying assumptions of each statistical method.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Assessment Based on Normality:** The MannâWhitney U test is nonparametric (a type II hypothesis) and makes no assumption about data normal distribution; therefore it's ideal when sample distributions are not expected to follow a Gaussian curve or if thereâs significant skewness in the SD, as these conditions would violate t-test assumptions. Conversely, an independent two-sample parametric (t-test) assumes normally distributed differences between means and is less robust against nonnormality but more powerful when this assumption holds true.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Handling Outliers:** The MannâWhitney U test may be preferred in the presence of outliers since it compares medians, which are generally not as affected by extreme scores compared to mean values considered under t-tests that assume a symmetric distribution around means (which can greatly influence results).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Gender Differences:** Considering gender disparities is crucial in Alzheimerâs disease research due to differing prevalence and progression of the condition between sexes, which could manifest as variability within SD among genders. The MannâWhitney U test doesn't assume equal variances or distributions across groups (like independent t-tests), providing a safer alternative if we expect significant gender differences impacting standard deviations in each ApoE4 subgroup without precise information on the extent of these disparities provided by SPSS adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Age Adjustment:** Alzheimerâs research often involves age as an important covariate; using partial correlation tests to control for gender-related SD differences within E4 statuses, and consequently incorporating this into the MannâWhitney U test framework would likely result in a more accurate reflection of what's unique about ApoE4 effects by removing some variance attributed solely to age.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Multivariate Considerations:** When assessing multiple biomarkers, such as CSF amyloid levels along with metabolites like lipoproteins and glucose within each subgroup of patients carrying the ApoE4 allele (negative vs positive), employment in SPSS might involve multivariable analysis. MannâWhitney U can be applied to these multiple variables as it tests for differences between groups, not means or variances â but caution is necessary when interpreting interactions and adjusting for them nonparametrically within the test's framework due its limited scope in handling complex multi-variable datasets compared with parametric methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **SPSS Software Capabilities:** SPSSâ capabilities to conduct both MannâWhitney U tests (with specific options like 'Nonmetropolitan Median Test') and independent t-tests, along with multivariate analysis tools such as multiple regression or ANCOVA that adjust for covariates including age can help account for these complexities. For SD comparisons though it's typically used to analyze means rather than medians which could be deduced from standard deviation (in lieu of not having specific data), one might use a t-test with unequal varian0ns or transforming the variables before analysis, considering SPSSâ ability for nonparametric analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Robustness and Conclusions:** MannâWhitney U is generally more robust in cases where distributions are skewed (as Alzheimer's patients often have), hence when significant gender differences or outliers may distort mean-based analysis, it might be a better fit for SD comparison purposes. It also avoids the assumptions of normal distribution and equal variances required by t-tests â aligning with our initial assessment without relying on specific data but rather understanding that nonparametric tests are less sensitive to outliers or skewed distributions where no concrete information about their influence is given in this scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Recommendation:** Given these considerations, the MannâWhitney U test emerges as a strong contender for robustness against potential violations of normality and variances across groups due to gender disparities which are commonplace within Alzheimerâthy research contexts â especially in light of missing concrete data on SD distributions. Moreover, SPSS software can handle nonparametric analyses well; hence it would be beneficial for comparing standard deviations among the distinct ApoE4 groups without relying heavily upon specific numerical values from a skewed distribution that we cannot deduce here â which supports its selection over t-tests in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, considering outliers' influence on SD and adjusting mean scores affected by age or gender variance within Alzheimerâs disease research using SPSS software suggests the MannâWhitney U test as a robust approach for comparing between two independent samples when these factors are present but detailed data about their impact is unknown. However, if specific information suggested that our sample distributions approximate normality and variances across groups were relatively equal despite gender differences or outliers â then SPSS's parametric tests would be the alternative to consider while taking into account proper covariate adjustments for age using regression models within its framework (possibly ANCOVA, assuming continuous predictors). Given our lack of concrete numerical information and skewed SD assumptions in this scenario though, MannâWhitney U represents a methodical choice ensuring robust analysis.\n",

      "{'Abstract': 'Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) concentration has reproducibly been shown to reflect neurodegeneration in brain disorders, including Alzheimerâs disease (AD). NfL concentration in blood correlates with the corresponding CSF levels, but few studies have directly compared the reliability of these 2 markers in sporadic AD. Herein, we measured plasma and CSF concentrations of NfL in 478 cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects, 227 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 113 patients with AD dementia. We found that the concentration of NfL in CSF, but not in plasma, was increased in response to AÎ² pathology in CU subjects. Both CSF and plasma NfL concentrations were increased in patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. Furthermore, only NfL in CSF was associated with reduced white matter microstructure in CU subjects. Finally, in a transgenic mouse model of AD, CSF NfL increased before serum NfL in response to the development of AÎ² pathology. In conclusion, NfL in CSF may be a more reliable biomarker of neurodegeneration than NfL in blood in preclinical sporadic AD.\\nHighlights\\nCSF NfL is increased and associated with amyloid pathology in preclinical AD.\\nPlasma NfL is increased in symptomatic AD.\\nCSF NfL is associated with reduced white matter microstructure in preclinical AD.\\nPlasma NfL is associated with reduced white matter microstructure in symptomatic AD.\\nIn 5xFAD mice, NfL in CSF is increased at an earlier time point than in serum.', 'Method': 'Materials and methods\\nBioFINDER study population\\nThe study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Lund, Sweden, and the participants or their relatives gave written informed consent.\\nThe study population originated from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFINDER study and consisted of 298 cognitively healthy elderly participants, 407 patients with mild cognitive symptoms, and 113 patients with AD dementia from which baseline CSF and plasma NFL samples were available.\\nCognitively healthy elderly participants were recruited from the longitudinal population-based MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer Study between 2010 and 2014 according to the following inclusion criteria: â¥60\\xa0years of age, absence of cognitive symptoms as assessed by a physician, Mini-Mental State Examination score of 28â30 at screening visit, not fulfilling the criteria for MCI or any dementia, and fluency in Swedish. Exclusion criteria were significant neurological or psychiatric illness, significant alcohol or substance abuse, and refusing lumbar puncture or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\\nPatients with mild cognitive symptoms were consecutively enrolled from the Memory Clinic at SkÃ¥ne University Hospital and Ãngelholm Hospital in Sweden between 2010 and 2014. Included individuals had an age between 60 and 80\\xa0years, were referred to any of the 2 memory clinics due to cognitive symptoms, had an Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24â30 at baseline visit, did not fulfill the criteria for any dementia, and were fluent in Swedish. The exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment that with certainty could be explained by another condition or disease, significant alcohol or substance abuse, and refusing lumbar puncture or neuropsychological assessment. Following neuropsychological assessment including a test battery evaluating verbal ability, episodic memory function, visuospatial construction ability, and attention and executive functions, 180 patients were classified as subjective cognitive decline and 227 patients were classified as MCI. In accordance with the guidelines from the US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimerâs Association, cognitively healthy elderly participants and patients with subjective cognitive decline were included in the CU group.\\nPatients with AD dementia were included after thorough clinical assessment at the Memory Clinic at SkÃ¥ne University Hospital in Sweden. All study participants met the criteria for probable AD dementia as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimerâs Disease and Related Disorders Association. Individuals with significant alcohol or substance abuse were excluded.\\nStudy participants who were CU or diagnosed with MCI were categorized into groups with normal (Aâ) or pathologic (A+) CSF AÎ² using the AÎ²42/AÎ²40 ratio with the cutoff <0.091. This cutoff was established using Gaussian mixture modeling. In addition, these individuals were further categorized based on normal (Nâ) and abnormal (N+) cortical thickness in AD-susceptible temporal regions as determined by MRI (see Section 2.3 below) with the cutoff <2.25. As cortical thickness was not bimodally distributed, Gaussian mixture modeling for cutoff determination could not be applied. Instead, the cutoff was defined as mean\\xa0â1.5 standard deviation of Aâ CU cases, which has been commonly used in other studies. Participants with AD dementia were all A+, however, no information on cortical thickness was available for this group.\\nCSF and blood collection in the BioFINDER study population\\nCollection of lumbar CSF and blood samples from each study participant was performed on the same day, where blood was obtained within 15\\xa0minutes of CSF sampling. Lumbar CSF samples were collected according to a standardized protocol, centrifuged for 10\\xa0minutes at 2000Ãg at 4 Â°C, and aliquoted into polypropylene tubes. Blood was drawn into EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged for 10\\xa0minutes at 2000Ãg at 4 Â°C. Following centrifugation, plasma was collected and aliquoted into polypropylene tubes. The obtained CSF and plasma samples were stored at\\xa0â80 Â°C until biochemically analyzed.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging\\nMRI was completed in 478 CU subjects and 227 MCI patients, and the average time interval between MRI acquisition and fluid collection was 17\\xa0days. High-resolution T1-weighted MP-RAGE (TR\\xa0= 1950\\xa0ms, TE\\xa0= 3.4\\xa0ms, in-plane resolution\\xa0= 1\\xa0Ã\\xa01 mm2, slice thickness\\xa0= 1.2\\xa0mm, 176 slices) and transversal T2-weighted FLAIR (TR\\xa0= 9000\\xa0ms, TE\\xa0= 89\\xa0ms, TI\\xa0= 2500\\xa0ms, voxel size 0.7\\xa0Ã\\xa00.7\\xa0Ã\\xa04 mm3, distance factor 25%, 27 slices) imaging was performed on a 3T MR scanner (Siemens Tim Trio 3T; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany).\\nCortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed with the FreeSurfer image analysis pipeline v5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Briefly, the T1-weighted images underwent correction for intensity homogeneity, removal of non-brain tissue, and segmentation into gray matter and white matter with intensity gradient and connectivity among voxels. Cortical modeling allowed parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units with respect to gyral and sulcal structure. Cortical thickness was measured as the distance from the gray/white matter boundary to the corresponding pial surface. Reconstructed data sets were visually inspected for accuracy, and segmentation errors were corrected. To determine AD-related brain atrophy we used the average cortical thickness in a predefined temporal lobe meta-region (composed of entorhinal, inferior temporal, middle temporal, and fusiform cortex).\\nGlobal white matter lesion volume was determined by the use of an automated segmentation method, using the lesion prediction algorithm in the LST toolbox implemented in SPM8.\\nFor diffusion MRI, a single-shot EPI sequence was used to obtain 66 contiguous axial slices with a spatial resolution of 2\\xa0Ã\\xa02\\xa0Ã\\xa02\\xa0mm3\\xa0(TR/TE\\xa0= 86/8200\\xa0ms). The diffusion encoding was performed in 64 directions with b\\xa0= 1000\\xa0s/mm2, and one additional volume was obtained for b\\xa0= 0\\xa0s/mm2. To correct for motion and eddy-current induced distortions, all data were registered to the b\\xa0= 0\\xa0s/mm2 volume using an affine transform implemented in Elastix. DTI analysis was performed using linear least squares with heteroscedasticity correction with software developed in-house in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). Parameter maps for mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated from the diffusion tensor.\\nThe DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) (v 1.03) from the FMRIB Software Library. In this process, FA volumes were first masked with the FSL Brain Extraction Tool and then non-linearly registered to the 1\\xa0mm3 FMRIB58 FA template in MNI152 standard space, using FLIRT and FNIRT. The resulting subject-specific non-linear transform was then applied to the MD map. The maps in template space were then skeletonized by computing of the projection of the FA map onto the FMRIB58 template skeleton. Statistical processing was performed using a significance threshold of 0.05 in Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement and FSL Randomize (v 2.9), with 7500 permutations for generation of the null distribution. When generating the p-maps, multiple comparison-correction was accounted for by controlling the family-wise error rate. Hypothesis tests were performed using the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient for CSF NfL, or for plasma NfL, was zero, using age and sex as additional covariates. The tests were performed separately for CSF NfL and for plasma NfL for each of the 3 groups comprising all subjects, those in the CU group, or those in the MCI group. Due to incomplete data or failure of normalization, 11 CU subjects and 5 MCI subjects were excluded from the TBSS analysis.\\n18F-flutemetamol PET imaging\\n18F-flutemetomol PET scans for visualization of cerebral AÎ² depositions were completed for 382 individuals, including 244 CU subjects and 138 MCI patients. Production of 18F-flutemetamol was performed at the radiopharmaceutical production site in RisÃ¸, Denmark, using a FASTlab synthesizer module (GE Healthcare, Cleveland, OH). PET/CT scans of the brain were obtained from 2 different sites using the same type of scanner (Germini; Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands). 18F-flutemetamol summation images for the period 90â110\\xa0minutes post injection a single dose of 18F-flutemetamol was analyzed using the NeuroMarQ software (GE Healthcare). A volume of interest (VOI) template was applied to define a global neocortical composite region, encompassing prefrontal, parietal, temporal lateral, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus VOIs. The standardized uptake value ratio was defined as the uptake in a VOI normalized to a composite reference region (whole cerebellum, the pons/brainstem, and eroded cortical white matter).\\nAnimals\\nTwo- to 12-month-old male and female heterozygous 5ÃFAD tg mice (n\\xa0= 40), originally obtained from Jackson Laboratory, and age-matched non-tg littermates (n\\xa0= 41) were used for the experiments. Animals were housed in groups of 2â6 mice per cage under a 12:12\\xa0hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Under the control of the mouse Thy1 promotor element, 5ÃFAD mice overexpress human APP(695) with the K670N/M671L (Swedish), 1716V (Florida), and V7171 (London) mutations together with human PS1 harboring the M146L and L286V mutations. Intraneuronal AÎ² appears at 1.5\\xa0months in the deep cortical layers and subiculum, and extracellular amyloid plaques start to accumulate in the same regions around 2\\xa0months of age, spreading to other brain areas as the animal ages. In addition, a reduction in pre- and postsynaptic markers as well as neuronal loss has been reported in 9-month-old mice.\\nThe experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Swedish animal research regulations and were approved by the committee of animal research at Lund University (ethical permit number: 7482/2017).\\nCSF, blood, and brain tissue collection in mice\\nCSF was collected from cisterna magna in accordance with a method previously described. All sample collection was performed between 9 AM and 13 PM. Under isoflurane anesthesia, mice were placed on a stereotaxic instrument and an incision of the skin inferior to the occiput was made. Using a dissecting microscope, the underlying neck muscles were then separated to expose the dura mater of the cisterna magna. A glass capillary tube with a tapered tip was used to penetrate the dura mater and collect CSF. Samples were immediately transferred to protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at\\xa0â80 Â°C until analysis.\\nFollowing CSF sampling, blood was collected from the left heart ventricle using a 23G needle and immediately transferred to protein LoBind Tubes (Eppendorf). The blood samples were allowed to clot for 2\\xa0hours at room temperature before they were centrifuged at 2000Ãg for 20\\xa0minutes. Serum was then collected, aliquoted into protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf), and stored at\\xa0â80 Â°C until analysis.\\nFor brain tissue collections, mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.1\\xa0M phosphate buffer (PB). The brain was removed and the left hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\\xa0M PB, pH 7.4, for 48\\xa0hours at 4 Â°C and then immersed in 30% sucrose solution for 48\\xa0hours at 4 Â°C. Brains were serially cut into 30\\xa0Î¼m sagittal sections using a sliding microtome (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected in antifreeze solution (30% sucrose and 30% ethylene glycol in PB) for storage at\\xa0â20 Â°C.\\nThioflavin S staining and analysis of mouse brain sections\\nFree-floating sagittal brain sections (30\\xa0Î¼m) were washed 3\\xa0Ã\\xa010\\xa0minutes in Tris-buffered saline and then stained with 0.01% Thioflavin S (ThioS) in 50% ethanol for 10\\xa0minutes. Sections were washed 2\\xa0Ã\\xa01 minute in 50% ethanol, 3\\xa0Ã\\xa01 minute in ddH2O, and finally 10\\xa0minutes in Tris-buffered saline. The stained specimens were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped with SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturerâs recommendations. Images of cortex and subiculum from 3 sections per animal were captured using a 10Ã objective lens on an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 LT+ digital COMOS camera. The area (%) covered by ThioS-positive amyloid plaques in the regions of interest was quantified using the Fiji software by applying an automated threshold that was maintained for all images analyzed.\\nBiochemical analysis of CSF and blood from the BioFINDER study population and mice\\nCSF NfL concentration in the BioFINDER study population was measured using a sensitive sandwich ELISA method (NF-light ELISA kit; UmanDiagnostics AB, UmeÃ¥, Sweden). Intra-assay coefficient of variance (CV) ranged between 7% and 10% and inter-assay CV was 13%. An in-house Simoa NfL assay, in which the monoclonal antibodies and calibrators from the NF-light ELISA kit (UmanDiagnostics AB) were transferred onto the Simoa platform using a homebrew kit (Quanterix, Lexington, MA), was used to measure plasma NfL concentration in the BioFINDER study population, as well as CSF and serum NfL concentrations in mice. The core domain of NfL, against which the antibodies are directed, is fully conserved between humans and mice. For measurement of plasma samples from the BioFINDER study population, the intra-assay CV was 5.5% and the inter-assay CV was 8.2% for the low-concentration quality control sample (11.1 pg/mL). For the high-concentration quality control sample (107.0 pg/mL), the corresponding CVs were 9.3% and 9.4%, respectively. Intra-assay CV for measurement of mouse CSF samples ranged between 2.9% and 11.1%, and intra- and inter-assay CV for measurement of mouse serum samples ranged between 3.2% and 8.7% and 6.5% and 13.8%, respectively. The concentration of AÎ²40, AÎ²42, and phosphorylated tau in CSF in the BioFINDER study population was measured by Euroimmun immunoassay. All measurements were performed in one round of experiments using one batch of reagents by board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical and genotype information.\\nStatistical analysis\\nFor the BioFINDER study population, demographic factors and clinical characteristics were compared between different diagnostic groups using the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the Ï2 test for categorical variables. Group comparisons of CSF and plasma biomarkers were performed on log-transformed data using univariate general linear models adjusted for the confounding effects of age and sex. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. Spearmanâs rank-ordered correlation coefficient and linear regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to examine associations between 2 continuous variables. The diagnostic accuracy of NfL in CSF and plasma was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Associations between NfL concentrations and 18F-flutemetamol standardized uptake value ratio were analyzed voxel-wise using SPM12 multilinear regression models, including age, sex, and the time interval between fluid collection and 18F-flutemetamol PET acquisition as covariates. Parametric maps were adjusted for multiple comparisons using family wise error correction.\\nNonparametric statistical methods were used for analysis of data derived from animal experiments due to the relatively small sample size. Three extreme outliers with CSF or plasma NfL concentrations above 3 interquartile ranges of the third quartile were excluded from the analysis. The Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test was performed to study if CSF and serum NfL concentrations increased with age in 5ÃFAD mice and non-tg littermates. This test was also used to study if amyloid plaque load in cortex and subiculum of 5ÃFAD mice increased with age. If a statistically significant trend was found, post hoc analysis for group comparisons between the youngest group an all other groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare the concentrations of NfL in CSF and serum between 5ÃFAD mice and age-matched non-tg littermates. Correlation analysis was done using Spearmanâs rank-ordered correlation coefficient. For comparisons between correlation coefficients, Mengâs Z-test for correlated correlations was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and corresponding graphs were produced in GraphPad Prism\\xa08.'}\n"
