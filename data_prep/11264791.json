In brief, PrAISED was a complex intervention delivered in participants\u2019 homes by PTs, OTs and Rehabilitation Support Workers (RSWs). Over 12 months, participants received up to 50 individualised therapy sessions (median 31, IQR 22\u201340) including supervised exercises, functional activities, support for inclusion in community activities, risk enablement and environmental assessments aiming to improve activities of daily living. Therapist visits were intended to support the exercises and activities, monitor progress and adjust the programme. With the intention of habit formation, therapy visits were tapered, with two visits per week at the start of the intervention programme, slowly being reduced to monthly visits towards the end of the intervention.\u00a0The typical visit would begin with routine questions around participant\u2019s health and wellbeing, followed by a review of the programme and goals. This was usually a discussion between the therapist, participant living with dementia and their caregiver (if any). The discussion was typically followed by an active part of the session, where the therapist and participant would perform some of the exercises and activities in the programme, and where the therapist introduced new exercises and activities, if appropriate. The caregiver would typically observe. The session would end with a discussion in which the therapist, participant living with dementia and caregiver agreed on some action points for the following session. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, session delivery was interrupted and partly completed by telephone and videoconferencing (68% was delivered face-to-face, 26% by telephone, 6% by videoconference). In total, participants reported completing on average 482\u00a0min of PrAISED-related physical exercise per month (range 0\u20135310\u00a0min; 121\u00a0min/week). ",

Another strength of the study was the consistent PPIE contribution throughout the evaluation. The two PPIE members who were also part of the PrAISED research group and are co-authors on this paper (MD and MG) took part in the meetings to develop the initial CMOs, were co-interviewers in eight interviews with participants and caregivers, and actively contributed to the analysis of the interview and video-recording data.
