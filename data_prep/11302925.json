However, their molecular nature and functional importance remain poorly understood. Here, we present a collection of 9 recessive maternal-effect mutants identified in a zebrafish forward genetic screen that reveal unique molecular insights into the mechanisms controlling the vertebrate oocyte-to-embryo transition. Four genes, over easy, p33bjta, poached and black caviar, were found to control initial steps in yolk globule sizing and protein cleavage during oocyte maturation that act independently of nuclear maturation. The krang, kazukuram, p28tabj, and spotty genes play distinct roles in egg activation, including cortical granule biology, cytoplasmic segregation, the regulation of microtubule organizing center assembly and microtubule nucleation, and establishing the basic body plan. Furthermore, we cloned two of the mutant genes, identifying the over easy gene as a subunit of the Adaptor Protein complex 5, Ap5m1, which implicates it in regulating intracellular trafficking and yolk vesicle formation. The novel maternal protein Krang/Kiaa0513, highly conserved in metazoans, was discovered and linked to the function of cortical granules during egg activation. These mutant genes represent novel genetic entry points to decipher the molecular mechanisms functioning in the oocyte-to-embryo transition, fertility, and human disease. Additionally, our genetic adult screen not only contributes to the existing knowledge in the field but also sets the basis for future investigations. Thus, the identified maternal genes represent key players in the coordination and execution of events prior to fertilization.",

This transcriptionally silent period requires the precisely timed function of maternally-supplied gene products during oogenesis. However, knowledge of their molecular nature and in vivo function remains incomplete. Importantly, defects associated with the oocyte-to-embryo transition in humans cause reduced female reproductive success, in addition to a possible increased incidence of miscarriage. The mutants reported here provide access to maternal factors regulating the processes that prepare an oocyte for reproductive competence and embryogenesis. We have identified essential regulators of yolk granule formation, cortical granule biology, and microtubule organizing assembly control. Specifically, we found that the highly conserved maternal Ap5m1 protein regulates yolk granule maturation, which generate essential nutrients and immunity for growth and development in oviparous animals. We characterized the Krang factor, which regulates aspects of egg activation likely by modulating the secretory pathway. The mutants presented here represent attractive genetic models to investigate the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that control the oocyte-to-embryo transition, as well as reveal a collection of genetic factors indispensable for reproduction and survival. Importantly, knowledge of their genetic underpinnings and biological importance in reproduction will also pave the way to investigate the evolution of maternal genes during vertebrate development.",

These molecules make it competent to mature into an egg that will activate and subsequently undergo embryonic development by a process called the oocyte-to-embryo transition. This gradual and tightly regulated developmental program requires the function of gene products, called maternal factors, that are loaded into the egg during oogenesis (reviewed in). Oocyte maturation and egg activation are fundamental to the oocyte-to-embryo transition, but how these events are molecularly regulated is not well understood. In fact, the molecular identity and function of most of the maternal factors orchestrating the embryonic program in vertebrates remain unknown, highlighting the need for developing methods to identify and study them.",

Maternal Vtg, a conserved phospholipoglycoprotein, is the primary yolk protein and a vital nutrient for embryonic development in many egg-laying species, including platypus, but not placental mammals. Once Vtg is internalized, it is partially processed in endosomes and then stored as yolk globules (YGs) during oogenesis (reviewed in). YGs are modified lysosomes and contain hydrolases that process the yolk proteins; however, unlike typical lysosomes, YGs do not immediately process their contents. As important lysosomal vesicles, YGs and the mechanism behind their formation and function could have clinical implications, since the etiology of most vesicle trafficking- and lysosomal-related defects in human disease remain unresolved (reviewed in).",

During oocyte maturation in vertebrates, the oocyte arrests in meiosis II until ovulation of the egg and its subsequent activation (reviewed in). Egg activation is typically initiated by fertilization; while in zebrafish contact of the egg with a hypotonic solution induces activation. Following the activation stimulus, a wave of calcium release initiated at the sperm entry point triggers the exocytosis of secretory vesicles called cortical granules (CGs). Additionally, meiosis II resumes and is completed with extrusion of the second polar body. In zebrafish, the calcium wave also triggers the cytoplasm to segregate to the animal pole to form the single cell blastodisc.",

CG exocytosis prevents polyspermy and provides protection to the prospective embryo in organisms of different taxa (reviewed in).

We examined 716 mutagenized genomes, and identified 9 recessive oocyte-to-embryo transition maternal-effect mutants (Table 1), which failed to produce eggs that were competent to undergo early embryonic development. In addition, we identified 9 maternal-effect mutants disrupting the cleavage stage of embryogenesis in zebrafish. Five of the oocyte-to-embryo transition mutants displayed phenotypes indicating a primary defect during oogenesis, including one new mutant allele of the over easy (ovyp37ad) gene. Four additional mutant genes were identified that disrupt egg activation.",

In zebrafish, the clarity of the yolk is a cytoplasmic indicator of this process. Prior to oocyte maturation in wild type, the yolk is opaque and the bulk of the cytoplasm is intermingled between the YGs in the oocyte. During oocyte maturation, the yolk proteins are cleaved, generating the translucency of the egg (Fig 1A). Three mutants reported here, p33bjta, p26ahubb, and p35aluc, produced eggs that were opaque and lacked a blastodisc, more closely resembling wild-type oocytes than eggs (Fig 1A). The other two mutants of this class, p26ahubg and p25bdth, only produced degenerated eggs (Figs 1B and S1A), indicating a more severe or distinct defect in the oocyte-to-egg transition.",

Hence, we conducted complementation tests between these alleles. We found that p35aluc failed to complement ovyp37ad (Fig 1C), indicating that p35aluc is an allele of ovyp37ad. In contrast, we found that p26ahubb complemented ovyp37ad, indicating that this mutation disrupts a different gene, which we named poached (after a type of cooked egg; hereafter called poacp26ahubb). Among the mutants identified in this screen, only p35aluc (hereafter called ovyp35aluc) represented a new allele of a previously reported zebrafish maternal-effect gene. We did not find linkage between the p33bjta mutation and the SSLP markers tested. However, our analysis indicates that the p33bjta mutation is not linked to the chromosomal intervals of the other opaque egg mutations reported here or previously, suggesting that it disrupts a distinct gene.",

This process is driven by the proteolytic processing of the major yolk proteins during oocyte maturation in stage IV oocytes, changing their refractive index from opaque to translucent. The persistent opaque yolk in these mutant eggs suggests that cleavage of the major yolk proteins during oocyte maturation is impaired. To investigate this directly, we prepared cytoplasmic extracts from wild-type immature stage IV vitellogenic oocytes and eggs, and compared the yolk protein profiles to those of the oocyte maturation class of mutant eggs. We found that the yolk protein composition of mutant eggs of blacp25bdth, poacp26ahubb, p33bjta and ovyp35aluc resembled wild-type oocytes rather than wild-type eggs (Fig 1D), indicating that cleavage of the vitellogenic proteins was indeed defective during oocyte maturation in these mutants.",

We found that the YGs of wild-type stage III oocytes displayed a mean diameter of 14.6 \u03bcm (Fig 1F). In p33bjta, ovyp35aluc and blacp25bdth mutants, the YGs were on average 3.7-, 2.5-, and 1.6-fold smaller than in wild type, respectively (Fig 1E and 1F). The p33bjta phenotype was more severe than ovyp35aluc, displaying a much greater amount of small YGs and no large YGs (Fig 1E and 1F). In blacp25bdth mutant oocytes numerous, smaller YGs were present, but some large YGs also formed, with a few larger than in wild type (over 40 \u03bcm) (Fig 1E and 1F). Thus, quantification of YG size confirmed a significant difference between wild type and mutants (Fig 1F), likely associated with altered YG formation during oogenesis in ovyp35aluc and blacp25dbth mutants.",

In wild type, we measured a median CG diameter of 22.3 \u03bcm and 6.2 \u03bcm before and after activation, respectively (Fig 2E, right). In contrast, in p33bjta unactivated mutant eggs, the median size of CGs was significantly smaller, 11.4 versus 22.3 \u03bcm in wild type. On the other hand, at 30 mpa, the CG average median size in the ovyp35aluc mutant was 32.7 \u03bcm, a value significantly larger than in wild type (Fig 2E). Notably, poacp26ahubb activated eggs exhibited normal chorion elevation (Fig 2B), while a significant number of small (mean 5.3 \u03bcm diameter) CGs persisted (Fig 2E), indicating that the release of the larger ones is sufficient to induce normal chorion elevation.",

However, the most 5\u2019 ap5m1 amplicon amplified successfully from wild type, but was not obtained from mutant cDNA, despite repeated attempts, suggesting a possible splicing defect. Sequencing the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of intron 1 of ap5m1 in ovyp37ad genomic DNA (gDNA) confirmed a splice donor site mutation (G to A) in the exon1-intron 1 junction (Figs 3B and S2B). This results in predicted retention of the first intron in the transcript. Using primers within the first intron and either exon 1 or exon 2, we found that indeed the ovyp37ad cDNA retained the intron, resulting in a premature stop codon in the intronic sequence (S2B and S2C Fig), expected to cause a loss of all functional domains of the Ap5m1 protein. We then sequenced the ap5m1 gDNA and cDNA from the second ovyp35aluc allele and identified a missense mutation (C to A transversion), changing amino acid threonine 27 to lysine (Fig 3B and 3C).

Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the N-terminal domain interacts with another subunit of the AP5 complex. The ovyp35aluc mutation impacts a peptide loop in the N-terminal domain (Fig 3C). The threonine to lysine substitution likely provokes a conformational change that would affect its binding activity. In contrast, the C-terminal or Mu homology domain may be the site of specific cargo recognition and interaction. Importantly, the AP5m1 C-terminal domain showed high conservation with acidic residues of the adaptor protein complex 4 mu4 (AP4m4) subunit C-terminal domain and its overall predicted structure (Fig 3E). AP4m4 is a subunit of the human AP4 complex (another heterotetramer involved in vesicle trafficking), and plays a role in mediating the transport of cargo from the Golgi to endosomes; thus suggesting that AP5m1 could function in endosomal trafficking during oogenesis.",

We examined two processes of egg activation in these mutants, chorion expansion and cytoplasmic segregation. Immediately after wild-type eggs are laid and prior to their activation, the chorion is closely associated with the egg surface (Fig 4A). Following egg activation, the chorion elevates due to CG exocytosis and the blastodisc forms by the initiation of cytoplasmic transport to the animal pole. We found that the krangp30ahub mutant showed a severe, highly penetrant small chorion phenotype (Fig 4A). The three other mutants, spottyp08bdth, p28tabj, and kazup26thbd, displayed abnormalities in cytoplasmic subcellular reorganization, subsequent cell cleavage and blastoderm formation, but did not compromise chorion elevation (Fig 4A).",

The spotty, p28tabj and kazu mutant zygotes showed marked changes in the organization of cytoplasm distributed in the yolk cell during the first phase of cytoplasmic segregation (Fig 4B, 20 mpf). During the fast phase of cytoplasmic segregation when axial streamers form, the distribution of membranous organelles was also affected in the mutant zygotes (Fig 4C, 40 min, 1-cell stage). Cytoplasmic patches in various regions of the yolk cell were present at the 4- and 8-cell stages in these mutants but not wild type (Fig 4B and 4C). Thus, defective cytoplasmic organization and animal-ward streaming, likely explain its retention in the yolk cell in all mutant zygotes studied.

We found that both small and large CGs formed and were cortically distributed in krang eggs before activation (Fig 5B). However, at 20 mpa, CGs persisted in the mutant egg, along with numerous small CG-like vesicles showing reduced MPA staining within the vesicle (Figs 5B, 5C, and S3A and S1 Video). By counting the number of CGs per DLR (determined lateral region, see Methods) at different time points after egg activation, we found, as expected, rapid CG exocytosis in wild type, while no such phenomenon occurred in the mutant eggs (Fig 5C). Although unactivated krang mutant eggs did not exhibit a significantly reduced count of CGs, the number remaining at multiple time points following egg activation showed a significant difference (Fig 5C). Furthermore, in krangp30ahub mutants, the rate of CG exocytosis was slower from 0 to 20 mpa (Fig 5C). Quantitative analysis of CG size showed that their mean diameter at 30 mpa is significantly larger in the mutant at 34.3 \u03bcm, than in wild type, at 11.9 \u03bcm (S3B Fig). In wild type, the median CG size was 10 \u03bcm with a similar 11.3 \u03bcm median size in krang mutants (S3B Fig). These measurements suggest a retention of larger CGs, accompanied by many small CGs, unlike in wild type (Figs 5B, S3A, and S3B).",

In the zebrafish, the structure of the vitelline envelope consists of three zones organized horizontally around the oocyte.

We mapped the krangp30ahub mutation to chromosome 18 between markers z65576 and z10008. In testing 1380 females for recombination in the interval, we finely mapped the critical interval of the mutation to 0.87 cM between markers CR925798-1 (38.93 cM) and z58289 (39.8 cM) (Fig 6A). We performed a genomic DNA sequence capture of the entire 1.2 Mb interval from a krangp30ahub homozygote and wild-type control, followed by next generation sequencing of the captured DNA. Sequence analysis revealed only 3 single base pair (bp) changes within the physical interval of the mutant gene. Two of the changes were in a large first intron of a gene and the third was in the coding sequence of the same gene. This coding sequence change did not alter the Gly amino acid encoded, but was a wobble codon change from GGC to GGT. None of the changes appeared deleterious, but all were present in the same gene, kiaa0513. Thus, we cloned and sequenced the cDNA of kiaa0513 from krangp30ahub and wild-type ovaries to determine if it was affected. Interestingly, sequencing of the cDNA revealed a 35 nucleotide (nt) deletion at the 3\u2019-end of exon 3, precisely at the position of the wobble alteration (Fig 6B). Thus, the wobble mutation (C to T) created an earlier splice donor site 35 nts upstream of the wild-type donor splice site (Fig 6A and 6B), generating a transcript lacking 35 nts of the coding sequence.",

In zebrafish the extent of cytoplasmic segregation from the yolk into the blastodisc also determines the cleavage stage cell sizes. We found that the eggs of the maternal-effect kazup26thbd mutant display a small blastodisc, and the early cell divisions are characterized by asymmetric and irregular cleavage, generating smaller and less compacted blastomeres (Fig 7A and 7B). Additionally, the cytoplasm persisted within the yolk and cell detachment was also observed in kazup26thbd cleavage stage mutants (Figs 3B and 7A, 5 hpf). Most kazup26thbd mutant embryos failed to develop beyond the sphere stage and died during this period. However, those that survive generally show a reduced body axis (S6A Fig). These results are consistent with a defect in fully segregating the cytoplasm from the yolk cell, with cytoplasm persisting within the yolk at the 4-cell stage and beyond.",

In the wild-type zygote, \u03b3-tubulin is perinuclearly dispersed (Fig 8B). However, the pattern of \u03b3-tubulin distribution was dramatically altered in the mutant zygote with numerous stained aggregates localized around an unusual nuclear architecture in the blastodisc (Fig 8B). Such nuclear organization suggested defective pronuclei behavior and nucleus formation. Fixed DAPI stained wild-type unactivated eggs revealed the establishment of a metaphase plate during meiosis II (Fig 8C). However, several small DAPI spots, possibly dispersed individual or fragmented chromosomes were detected in spotty mutant eggs. This suggests that the maternal DNA integrity is compromised by a likely defective meiotic cell cycle in the oocyte. These results reveal that Spotty is essential to: a) regulate or maintain meiosis II metaphase plate integrity and thus chromosome segregation and mononuclear assembly after fertilization, and b) regulate spatially restricted \u03b3-tubulin localization during the first mitotic cell cycle.",

Rather, multiple parallel, coordinated events that do not all depend on successful completion of earlier steps in the process. For example, most of the opaque egg mutants can complete nuclear maturation (meiosis) even though cytoplasmic maturation is compromised during oogenesis. The maternal-effect krang, kazu, p28tabj and spotty mutants show overtly normal development of the oocyte, including maturation of the cytoplasm and nucleus.

While separable genetically, other maternal-effect mutants show defects encompassing all or many aspects of egg activation, reflecting components acting in early steps of egg activation. For example, brom bones/ptbp1a is defective in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production and the Ca2+ wave that triggers egg activation, thus affecting all aspects of egg activation.

It is possible that Kazu acts in blastodisc size acquisition by regulating the rate of the animal-ward cytoplasmic flow from the yolk cell, possibly in response to a calcium signal to appropriately allocate the subcellular yolk cell cytoplasmic domains to the zygote (reviewed in). Actin, MTs, molecular motors and their regulators have been implicated in cytoplasmic segregation and RNA translocation through inhibitor and genetic studies. Therefore, it is possible that kazup26thbd and other cytoplasmic segregation mutants disrupt upstream regulators or downstream targets of Actin/Myosin contractility and/or MT dynamics during egg activation. Ultimately, these cytoplasmic transportation defects may affect the arrival of maternal determinants to the developing blastodisc. Future transcript localization analysis in kazup26thbd, and other cytoplasmic segregation mutants, would test this hypothesis.",

Intriguingly, multiple MTOCs/centrosomes are a hallmark in a growing list of human cancers, emphasizing the importance of regulating MTOC properties and number in health and disease.

This may be a particularly challenging task in the egg, which is chock full of the factors needed to generate the multitude of centrosomes and MTs that function during early cleavage divisions prior to zygotic genome activation. There are few known regulators of centrosome elimination and copy number control. In Drosophila, centrosome elimination is determined by Polo kinase activity and the reduction of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, which causes centriole loss before meiosis initiates.

Additionally, the temporal, geometric and spatial organization of MTs and \u03b3-Tubulin in the spotty mutant reveal two important features of its genetic product and the mechanisms behind its activity. First, in addition to the recruitment of \u03b3-Tubulin and other MTOC components, the gene product may be necessary for assembling and positioning the functional MTOCs after fertilization. Second, it may be critical for MT dynamics by negatively controlling the nucleating activity of the MTOC. Determining the molecular identity of the spotty gene is expected to identify a new repressor of supernumerary MTOCs and MT assembly during the oocyte-to-embryo transition. However, the origin of the defect in spotty mutant will require further investigation during oogenesis. Here, we present a genetic and functional model for the in vivo study of MTOC copy number regulation and MT architecture control during early vertebrate embryogenesis.",

To evaluate cutting efficiency, we performed HRM (High Resolution Melt assay) analysis on F0 single injected embryos using MeltDoctor HRM Master Mix (Applied Bio-systems). Optimized flanking primers for HRM are indicated in S1 Table. Remaining injected embryos were raised to adulthood to produce F1 families. To identify the krang/kiaa0513 molecular lesion, we sequenced the amplified PCR product from transheterozygous fish genomic DNA using primers flanking the CRISPR/Cas9 target site (Exon 4-Intron 5, S1 Table).",

Genetic complementation analysis between the two blac mutations was conducted crossing three p26ahubg heterozygous females to either p25bdth homozygous males (n = 2) or a heterozygous male (n = 1). Fish were raised to adults and females tested for the lysed egg phenotype. These mutations failed to complement each other, generating transheterozygous mutant females from all 3 crosses in the expected ratios (10/20, 15/31, and 2/10 females for the three respective crosses). Also, a krangp14del heterozygous female was crossed to a krangp30ahub homozygous male to generate transheterozygous adult fish. Five transheterozygous and sibling krangp30ahub heterozygous females each were tested for phenotype. All transheterozygote females produced mutant embryos with small chorions, whereas sibling heterozygotes produced wild-type embryos. All transheterozygous females were tested at least twice and up to 5 times, reproducibly showing the mutant phenotype.",
