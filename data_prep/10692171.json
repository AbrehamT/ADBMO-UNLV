Developing anti-aging therapies for aging-related diseases requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effects of aging and longevity from a multi-modal and multi-faceted perspective. However, most of the relevant knowledge is scattered in the biomedical literature, the volume of which reached 36 million in PubMed. Here, we presented HALD, a text mining-based human aging and longevity dataset of the biomedical knowledge graph from all published literature related to human aging and longevity in PubMed. HALD integrated multiple state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve the accuracy and coverage of the knowledge graph for precision gerontology and geroscience analyses. Up to September 2023, HALD had contained 12,227 entities in 10 types (gene, RNA, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, peptide, pharmaceutical preparations, toxin, mutation, and disease), 115,522 relations, 1,855 aging biomarkers, and 525 longevity biomarkers from 339,918 biomedical articles in PubMed.

Longevity refers to the extension of an individual\u2019s lifespan and the sustained maintenance of their health status. Research into human aging and longevity aims to explore the mechanisms of human health and life, with the hope of discovering approaches to slow down aging and increase lifespan. Human aging and longevity are mainly influenced by a wide range of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. As the global population continues to age, the study of aging and longevity at the molecular level has become a hot topic in the field of gerontology and geroscience. Precision gerontology aims to provide predictions regarding the individuals\u2019 lifespan under various treatment scenarios, while the main objective of geroscience is to devise novel, biologically-driven therapeutic and preventive strategies that address fundamental aging mechanisms. Understanding the molecular basis of human aging and longevity is vital for the development of therapies to prevent aging-related diseases and extend healthspan and lifespan.",

Currently, there are some publicly online manually curated databases related to human aging and longevity, such as Aging genes/interventions database (AGEID), Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR), JenAge Ageing Factor Database (AgeFactDB), Aging Atlas, and AgingBank (Table\u00a01). AGEID is a database of experimental results that provides formatted gene/intervention reports related to aging. HAGR includes the GenAge, AnAge, GenDR, LongevityMap, DrugAge and CellAge databases that are manually curated by experts and regularly updated. AgeFactDB is aimed at the collection and integration of aging-related data including genes, chemical compounds, and other environmental cues. Aging Atlas is a manually curated biomedical database comprising a range of aging-related multi-omics datasets and bioinformatics tools. AgingBank documents high-quality aging-related associations in more than 50 species by manually reviewing more than 20,000 publicly published papers. However, to the best of our knowledge, these databases are all manually curated, making it difficult to incorporate comprehensive knowledge of human aging and longevity. It is also difficult to obtain the latest biomedical knowledge from manually curated databases as their services are out of maintenance or not updated in time. In addition, although human nucleic acids information is generally involved in these studies, knowledge of other important organic compounds like carbohydrate, lipid, and protein is not yet fully integrated. Relation extraction between these entities is also indispensable for researchers to facilitate integrative and comprehensive analysis. Associations between molecular markers and diseases also must be clarified to illuminate the mechanisms and effects of anti-aging therapies on aging-related diseases.",

Figure\u00a01 illustrates the workflow of biomedical literature mining using multiple NLP techniques. First, we used the Bio.Entrez python package to conduct literature retrieval. Then, we took web-based (PubTator), dictionary-based (Python re module), rule-based (Stanford CoreNLP), and DL-based (ScispaCy and BERN) methods to conduct named entity recognition (NER) for better accuracy. Next, we combined NetworkX, OpenIE, and AllenNLP tools to conduct relation extraction (RE) for wider coverage. Finally, the entities were further identified as human aging and longevity biomarkers according to their relationships with aging-related diseases. Up to September 2023, we had annotated 339,918 abstracts from PubMed and curated 12,227 entities in 10 types (gene, RNA, carbohydrate, peptide, lipid, protein, pharmaceutical preparations, toxin, mutation, and disease entities), 115,522 relations, 1,855 aging biomarkers, and 525 longevity biomarkers in HALD. The distributions of entities and relations are shown in Fig.\u00a02a,b. The contributions of HALD are listed as followings:",

Medical subject headings (MeSH) is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences. Each MeSH record consists of one or more concepts, and each concept consists in one or more synonymous terms. The single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP) is a public database within NCBI that documents single nucleotide polymorphisms and other types of genetic variation in the human species. Therefore, we downloaded and pre-processed the files of genes and RNA in HGNC as the standard human gene and RNA dictionaries, including the information about approved symbol, approved name, previous symbols, alias symbols, previous name, alias names, and NCBI gene ID. We queried the concepts and terms of biochemical molecules in MeSH, and collated the entry information of the following six categories as dictionaries: carbohydrate, peptide, lipid, protein, pharmaceutical preparations, and toxin. Similarly, we built disease dictionaries according to disease heading in MeSH. We collected mutation information about alleles and position in dbSNP and organized them into mutation dictionaries. Subsequently, we used the regular expression matching operations provided by Python re module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) to match these ten types of entities in each sentence annotated by Pubtator according to the dictionaries. The entities that did not match the dictionaries would not be retained.",

We conducted word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing on the sentences with relations. We first removed headings before a colon (such as \u201cINTRODUCTION:\u201d, \u201cMETHOD:\u201d, \u201cRESULT:\u201d, and \u201cCONCLUSION:\u201d) in the sentences as they affected the dependency parsing for main verbs formation. Stanza is an NLP library based on PyTorch\u2019s DL framework and neural network algorithms, providing many NLP functions like lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, NER, and syntactic analysis. Genia is one of the biomedical treebanks for better performing biomedical syntactic analysis from biomedical texts. Therefore, we used the Genia tool provided by Stanza to perform word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency syntax analysis on these sentences. Word segmentation was to divide sentences into individual lexical units, while part-of-speech tagging marked the parts of speech of verbs. Verb part-of-speech taggings included verb base (VB), verb past tense (VBD), verb present participle (VBG), verb past participle (VBN), verb non-3rd person singular present (VBP), and verb 3rd person singular present (VBZ). Since the verbs in VB, VBD, VBG, VBP, and VBZ tenses must express the active relationship, we directly transformed them into the original form of the verb to represent the active form of the main verb. However, verbs whose part of speech was VBN may express either an active relationship or a passive relationship, and it was necessary to further study the grammatical relationship between different words through dependency syntactic analysis. A relationship is passive if the past participle of the verb is preceded by the verb \u201cbe\u201d or its conjugations, or as a complement to modify the subject or object in the sentence. After the above steps, the main verbs were all transformed into the original form expressing the active relationship and the past participle form expressing the passive relationship, so that they could accurately reflect the directionality of the relationship.",

It may be because HALD only extracted longevity-related entities with negative relationships mentioned in the title and abstract, while LongevityMap and AgingBank primarily curated entities from the full text manually. Furthermore, the top 10 aging and longevity-related genes in HALD were used to compare with the other databases (Table\u00a03). These genes in HALD had high coverage with all the other databases except AgingBank (Pro). Considering that limited words extracted from a sentence might not accurately divide the entities into aging and longevity-related biomarkers, we also considered combining the biomarkers of aging and longevity in HALD together and compare them with the other five databases. We found that approximately 50% of genes overlapped except LongevityMap, and the proportion of the top ten overlapping genes has shown a significant increase in AgingBank.",

We filtered all biomedical entities related to mammals from the literature and compared them with the entities collected in HALD. Apart from the telomere attrition feature, the other eight aging features all contained a certain number of entities. This is mainly because entities of telomere attrition tend to relate to the length of telomeres. In total, we extracted 37 different entities from the articles, all of which were found to match the entities in HALD after normalization (Table\u00a0S1). We predicted the relationships of these entities (Fig.\u00a03) and found that all the entities were connected through the network except HSPA1A. Furthermore, we compared these entities with the biomarkers for aging and longevity identified in HALD and found that 33 out of 37 matched, except for HP1\u03b1, Hsp72, PGC-1\u03b1, and PGC-1\u03b2.
