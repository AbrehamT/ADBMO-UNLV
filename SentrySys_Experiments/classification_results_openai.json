NfL concentration in blood correlates with the corresponding CSF levels, but few studies have directly compared the reliability of these 2 markers in sporadic AD. Herein, we measured plasma and CSF concentrations of NfL in 478 cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects, 227 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 113 patients with AD dementia. We found that the concentration of NfL in CSF, but not in plasma, was increased in response to A\u03b2 pathology in CU subjects. Both CSF and plasma NfL concentrations were increased in patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. Furthermore, only NfL in CSF was associated with reduced white matter microstructure in CU subjects. Finally, in a transgenic mouse model of AD, CSF NfL increased before serum NfL in response to the development of A\u03b2 pathology. In conclusion, NfL in CSF may be a more reliable biomarker of neurodegeneration than NfL in blood in preclinical sporadic AD.\nHighlights\nCSF NfL is increased and associated with amyloid pathology in preclinical AD.\nPlasma NfL is increased in symptomatic AD.\nCSF NfL is associated with reduced white matter microstructure in preclinical AD.\nPlasma NfL is associated with reduced white matter microstructure in symptomatic AD.\nIn 5xFAD mice, NfL in CSF is increased at an earlier time point than in serum.", "Method": "Materials and methods\nBioFINDER study population\nThe study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Lund, Sweden, and the participants or their relatives gave written informed consent.\nThe study population originated from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFINDER study and consisted of 298 cognitively healthy elderly participants, 407 patients with mild cognitive symptoms, and 113 patients with AD dementia from which baseline CSF and plasma NFL samples were available.\nCognitively healthy elderly participants were recruited from the longitudinal population-based Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study between 2010 and 2014 according to the following inclusion criteria: \u226560\u00a0years of age, absence of cognitive symptoms as assessed by a physician, Mini-Mental State Examination score of 28\u201330 at screening visit, not fulfilling the criteria for MCI or any dementia, and fluency in Swedish. Exclusion criteria were significant neurological or psychiatric illness, significant alcohol or substance abuse, and refusing lumbar puncture or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nPatients with mild cognitive symptoms were consecutively enrolled from the Memory Clinic at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital and \u00c4ngelholm Hospital in Sweden between 2010 and 2014. Included individuals had an age between 60 and 80\u00a0years, were referred to any of the 2 memory clinics due to cognitive symptoms, had an Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24\u201330 at baseline visit, did not fulfill the criteria for any dementia, and were fluent in Swedish. The exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment that with certainty could be explained by another condition or disease, significant alcohol or substance abuse, and refusing lumbar puncture or neuropsychological assessment. Following neuropsychological assessment including a test battery evaluating verbal ability, episodic memory function, visuospatial construction ability, and attention and executive functions, 180 patients were classified as subjective cognitive decline and 227 patients were classified as MCI. In accordance with the guidelines from the US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer\u2019s Association, cognitively healthy elderly participants and patients with subjective cognitive decline were included in the CU group.\nPatients with AD dementia were included after thorough clinical assessment at the Memory Clinic at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital in Sweden. All study participants met the criteria for probable AD dementia as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders Association. Individuals with significant alcohol or substance abuse were excluded.\nStudy participants who were CU or diagnosed with MCI were categorized into groups with normal (A\u2212) or pathologic (A+) CSF A\u03b2 using the A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio with the cutoff <0.091. This cutoff was established using Gaussian mixture modeling. In addition, these individuals were further categorized based on normal (N\u2212) and abnormal (N+) cortical thickness in AD-susceptible temporal regions as determined by MRI (see Section 2.3 below) with the cutoff <2.25. As cortical thickness was not bimodally distributed, Gaussian mixture modeling for cutoff determination could not be applied. Instead, the cutoff was defined as mean\u00a0\u22121.5 standard deviation of A\u2212 CU cases, which has been commonly used in other studies. Participants with AD dementia were all A+, however, no information on cortical thickness was available for this group.\nCSF and blood collection in the BioFINDER study population\nCollection of lumbar CSF and blood samples from each study participant was performed on the same day, where blood was obtained within 15\u00a0minutes of CSF sampling. Lumbar CSF samples were collected according to a standardized protocol, centrifuged for 10\u00a0minutes at 2000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C, and aliquoted into polypropylene tubes. Blood was drawn into EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged for 10\u00a0minutes at 2000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C. Following centrifugation, plasma was collected and aliquoted into polypropylene tubes. The obtained CSF and plasma samples were stored at\u00a0\u221280 \u00b0C until biochemically analyzed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMRI was completed in 478 CU subjects and 227 MCI patients, and the average time interval between MRI acquisition and fluid collection was 17\u00a0days. High-resolution T1-weighted MP-RAGE (TR\u00a0= 1950\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0= 3.4\u00a0ms, in-plane resolution\u00a0= 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 mm2, slice thickness\u00a0= 1.2\u00a0mm, 176 slices) and transversal T2-weighted FLAIR (TR\u00a0= 9000\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0= 89\u00a0ms, TI\u00a0= 2500\u00a0ms, voxel size 0.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 mm3, distance factor 25%, 27 slices) imaging was performed on a 3T MR scanner (Siemens Tim Trio 3T; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany).\nCortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed with the FreeSurfer image analysis pipeline v5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Briefly, the T1-weighted images underwent correction for intensity homogeneity, removal of non-brain tissue, and segmentation into gray matter and white matter with intensity gradient and connectivity among voxels. Cortical modeling allowed parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units with respect to gyral and sulcal structure. Cortical thickness was measured as the distance from the gray/white matter boundary to the corresponding pial surface. Reconstructed data sets were visually inspected for accuracy, and segmentation errors were corrected. To determine AD-related brain atrophy we used the average cortical thickness in a predefined temporal lobe meta-region (composed of entorhinal, inferior temporal, middle temporal, and fusiform cortex).\nGlobal white matter lesion volume was determined by the use of an automated segmentation method, using the lesion prediction algorithm in the LST toolbox implemented in SPM8.\nFor diffusion MRI, a single-shot EPI sequence was used to obtain 66 contiguous axial slices with a spatial resolution of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm3\u00a0(TR/TE\u00a0= 86/8200\u00a0ms). The diffusion encoding was performed in 64 directions with b\u00a0= 1000\u00a0s/mm2, and one additional volume was obtained for b\u00a0= 0\u00a0s/mm2. To correct for motion and eddy-current induced distortions, all data were registered to the b\u00a0= 0\u00a0s/mm2 volume using an affine transform implemented in Elastix. DTI analysis was performed using linear least squares with heteroscedasticity correction with software developed in-house in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). Parameter maps for mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated from the diffusion tensor.\nThe DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) (v 1.03) from the FMRIB Software Library. In this process, FA volumes were first masked with the FSL Brain Extraction Tool and then non-linearly registered to the 1\u00a0mm3 FMRIB58 FA template in MNI152 standard space, using FLIRT and FNIRT. The resulting subject-specific non-linear transform was then applied to the MD map. The maps in template space were then skeletonized by computing of the projection of the FA map onto the FMRIB58 template skeleton. Statistical processing was performed using a significance threshold of 0.05 in Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement and FSL Randomize (v 2.9), with 7500 permutations for generation of the null distribution. When generating the p-maps, multiple comparison-correction was accounted for by controlling the family-wise error rate. Hypothesis tests were performed using the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient for CSF NfL, or for plasma NfL, was zero, using age and sex as additional covariates. The tests were performed separately for CSF NfL and for plasma NfL for each of the 3 groups comprising all subjects, those in the CU group, or those in the MCI group. Due to incomplete data or failure of normalization, 11 CU subjects and 5 MCI subjects were excluded from the TBSS analysis.\n18F-flutemetamol PET imaging\n18F-flutemetomol PET scans for visualization of cerebral A\u03b2 depositions were completed for 382 individuals, including 244 CU subjects and 138 MCI patients. Production of 18F-flutemetamol was performed at the radiopharmaceutical production site in Ris\u00f8, Denmark, using a FASTlab synthesizer module (GE Healthcare, Cleveland, OH). PET/CT scans of the brain were obtained from 2 different sites using the same type of scanner (Germini; Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands). 18F-flutemetamol summation images for the period 90\u2013110\u00a0minutes post injection a single dose of 18F-flutemetamol was analyzed using the NeuroMarQ software (GE Healthcare). A volume of interest (VOI) template was applied to define a global neocortical composite region, encompassing prefrontal, parietal, temporal lateral, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus VOIs. The standardized uptake value ratio was defined as the uptake in a VOI normalized to a composite reference region (whole cerebellum, the pons/brainstem, and eroded cortical white matter).\nAnimals\nTwo- to 12-month-old male and female heterozygous 5\u00d7FAD tg mice (n\u00a0= 40), originally obtained from Jackson Laboratory, and age-matched non-tg littermates (n\u00a0= 41) were used for the experiments. Animals were housed in groups of 2\u20136 mice per cage under a 12:12\u00a0hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Under the control of the mouse Thy1 promotor element, 5\u00d7FAD mice overexpress human APP(695) with the K670N/M671L (Swedish), 1716V (Florida), and V7171 (London) mutations together with human PS1 harboring the M146L and L286V mutations. Intraneuronal A\u03b2 appears at 1.5\u00a0months in the deep cortical layers and subiculum, and extracellular amyloid plaques start to accumulate in the same regions around 2\u00a0months of age, spreading to other brain areas as the animal ages. In addition, a reduction in pre- and postsynaptic markers as well as neuronal loss has been reported in 9-month-old mice.\nThe experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Swedish animal research regulations and were approved by the committee of animal research at Lund University (ethical permit number: 7482/2017).\nCSF, blood, and brain tissue collection in mice\nCSF was collected from cisterna magna in accordance with a method previously described. All sample collection was performed between 9 AM and 13 PM. Under isoflurane anesthesia, mice were placed on a stereotaxic instrument and an incision of the skin inferior to the occiput was made. Using a dissecting microscope, the underlying neck muscles were then separated to expose the dura mater of the cisterna magna. A glass capillary tube with a tapered tip was used to penetrate the dura mater and collect CSF. Samples were immediately transferred to protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at\u00a0\u221280 \u00b0C until analysis.\nFollowing CSF sampling, blood was collected from the left heart ventricle using a 23G needle and immediately transferred to protein LoBind Tubes (Eppendorf). The blood samples were allowed to clot for 2\u00a0hours at room temperature before they were centrifuged at 2000\u00d7g for 20\u00a0minutes. Serum was then collected, aliquoted into protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf), and stored at\u00a0\u221280 \u00b0C until analysis.\nFor brain tissue collections, mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer (PB). The brain was removed and the left hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u00a0M PB, pH 7.4, for 48\u00a0hours at 4 \u00b0C and then immersed in 30% sucrose solution for 48\u00a0hours at 4 \u00b0C. Brains were serially cut into 30\u00a0\u03bcm sagittal sections using a sliding microtome (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected in antifreeze solution (30% sucrose and 30% ethylene glycol in PB) for storage at\u00a0\u221220 \u00b0C.\nThioflavin S staining and analysis of mouse brain sections\nFree-floating sagittal brain sections (30\u00a0\u03bcm) were washed 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0minutes in Tris-buffered saline and then stained with 0.01% Thioflavin S (ThioS) in 50% ethanol for 10\u00a0minutes. Sections were washed 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 minute in 50% ethanol, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 minute in ddH2O, and finally 10\u00a0minutes in Tris-buffered saline. The stained specimens were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped with SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Images of cortex and subiculum from 3 sections per animal were captured using a 10\u00d7 objective lens on an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 LT+ digital COMOS camera. The area (%) covered by ThioS-positive amyloid plaques in the regions of interest was quantified using the Fiji software by applying an automated threshold that was maintained for all images analyzed.\nBiochemical analysis of CSF and blood from the BioFINDER study population and mice\nCSF NfL concentration in the BioFINDER study population was measured using a sensitive sandwich ELISA method (NF-light ELISA kit; UmanDiagnostics AB, Ume\u00e5, Sweden). Intra-assay coefficient of variance (CV) ranged between 7% and 10% and inter-assay CV was 13%. An in-house Simoa NfL assay, in which the monoclonal antibodies and calibrators from the NF-light ELISA kit (UmanDiagnostics AB) were transferred onto the Simoa platform using a homebrew kit (Quanterix, Lexington, MA), was used to measure plasma NfL concentration in the BioFINDER study population, as well as CSF and serum NfL concentrations in mice. The core domain of NfL, against which the antibodies are directed, is fully conserved between humans and mice. For measurement of plasma samples from the BioFINDER study population, the intra-assay CV was 5.5% and the inter-assay CV was 8.2% for the low-concentration quality control sample (11.1 pg/mL). For the high-concentration quality control sample (107.0 pg/mL), the corresponding CVs were 9.3% and 9.4%, respectively. Intra-assay CV for measurement of mouse CSF samples ranged between 2.9% and 11.1%, and intra- and inter-assay CV for measurement of mouse serum samples ranged between 3.2% and 8.7% and 6.5% and 13.8%, respectively. The concentration of A\u03b240, A\u03b242, and phosphorylated tau in CSF in the BioFINDER study population was measured by Euroimmun immunoassay. All measurements were performed in one round of experiments using one batch of reagents by board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical and genotype information.\nStatistical analysis\nFor the BioFINDER study population, demographic factors and clinical characteristics were compared between different diagnostic groups using the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the \u03c72 test for categorical variables. Group comparisons of CSF and plasma biomarkers were performed on log-transformed data using univariate general linear models adjusted for the confounding effects of age and sex. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. Spearman\u2019s rank-ordered correlation coefficient and linear regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to examine associations between 2 continuous variables. The diagnostic accuracy of NfL in CSF and plasma was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Associations between NfL concentrations and 18F-flutemetamol standardized uptake value ratio were analyzed voxel-wise using SPM12 multilinear regression models, including age, sex, and the time interval between fluid collection and 18F-flutemetamol PET acquisition as covariates. Parametric maps were adjusted for multiple comparisons using family wise error correction.\nNonparametric statistical methods were used for analysis of data derived from animal experiments due to the relatively small sample size. Three extreme outliers with CSF or plasma NfL concentrations above 3 interquartile ranges of the third quartile were excluded from the analysis. The Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test was performed to study if CSF and serum NfL concentrations increased with age in 5\u00d7FAD mice and non-tg littermates. This test was also used to study if amyloid plaque load in cortex and subiculum of 5\u00d7FAD mice increased with age. If a statistically significant trend was found, post hoc analysis for group comparisons between the youngest group an all other groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare the concentrations of NfL in CSF and serum between 5\u00d7FAD mice and age-matched non-tg littermates. Correlation analysis was done using Spearman\u2019s rank-ordered correlation coefficient. For comparisons between correlation coefficients, Meng\u2019s Z-test for correlated correlations was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and corresponding graphs were produced in GraphPad Prism\u00a08."}, "openai_response": "Yes"}, "PMC10612408": {"class": 1, "title": "A blunted TH17 cytokine signature in women with mild cognitive impairment: Insights from inflammatory profiling of a community-based cohort of older adults", "summary": {"Abstract": "Abstract\nPeople with dementia have an increase in brain inflammation, caused in part by innate and adaptive immune cells. However, it remains unknown whether dementia-associated diseases alter neuro-immune reflex arcs to impact the systemic immune system. We examined peripheral immune cells from a community-based cohort of older adults to test if systemic inflammatory cytokine signatures associated with early stages of cognitive impairment. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with monocyte or T-cell-targeted stimuli, and multiplex assays quantitated cytokines in the conditioned media. Following T-cell-targeted stimulation, cells from women with cognitive impairment produced lower amounts of TH17 cytokines compared with cells from cognitively healthy women, while myeloid-targeted stimuli elicited similar amounts of cytokines from cells of both groups. This TH17 signature correlated with the proportion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light concentrations. These results suggest that decreases in TH17 cytokines could be an early systemic change in women at risk for developing dementia. Amelioration of TH17s cytokines in early cognitive impairment could, in part, explain the compromised ability of older adults to respond to vaccines or defend against infection.\nBachstetter et al. found diminished TH17 cytokines produced by activated T cells from women with early cognitive decline, indicating a dementia-linked systemic immunological shift associated with the proportion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light concentrations.\nGraphical Abstract", "Method": "Materials and methods\nHuman subjects\nStudy participants were selected from a larger University of Kentucky Alzheimer Disease Research Center (UK-ADRC) community-based cohort study of ageing and dementia. Informed consent was obtained following University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. As previously described, the UK-ADRC study recruits older adult participants from the central Kentucky region of the USA, and includes \u223c500 active participants that have annual follow-up visits. These visits include physical examination, neurological examination, medical history, and cognitive testing, among other measures. Clinical evaluations and cognitive testing were completed as previously described and followed the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center uniform data set used by Alzheimer\u2019s disease centres. From the UK-ADRC cohort, we assayed peripheral blood from n = 44 cognitively healthy [Clinical Dementia Rating score (CDR) = 0], and n = 40 cognitively impaired (CDR = 0.5\u20131) individuals, with groups statistically similar for gender, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, or obesity), and age as indicated by their previous year study visit data. Exclusion criteria included Type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and current cancers. Blood samples were collected from August 2020 until June 2021. The study coordinator (B.J.M.) provided the de-identified samples to the experimentalists (A.D.B., J.L., and B.S.N.), who were blinded to the participant group identity until all the data had been generated.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation\nFive to 10\u2005mL of peripheral blood was collected into acid/citrate/dextrose-containing tubes by venous puncture. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified by density centrifugation in Ficoll histopaque 1077 using SepMate PBMC isolation tube (StemCell Technologies, Cat#: 85415) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The cells were then washed in buffer [0.1 BSA, 2\u2005mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 1\u00d7 PBS]. Residual red blood cells were removed using red blood cells lysis buffer (eBioScience, Cat#: 00-4300-54), and the resulting PBMCs were aliquoted at a density of 1 \u00d7 106/mL, in freezing media containing 90% heat-inactivated FBS, plus 10% DMSO. The cells were then frozen at \u221280\u00b0C in a Mr Frosty apparatus (Nalgene) for 24\u2005h, before storing the cells in liquid N2, until use.\nCell culture\nAfter thawing rapidly in a 37\u00b0C water bath, the PBMCs were plated at a density of 106\u2005cells/mL/well in a 12-well plate (VWR, Cat#: 10062-894), in glucose-free RPMI media, containing L-glutamine and 25\u2005mM hepes (Gibco, Cat#: 11879020) supplemented with 10% FBS heat-inactivated (Gibco, Cat#: 10438026), 1% pen/strep (Gibco, Cat#: 15140122), and 1% sodium pyruvate (Corning, Cat#: 25-000-CI). The cells were stimulated in multiple batches, and each batch included a random sampling of approximately six participants. The PBMCs were stimulated with Escherichia coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (25\u2005ng/mL, Millipore Sigma; 20\u2005h) or \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 Dynabeads (1 bead/cell; Gibco, Cat#: 11131D; 40\u2005h) in a CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C prior to conditioned media collection. The unstimulated cells were incubated 40\u2005h prior to conditioned media collection. The conditioned media was aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for cytokine assays. The 20 and 40\u2005h post-stimulation timepoints were determined based on prior studies.\nMultiplex measurement of cytokine concentrations from stimulated PBMCs\nSupernatant samples were thawed then centrifuged for 10\u2005min at 1200\u2005rpm to remove debris before being added to a 384-well plate for analysis by bioplex using the Milliplex human TH17 25-plex kit (Millipore) or 96-well Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) proinflammatory or TH17 multiplex kit, following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Samples were diluted in an assay buffer to ensure that the cytokines were in the linear range of the standard curve. The unstimulated cells were run undiluted. The MSD assay was used for cytokines that outside the linear range for the Milliplex kits.\nPlasma biomarker analysis\nPlasma collected from the same blood draw providing PBMCs was analysed on the Quanterix Simoa HD-X as previously described or on the MSD Quickplex SQ 120 using the V-Plex TH17 panel 1 (MSD, Cat#: K15085D), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nFlow cytometry\nPBMCs were unthawed and washed with warm RPMI then washed with PBS. Cells were then stained with live/dead marker Ghost Dye-Alexa Fluor 700 (Tonbo Biosciences) for 30\u2005min at 4\u00b0C according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, then washed with FACS buffer. Human FcR blocking reagent, human (Miltenyi Biotec) was used to block unwanted binding of antibodies to FC receptors for 10\u2005min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were then stained for immune cell markers CD3-FITC (BD Biosciences, Cat#: 555332), CD8-PE (BD Biosciences, Cat#: 555635), CD4-APC (BD Biosciences, Cat#: 555349) for 30\u2005min at 4\u00b0C. Stained cells were fixed with cytofix (BD Biosciences) for 30\u2005min at 4\u00b0C, then washed and suspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide). BD Symphony A3 was used to acquire cell populations. Analysis was conducted with Flow v10.8 software. Fluorescence-minus one controls were used to identify cell populations, and each experiment had single-stained and no-stain controls.\nStatistics\nCharacteristics of participants were assessed with ANOVA, or \u03c72 tests. All cytokine and fluid biomarker data were log2 transformed. For categorical comparisons, an unadjusted t-test or one-way ANOVA were used for the combined data, or for data stratified by sex. Multiple linear regression models were used to adjust mean responses for covariates as listed in the figure and Supplemental tables. False discovery rate (FDR) values for multiple comparisons were applied based on the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg adjustment. Pairwise effect sizes were calculated using Cohen\u2019s d. The effect size for linear regressions was calculated as R2 or \u03a92. Z-scores were created using the sample means and standard deviations of the log2 transformed data. For the box-and-whiskers plots, the box shows the median and 25th and 75th percentile, and the whiskers show the minimum and maximum values.

Compared to men, women experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease. Similarly, male 3xTg-AD mice, developed to model Alzheimer\u2019s disease, no longer consistently exhibit standard Alzheimer\u2019s neuropathology yet experience higher rates of mortality - providing a unique opportunity to further elucidate this dichotomy. We hypothesized that sex differences in the biological aging process yield distinct pathological and molecular Alzheimer\u2019s disease signatures in males and females, which could be harnessed for therapeutic and biomarker development.\nMethods\nWe aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 control mice across their respective lifespans (n\u2009=\u20093\u20138 mice per sex, strain, and age group) and longitudinally assessed neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, markers of hepatic inflammation, splenic mass and morphology, as well as plasma cytokine levels. We conducted RNA sequencing analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and B6129 samples and across ages in each sex. We also examined DEGs between clinical Alzheimer\u2019s and control parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank study in each sex.\nResults\n3xTg-AD females significantly outlived 3xTg-AD males and exhibited progressive Alzheimer\u2019s neuropathology, while 3xTg-AD males demonstrated progressive hepatic inflammation, splenomegaly, circulating inflammatory proteins, and minimal Alzheimer\u2019s neuropathological hallmarks. Instead, 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females. Our clinical investigations revealed that individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease develop similar sex-specific alterations in neuronal and immune function. In diseased males of both species, we observed greater upregulation of complement-related gene expression, and lipopolysaccharide was predicted as the top upstream regulator of DEGs.\nConclusions\nOur data demonstrate that chronic inflammation and complement activation are associated with increased mortality, indicating that age-related changes in immune response contribute to sex differences in Alzheimer\u2019s disease trajectories. We provide evidence that aging and transgene-driven disease progression trigger a widespread inflammatory response in 3xTg-AD males, which mimics the impact of lipopolysaccharide stimulation despite the absence of infection.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13195-024-01492-x.", "Method": "Methods\nAnimals\nColony Maintenance: The 3xTg-AD mice utilized were previously described and were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (B6;129-Tg(APPSwe,tauP301L)1Lfa Psen1tm1Mpm/Mmjax; MMRRC Strain #034830-JAX).

Wildtype controls were bred in-house - C57BL/6J (B6; Strain #000664) females and 129S1/SvImJ males (129S; Strain #002448) were crossed to produce B6129SF1/J mice. Mice were housed 3\u20135 per cage, kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. All animal procedures were approved by Dartmouth College\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Blood samples obtained from sentinel mice underwent quarterly and yearly serology testing with the Multiplexed Fluorometric ImmunoAssay at Charles River Research Animal Diagnostic Services to confirm the absence of pathogens (see Supplementary Table\u00a01, Additional file 1 for list of tested agents).\nHistology\nAntibodies: We obtained beta-amyloid recombinant rabbit monoclonal antibody (H31L21, catalog #700254), phospho-tau (Ser202, Thr205) mouse monoclonal antibody (AT8, catalog #MN1020), and tau mouse monoclonal antibody (HT7, catalog #MN1000) from Thermo Fisher Scientific. We obtained CD45 rabbit monoclonal antibody (D3F8Q, catalog #70257) and F4/80 XP rabbit monoclonal antibody (D2S9R, catalog #70076 from Cell Signaling Technology. Staining: Hemibrains, spleen, and liver tissue samples were collected from animals euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Transcardiac perfusion with PBS and heparin was subsequently performed. Samples were fixed in formalin for 24\u00a0h and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Tissues were stored in hinged biopsy cassettes and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry slides were cut at 4um and air dried at room temperature before baking at 60\u00baC for 30\u00a0min. Automated protocol performed on the Leica Bond Rx included paraffin dewax, antigen retrieval and staining. Heat-induced epitope retrieval using Bond Epitope Retrieval 2, pH9 (Leica Biosystems AR9961) was incubated at 100\u00baC for 30\u00a0min. Primary antibody was applied and incubated for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. Primary antibody binding was detected and visualized using the Leica Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica Biosystems DS9800) with DAB chromogen and hematoxylin counterstain. Quantification: Slides were imaged with a 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009slide scanner and converted to digital files. QuPath software was utilized to quantify antibody staining. For A\u03b2 staining, plaques were outlined with the QuPath wand tool, and plaque surface areas were measured and summated across the sagittal brain section. Total brain surface area, excluding the olfactory bulb and cerebellum due to variation in tissue integrity across samples, was measured. Total plaque surface area out of total brain surface area produced normalized A\u03b2 plaque surface area values for each sample. For all other staining, QuPath automated positive cell detection analyzed the designated region of interest, generating a number of positive detections per mm2 of annotation area. For phospho-tau staining, the subiculum and CA1 comprised the annotated region. For total tau staining, the hippocampal formation and its immediate surroundings comprised the annotated region. For CD45 and F4/80 staining, a representative portion of the liver comprised the annotated region, given the lack of anatomical differentiation. While regions of interest ranged across markers, only a single annotated region from a single brain section was quantified for each stain per individual mouse. For each batch of samples, negative controls that underwent all histology protocol steps except for primary antibody application were quantified using the same methods, and resulting values were subtracted from stained samples to normalize for background staining and technical variation.\nCytokine profiling\nPlasma collection: Blood was collected retro-orbitally in living animals or through the inferior vena cava immediately following euthanasia via carbon dioxide inhalation with confirmatory cervical dislocation. This euthanasia method limited stress induced cytokine expression at the end of life and minimized differences between terminal and retro-orbital (RO) bleeds. Of the 80 total plasma samples analyzed, 25 (10 terminally bled, 15 retro-orbitally bled) came from 3xTg-AD females, 15 (7 terminal, 8 RO) came from 3xTg-AD males, 20 (9 terminal, 11 RO) came from WT females, and 20 (10 terminal, 10 RO) came from WT males. Overall, 71 individual mice were represented, with repeated blood draws only included from 9 mice. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane during retro-orbital bleeds. Blood samples were transferred into 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tubes with edetic acid (EDTA) for anti-coagulation (4uL EDTA/\u2009~\u2009200 uL blood). Tubes were immediately placed on ice and then centrifuged at 4\u00baC for 10\u00a0min at 1000 rcf. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 4\u00baC for 3\u00a0min at 14,000\u00a0rpm. Plasma was transferred to a new tube and stored at -80\u00baC until use. Assay: Inflammatory proteins were measured using the MILLIPLEX Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel \u2013 Premixed 32 Plex \u2013 Immunology Multiplex Assay (EMD Millipore. Corporation, Billerica, MA). Calibration curves from recombinant cytokine standards were prepared with threefold dilution steps in the same matrix as the samples. High and low spikes (supernatants from stimulated PBMCs and dendritic cells) were included to determine cytokine recovery. Standards and spikes were measured in triplicate, samples were measured once, and blank values were subtracted from all readings. All assays were carried out directly in a 96-well filtration plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at room temperature and protected from light. Briefly, wells were pre-wet with 100 uL PBS containing 1% BSA, then beads together with a standard, sample, spikes, or blank were added in a final volume of 100 uL and incubated together at room temperature for 30\u00a0min with continuous shaking. Beads were washed three times with 100 uL PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. A cocktail of biotinylated antibodies (50 uL/well) was added to beads for a further 30-min incubation with continuous shaking. Beads were washed three times, then streptavidin-PE was added for 10\u00a0min. Beads were again washed three times and resuspended in 125 uL of PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. The fluorescence intensity of the beads was measured using the Bio-Plex array reader. Bio-Plex Manager software with five-parametric-curve fitting was used for data analysis. Intra-assay precision quality controls indicated 2.9% coefficient of variation. Data points considered out of range below (OOR\u2009<) were substituted with a 0, the minimum detectable value.\nRNA isolation and sequencing\nIsolation: Brain tissue was dissected from animals euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation with confirmatory cervical dislocation, followed by perfusion with PBS and heparin. Samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00baC. Samples were later placed in a deep-well 96-well plate with stainless steel RNase-free homogenization beads and QIAzol lysis buffer. Plates were inserted into the SPEX SamplePrep 1600 MiniG tissue homogenizer and run at maximum speed for 5\u00a0min. Following homogenization, the tissue solution was added to QIAzol lysis buffer and stored at -80\u00baC. Lysed tissue solution was subsequently added to the QIAGEN miRNeasy Micro Kit for purification of total RNA. Sequencing: RNA for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was quantified by qubit, and integrity was measured on a fragment analyzer (Agilent). 200\u00a0ng RNA was hybridized to FastSelect probes (QIAGEN) for ribodepletion, followed by library preparation using the Kapa RNA HyperPrep kit (Roche) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Libraries were pooled for sequencing on a NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina) targeting 30\u00a0M, paired-end 50\u00a0bp reads per sample. A fastqc report was generated for visual inspection of the data. Raw data were pre-processed by removing adapter sequences using Cutadapt (v3.4), aligning to the mm10 reference genome using HISAT2 (v2.1.0) and quantifying read counts using the Featurecounts function (v2.0.1) from the subreads package to generate a gene expression matrix for downstream processing. Reads mapping to rRNAs were not used for analysis and were filtered from the dataset. Pseudogenes and genes without canonical names were filtered from the matrix prior to further analysis.\nRNA-Seq analysis\nBatch Adjustment: To adjust for sequencing batch effects within our total sample population, ComBat-seq was applied as previously described. Differential Expression Analysis: DESeq2 was utilized as previously described to identify differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and WT controls at various ages using R (v4.3.0) and RStudio (v2023.12.0\u2009+\u2009369). A negative binomial generalized linear model was applied. Differential expression p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Clinical data access: Clinical data were obtained from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study through the AD Knowledge Portal. Parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from females with AD (n\u2009=\u2009103), female controls (n\u2009=\u200939), males with AD (n\u2009=\u200952), and male controls (n\u2009=\u200932) were sequenced and analyzed. Diagnoses of AD or control (CT) were determined based on the clinical dementia rating scale, Mini Mental State Exam, and Braak staging. Age: In the female AD sample group, 1% were in their sixties, 8% were in their seventies, 34% were in their eighties, and 57% were in their nineties or older. In the female control group, 5% were in their sixties, 20% were in their seventies, 54% were in their eighties, and 20% were in their nineties or older. In the male AD sample group, 12% were in their sixties, 38% were in their seventies, 38% were in their eighties, and 12% were in their nineties or older. In the male control group, 25% were in their sixties, 44% were in their seventies, 13% were in their eighties, and 19% were in their nineties or older. Race: The majority of individuals identified as white (91% in AD females, 80% in CT females, 88% in AD males, and 66% in CT males). The remainder were Hispanic or Black, in addition to one Asian control male. APOE genotype: The majority of individuals possessed no APOE4 alleles (58% in AD females, 77% in CT females, 63% in AD males, and 81% in CT males), followed by APOE4 heterozygotes (37% in AD females, 23% in CT females, 23% in AD males, and 19% in CT males), and APOE4 homozygotes (5% in AD females, 0% in CT females, 13% in AD males, and 0% in CT males). Pathway Analysis: Statistically significant, differentially expressed genes (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were categorized into canonical pathways using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Core Analysis and Enrichr. Predicted upstream regulators of DEGs were identified using IPA Upstream Analysis. Over-Representation Analysis: Statistically significant, differentially expressed genes (p\u2009<\u20090.05) underwent Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) to determine if specific gene ontology biological processes were likely present more than by chance. WebGestalt was utilized to perform ORA with the Illumina mouseref 8 reference set. Affinity propagation was applied for redundancy reduction of enrichment categories. Differential expression p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini-Hochberg method.\nStatistical analysis\nSplenic weight, IHC markers, and cytokine concentrations were analyzed using a linear regression model with R (v4.3.0) and RStudio (v2023.12.0\u2009+\u2009369). We tested the overall effects of relevant independent variables (i.e. sex, strain, age) across samples in each analysis. Independent variables were only incorporated into a model if they were matched across all conditions (i.e. age-matched samples of each condition in splenic weight analyses). We also performed secondary linear regression analyses in which samples were organized into experimental groups (i.e. 6-month-old 3xTg-AD females). Experimental groups were then contrasted against respective control/reference groups (i.e. 6-month-old 3xTg-AD females vs. 6-month-old 3xTg-AD males). P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. R-squared values determined the effect size of each regression model. Effect sizes, f-statistics, and complete linear regression results can be found in Supplementary Table\u00a03, Additional file 3. Animal survival probabilities were compared between sexes and strains using the likelihood ratio test, Wald test, and log-rank test for Kaplan-Meier analyses. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the association of sex and strain with mortality risk.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe RNA-seq dataset generated during the current study is deposited in NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO Series Accession Number GSE254970 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE254970).

Gantenerumab is a subcutaneously administered, fully human, anti-A\u03b2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody with highest affinity for aggregated A\u03b2 that has been tested for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted two phase 3 trials (GRADUATE I and II) involving participants 50 to 90 years of age with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and evidence of amyloid plaques on positron-emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Participants were randomly assigned to receive gantenerumab or placebo every 2 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale\u2212Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment) at week 116.\nRESULTS\nA total of 985 and 980 participants were enrolled in the GRADUATE I and II trials, respectively. The baseline CDR-SB score was 3.7 in the GRADUATE I trial and 3.6 in the GRADUATE II trial. The change from baseline in the CDR-SB score at week 116 was 3.35 with gantenerumab and 3.65 with placebo in the GRADUATE I trial (difference, \u22120.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22120.66 to 0.05; P = 0.10) and was 2.82 with gantenerumab and 3.01 with placebo in the GRADUATE II trial (difference, \u22120.19; 95% CI, \u22120.55 to 0.17; P = 0.30). At week 116, the difference in the amyloid level on PET between the gantenerumab group and the placebo group was \u221266.44 and \u221256.46 centiloids in the GRADUATE I and II trials, respectively, and amyloid-negative status was attained in 28.0% and 26.8% of the participants receiving gantenerumab in the two trials. Across both trials, participants receiving gantenerumab had lower CSF levels of phosphorylated tau 181 and higher levels of A\u03b242 than those receiving placebo; the accumulation of aggregated tau on PET was similar in the two groups. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema (ARIA-E) occurred in 24.9% of the participants receiving gantenerumab, and symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 5.0%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong persons with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the use of gantenerumab led to a lower amyloid plaque burden than placebo at 116 weeks but was not associated with slower clinical decline.

Hoffmann\u2212La Roche; GRADUATE I and II ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT03444870 and NCT03443973, respectively.)", "Method": "METHODS\nTRIAL DESIGN\nThe GRADUATE I and II trials were phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials. Participants were recruited from 288 sites in 30 countries (156 sites in 15 countries in the GRADUATE I trial; 152 sites in 18 countries in the GRADUATE II trial) on five continents. Recruitment methods differed across sites and included review of patient databases and local advertising. After screening, eligible participants entered a double-blind treatment period. Some participants were enrolled in substudies that involved longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation for amyloid, PET evaluation for amyloid, or PET evaluation for tau; these substudies were conducted to evaluate the effect of gantenerumab on brain amyloid and tau levels. CSF evaluation was conducted only at sites where lumbar puncture could be performed.\nAll the participants were evaluated for adverse events, concomitant medication use, and vital signs at every visit. Visits took place every 2 to 4 weeks (depending on dosing frequency), either at a trial site or at home (when applicable). Personnel who prepared and administered gantenerumab or placebo were not involved in any efficacy or safety assessments. All clinical assessments were completed by raters who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale was used by raters who had appropriate training and experience, were not involved in safety assessments, and did not receive any data regarding amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Efforts were made to keep the CDR rater consistent throughout the trial for each participant. Different raters were involved in the other clinical assessments. Long-term safety follow-up visits were conducted 14 and 50 weeks after the last dose of gantenerumab or placebo was administered. Additional details regarding the design of the trials and substudies are provided in the protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nTRIAL OVERSIGHT\nThe GRADUATE I and II trials were designed and funded by the sponsor, F. Hoffmann\u2013La Roche. The sponsor provided the trial drug and placebo. Two authors employed by the sponsor analyzed the data in collaboration with academic authors. The first, second, and last authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript with professional medical writing assistance, which was funded by the sponsor. All the authors contributed to subsequent drafts. The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trials to the protocol. Confidentiality agreements were in place between the authors and the sponsor, and the sponsor could not interdict or delay the publication of results.\nThe trials were conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as well as the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted. The protocol and any subsequent amendments were approved by the relevant institutional review board or ethics committee and by regulatory authorities. All the trial participants provided written informed consent. An independent data and safety monitoring committee, which consisted of experts in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and statistics, reviewed unblinded safety data during the trials.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nPersons 50 to 90 years of age were eligible for inclusion in the trials if they had mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease or had mild dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (conditions previously referred to as prodromal Alzheimer\u2019s disease and mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively), in accordance with National Institute on Aging\u2212Alzheimer\u2019s Association diagnostic criteria. Specifically, participants needed to have a CDR\u2212Global Score (CDR-GS) of 0.5 or 1, indicating very mild or mild dementia, respectively. The CDR-GS is derived from an algorithm with six domains; possible scores are 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Participants also needed to have a score on the Mini\u2212Mental State Examination (MMSE) of 22 or higher (range, 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater impairment); cognitive impairment as manifested by abnormal memory, with a Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) cueing index of 0.67 or lower (range, 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance) and an FCSRT free recall score of 27 or lower (range, 0 to 48, with higher values indicating better performance); and the presence of amyloid plaque on visual reading of PET or a ratio of phosphorylated tau 181 to A\u03b242 of more than 0.024 on CSF testing.\nPersons were excluded from the trials if they were taking anticoagulants or GV-971 (an oligosaccharide intended to reduce inflammation in the brain by regulating the gut microbiota) or if they had clinically significant findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening that could cause cognitive impairment, such as more than five microhemorrhages, more than two lacunar infarcts, or a Fazekas score of 3, indicating that confluent areas of the brain are affected by white-matter hyperintensity. Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.\nParticipants needed to have amyloid-positive status on the basis of PET or CSF testing at screening. If amyloid was detected on PET, the participant was eligible for enrollment in the amyloid PET substudy. If amyloid was detected on CSF testing, the participant was eligible for enrollment in the amyloid CSF substudy. There were no restrictions on eligibility for enrollment in the tau PET substudy.\nRANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT\nParticipants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gantenerumab or placebo, administered at a trial site or at home by a nurse. Randomization was stratified according to clinical stage (mild cognitive impairment due to Alzh eimer\u2019s disease vs. mild dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease); apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 genotype (no \u03b54 allele vs. one or two \u03b54 alleles); use of medication for Alzheimer\u2019s disease symptoms, such as donepezil or memantine (use vs. no use); geographic region (Western Europe and Australia vs. North America vs. other regions); and participation in the amyloid PET substudy or the tau PET substudy (participation vs. no participation).\nDuring the double-blind treatment period, the gantenerumab dose was increased over a period of 36 weeks to a target level of 510 mg every 2 weeks, regardless of APOE \u03b54 genotype. Participants received a minimum of three doses at each level: the dose was started at 120 mg every 4 weeks (for three doses) and was increased to 255 mg every 4 weeks (for three doses), then to 510 mg every 4 weeks (for three doses), and finally to 510 mg every 2 weeks. At weeks 12, 24, and 36, participants underwent MRI for confirmation of the safety of dose escalation, performed with the use of an algorithm for the management of ARIA, before the next dose level was administered (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix); MRI monitoring continued throughout the trial (weeks 48, 60, 76, 104, and 116). MRIs were assessed by independent neuroradiologists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The double-blind treatment period was initially planned to be 104 weeks and was extended to 116 weeks in response to delayed and missed visits due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. After completion of the 116-week double-blind treatment period, eligible participants could receive open-label gantenerumab, either under the GRADUATE protocol or after enrollment in the PostGRADUATE trial.\nEFFICACY\nThe primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the CDR\u2212Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment) at week 116. Three outcomes were defined in the statistical analysis plan as confirmatory secondary outcomes: the change from baseline in the score on the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog13; range, 0 to 85, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment), in the total score on the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Cooperative Study\u2212Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL; range, 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating greater functional impairment), and in the score on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ; range, 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater functional impairment) at week 116. Additional secondary and exploratory outcomes are listed in the protocol.\nSAFETY\nSafety outcomes included the incidence, nature, severity, and timing of adverse events, serious adverse events, and ARIA, including ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderosis (ARIA-H). Additional safety outcomes included injection-site reactions, findings on physical examination, vital signs, results of blood tests, findings on electrocardiography, the score on the Columbia\u2212Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and the presence of antidrug antibodies. All safety assessments were completed by raters who were unaware of the trial-group assignments.\nBIOMARKERS\nExploratory biomarker outcomes included the change from baseline in plasma levels of phosphorylated tau 181 and A\u03b242, as well as the change from baseline in the volume of the whole brain, ventricles, and hippocampi on volumetric MRI. Plasma and MRI biomarkers were assessed in all the participants. Additional biomarker outcomes included the change from baseline in CSF levels of total tau, phosphorylated tau 181, A\u03b242, A\u03b240, neurogranin, and neurofilament light. CSF biomarkers were assessed in the participants in whom amyloid had been detected on CSF testing at screening and a CSF sample had been obtained at week 116.\nIn the amyloid PET substudy, the main outcome was the change from baseline to week 116 in the amyloid level. The amyloid level was assessed on florbetaben or flutemetamol PET and was measured as a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), which is the ratio of the standardized uptake value in the composite region of interest to the value in the inferior cerebellar cortex; the SUVR results were converted to centiloids. In the tau PET substudy, the main outcome was the change from baseline to week 116 in the tau level. The tau level was assessed in medial temporal, lateral temporal, frontal, and parietal composite regions on PET with 18F-GTP1 (Genentech tau probe 1, an investigational radioligand for in vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates) and was measured as an SUVR. Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nWe calculated that a sample of approximately 1016 participants per trial group (in both trials combined) would provide the trials with 90% power to detect a change from baseline in the CDR-SB score in the gantenerumab group that was 30% lower than the change in the placebo group, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Assumptions for the power calculation, which were based on earlier studies such as the SCARLET ROAD trial and the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00106899, NCT01231971, and NCT01078636), included the following: a mean change from baseline in the CDR-SB score at week 104 of 2.5 points with placebo, on the basis of expected disease progression and earlier studies; a common standard deviation across trial groups for the change from baseline in the CDR-SB score at week 104 of approximately 2.97; and a true effect of a 30% relative reduction in the deterioration of the CDR-SB score with gantenerumab. A decrease in sample size of up to 35% was also assumed. It was estimated that because of the Covid-19 pandemic, participants would miss a mean of 8 weeks of the double-blind treatment period (i.e., two to four visits during that period) over the course of the trials, which would reduce the power from 90% to 80%. The protocol was therefore amended to extend the double-blind treatment period to a total of 116 weeks to mitigate the effect of missed visits.\nThe efficacy analysis included participants who had received at least one dose of gantenerumab or placebo. Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed according to a fixed hierarchical testing procedure, in the order provided above, for control of the overall type I error at 5%. The primary outcome was the first outcome analyzed in the hierarchical analysis. If the between-group difference in the primary outcome was not significant, the difference for all subsequent outcomes was considered to be not significant. Control of the type I error was performed at the trial level, and each trial had a separate analysis.\nIn line with the estimand framework, primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed with conditional mean imputation followed by analysis of covariance, as implemented in the R package for reference-based mean imputation (R Project for Statistical Computing). In statistical models that used change from baseline as the dependent variable, there was no imputation of the baseline value; therefore, participants missing the baseline value did not contribute to the analysis. When data were missing for a participant after the occurrence of a prespecified intercurrent event that was deemed by an independent adjudication committee to be unrelated to the trial drug or condition, the data were imputed with the standard \u201cmissing at random\u201d assumption; when data were missing for a participant after the occurrence of a prespecified intercurrent event that was deemed to be related to the trial drug or condition, the data were imputed on the basis of the trajectory in the placebo group, with the \u201ccopy increment from reference\u201d assumption. Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were conducted, including a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with adjustment for the baseline CDR-SB score, stratification factors, and key prognostic factors (see the statistical analysis plan, available with the protocol). Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nThe safety analysis included participants who had received at least one dose of gantenerumab or placebo; those who had received at least one dose of gantenerumab were included in the gantenerumab group, regardless of the trial-group assignment.

All participants or their legal guardians gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the Paris Ethics Committee (CPP Ile de France IV Saint Louis Hospital). All participants were Caucasian community dwellers and had caregivers. Inclusion criteria for AD participants were age \u226545 years, probable AD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM IV\u2010TR), and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria and from mild to moderate stage (Mini\u2010Mental State Examination [MMSE] score \u226515). Inclusion criteria for MCI participants were age \u226570 years with MCI diagnostic criteria according to Petersen. Exclusion criteria were non\u2010AD dementia (ie, vascular dementia, Lewy body or Parkinson's disease dementia, and frontotemporal dementia); genetic forms of AD; major depression according to DSM IV\u2010TR or geriatric depression scale >\u00a020/30; other diseases that could interfere with cognitive evaluation; diseases with short\u2010term survival; use of cholinesterase inhibitors or methyl\u2010D\u2010aspartate receptor partial antagonists before inclusion (for participants with MCI); and illiterateness or less than 4 years of education.\nAt baseline, all the participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological, and biological assessments, and participants without contraindications underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain examinations. Cognitive evaluations were performed by neuropsychologists after training programs to harmonize the evaluation. At inclusion, MCI and AD participants underwent a neuropsychological test battery that included global cognitive assessment with the MMSE (normal score 30/30), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (CDR sum of boxes: normal score 0/18). Functional disability was assessed using instrumental activities of daily living (IADL, normal score 14/14) (for the description of all tests performed in the cohort see Hanon et\u00a0al.). MCI participants were then categorized as aMCI or naMCI according to the presence of memory impairment on the free and cued selective recall reminding test related to age, sex, and educational level. Conversion to dementia in the naMCI group was very low (2.5%) compared to the aMCI group (22.4%).\nHabitual caffeine consumption\nThis study enrolled 263 patients (see flowchart in Figure S1) in which habitual caffeine intake was assessed using an in\u2010house validated self\u2010survey, completed together by the patients and their caregivers. At inclusion, the daily intake of caffeine\u2010containing items (coffee, tea, chocolate, sodas) was reported. The daily caffeine intake at inclusion was then calculated as milligrams per day. Participants were dichotomized according to their median caffeine consumption (216\u00a0mg/day), defining \u201clow caffeine consumption\u201d (\u2264216\u00a0mg/day) and \u201chigh caffeine consumption\u201d (>216\u00a0mg/day) groups.\nCSF and plasma biomarker measurements\nBlood and CSF samples were collected at the same time. Investigators involved in the biological analysis were blinded to other assessments. A standard protocol was established beforehand and used throughout the study. CSF samples (>4\u00a0mL) were centrifuged (1000\u00a0\u00d7 g, +4 C, 10\u00a0min) less than 4\u00a0h after collection using the same 10\u2010mL polypropylene tube (Catalogue No. #62.610.201; Sarstedt, Germany), aliquoted into polypropylene protein low\u2010binding tubes (LoBind microtube\u2010ref 022431064; Eppendorf), and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. CSF tau, p\u2010tau181, A\u03b240, and A\u03b242 were measured in duplicate using the same aliquot in a single centralized laboratory (IRMB, Montpellier, France) using commercially available ELISA kits (Euroimmun A\u03b21\u201040 and A\u03b21\u201042, Innotest htau and Innotest p\u2010tau181). It is noteworthy that about half of patients did not accept lumbar puncture, which explains the missing data on CSF biomarkers.\nRegarding plasma, all centers used the same 10\u00a0mL collection tube with EDTA (BD Vacutainer K2E Catalogue No. 367,525, Becton Dickinson, Rungis, France). After centrifugation (2500\u00a0\u00d7 g, 10\u00a0min), the supernatants were aliquoted into polypropylene protein low\u2010binding tubes (LoBind\u2010microtube, Ref #022431064; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Plasma A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptide assay was performed in a single centralized laboratory (Inserm UMRS1172, Lille) using the INNO\u2010BIA kit (Fujirebio Europe NV, formerly Innogenetics NV, Belgium), based on a multiplex xMAP technique with a LABScan\u2010200 system (Luminex BV). Plasma p\u2010tau181 was determined using a commercial Simoa plasma p\u2010tau181 Advantage V1 kit, and plasma neurofilament light (NfL) using a commercial Simoa NF\u2010light Advantage Kit (Quanterix, Billerica, MA, USA) in a single centralized laboratory (IRMB, Montpellier, France). Internal quality controls (IQCs) represented by serum pool aliquots were used to monitor the accuracy of Simoa. All samples were measured after a single thaw.\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT\n Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using traditional (eg, PubMed) sources, meeting abstracts, and presentations. While the impact of habitual caffeine consumption on age\u2010related cognitive decline has been addressed in longitudinal studies and meta\u2010analyses, its impact in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients remains ill defined, in particular regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.\n Interpretation: Our data support an association of lower caffeine consumption with a higher risk of being amnestic as well as with deleterious changes in CSF biomarkers of MCI and AD patients.\n Future directions: The article proposes a framework for future interventional clinical studies aimed at evaluating the effect of caffeine on clinical progression and biomarker changes during the course of AD and at better understanding the associated biological mechanisms.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables are reported as frequency (percentage). Continuous variables are reported as mean (standard deviation [SD]) in the case of normal distribution or median (interquartile range [IQR]) otherwise. Normality of distributions was assessed using histograms and the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test.\nPatient characteristics and CSF biomarkers were compared between the three diagnostic groups (naMCI, aMCI, and AD) using chi\u2010squared test (or Fisher's exact test in the case of an expected value\u00a0<5) for categorical variables and using analysis of variance or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for quantitative variables. CSF data were not imputed as the proportion of missing data was too important and not random. For MCI patients, association between biomarkers and conversion to AD were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The proportional hazards assumption and the log\u2010linearity assumption for quantitative variables were assessed by examining the scaled Schoenfeld residuals plots and the Martingale residual plots. Hazard ratios were estimated with their 95% confidence interval (CI).\nThe impact of low or high caffeine consumption on the diagnostic group was evaluated using a multinomial logistic regression model adjusted on predefined confounding factors (Apolipoprotein E [APOE \u03b54], age, sex, education level, and tobacco consumption). Odds ratios (ORs) were derived from models with their 95% CIs. The same analysis was performed by regrouping aMCI and DA groups using a logistic regression model adjusted on predefined confounding factors.\nThe impact of low or high caffeine consumption on biomarkers was evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted on predefined confounding factors and after applying a log transformation of the CSF biomarkers and plasma NfL levels. Mean difference was derived from models with their 95% CIs.\nAll statistical tests were done at the two\u2010tailed \u03b1\u2010level of 0.05 using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)."}, "openai_response": "Yes"}, "PMC11032534": {"class": 1, "title": "Nanoscale imaging of pT217-tau in aged rhesus macaque entorhinal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: Evidence of interneuronal trafficking and early-stage neurodegeneration", "summary": {"Abstract": "Abstract\nINTRODUCTION\nTau phosphorylated at threonine\u2010217 (pT217\u2010tau) is a novel fluid\u2010based biomarker that predicts onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms, but little is known about how pT217\u2010tau arises in the brain, as soluble pT217\u2010tau is dephosphorylated post mortem in humans.\nMETHODS\nWe used multilabel immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy to examine the subcellular localization of early\u2010stage pT217\u2010tau in entorhinal and prefrontal cortices of aged macaques with naturally occurring tau pathology and assayed pT217\u2010tau levels in plasma.\nRESULTS\npT217\u2010tau was aggregated on microtubules within dendrites exhibiting early signs of degeneration, including autophagic vacuoles.

As described previously, primates were deeply anesthetized prior to transcardial perfusion of 100\u00a0mM phosphate\u2010buffered saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde/0.05% glutaraldehyde in 100\u00a0mM phosphate\u2010buffered saline. After perfusion, a craniotomy was performed, and the entire brain was removed and blocked. The brains were sectioned coronally at 60\u00a0\u03bcm on a vibratome (Leica) across the entire rostrocaudal extent of the ERC and dlPFC (Walker's area 46). The sections were cryoprotected through increasing concentrations of sucrose solution (10%, 20%, and 30% each for overnight), cooled rapidly using liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Sections of ERC and dlPFC were processed for immunocytochemistry. To enable penetration of immunoreagents, all sections went through three freeze\u2013thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Non\u2010specific reactivity was suppressed with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and antibody penetration was enhanced with 0.3% Triton X\u2010100 in 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2010buffered saline (TBS).\nHistology and immunoreagents\nPreviously characterized primary antibodies for pT217\u2010tau raised in rabbits were used, and complexed with species\u2010specific goat secondary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: (1) rabbit anti\u2010pT217\u2010tau at 1:200 (cat# AS\u201054968, Anaspec). The immunogen used keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated with synthetic peptides corresponding to human tau at phosphorylated threonine 217; (2) rabbit anti\u2010pT217\u2010tau at 1:200 (cat # 44\u2010744, Thermo Fisher). The antiserum was produced against a chemically synthesized phosphopeptide derived from the region of human tau that contains threonine 217. Both primary antibodies for pT217\u2010tau produced comparable results; (3) mouse anti\u2010EEA1 at 1:250 (cat# 610456, BD Biosciences); (4) mouse anti\u2010Amyloid\u2010\u03b21\u201042 IgG2b (clone MOAB\u20102) at 1:300 (cat# NBP213075, Novus). This antibody recognizes unaggregated, oligomeric, and fibrillary forms of A\u03b242 and unaggregated A\u03b240, and has been previously used in aged macaque tissue to characterize Braak stage III/IV AD\u2010like pathology; (5) mouse antiphosphoSer202/Thr205\u2010tau IgG1k (clone AT8) at 1:300 (cat# MN1020; Thermo Fisher Scientific); (6) mouse monoclonal casein kinase I\u03b4 Antibody (cat #sc\u201055553, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (7) goat polyclonal casein kinase I\u03b4 Antibody (cat #NB100\u20102919; Novus Biologicals). The specificity and selectivity of the primary antibodies have been characterized using immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay approaches in various tissue types in multiple species. Normal sera and immunoglobulin G (IgG)\u2010free BSA were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. All chemicals and supplies for electron microscopy were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and Electron Microscopy Sciences, respectively.\nSingle pre\u2010embedding peroxidase immunocytochemistry\nAs described previously, the sections were incubated for 72\u00a0hours at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies in TBS, and transferred for 2\u00a0hours at room temperature to species\u2010specific biotinylated Fab\u2019 or F(ab\u2019)2 fragments in TBS. To reveal immunoperoxidase labeling, sections were incubated with the avidin\u2013biotin peroxidase complex (ABC; 1:300; Vector Laboratories) and then visualized in 0.025% Ni\u2010intensified 3,3\u2010diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma Aldrich) as a chromogen in 100\u00a0mM phosphate buffer (PB) with the addition of 0.005% hydrogen peroxide for 8 minutes. After the DAB reaction, sections were exposed to osmification (concentration 1%), dehydration through a series of increasing ethanol concentrations (70%\u2013100%), and infiltrated with propylene oxide. Tissue sections were counterstained with 1% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol. Standard epoxy resin embedding followed typical immunoEM procedures followed by polymerization at 60\u00b0C for 60\u00a0hours. Omission of primary antibodies or substitution with non\u2010immune serum resulted in complete lack of immunoperoxidase labeling. Similarly, labeling was nullified when blocking the biotinylated probes with avidin/biotin.\nDouble\u2010label pre\u2010embedding gold and peroxidase immunohistochemistry\nDouble\u2010label immunoEM was accomplished by pairing gold (for A\u03b2) and DAB (for pT217\u2010tau) in dlPFC of two \u201clate\u2010aged\u201d female macaques, aged 24 and 26 years. Sections underwent a 50\u00a0mM glycine in 0.1\u00a0M PBS incubation for 1\u00a0hour (Sigma, cat# G\u20107126), a 30 minute 0.3% hydrogen peroxide incubation at 4\u00b0C, and avidin\u2013biotin blocking (Vector cat# SP\u20102001) to prevent non\u2010specific labeling from free aldehydes, and the immunoperoxidase product, respectively. Sections were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature (RT; 5% BSA, 10% NGS, 0.4% Triton X\u2010100, and 0.1% Aurion acetylated BSA, or BSA\u2010c, Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat# 25557, in 0.1\u00a0M PB), and incubated in Anaspec rabbit anti\u2010pT217\u2010tau at 1:200 for 72\u00a0hours at 4\u00b0C. After removal from the primary antibody incubation, sections were incubated in biotinylated F(ab\u2019)2 fragment goat anti\u2010rabbit at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch cat# 111\u2010066\u2010144) for 3\u00a0hours at RT, and then underwent avidin\u2013biotin amplification using ABC, as above, and were visualized using a DAB kit (Vector SK\u20104100) with no nickel intensification for 3 minutes. Then, sections were incubated in the mouse anti\u2010Amyloid\u2010\u03b21\u201042 at 1:300 for 72\u00a0hours at 4\u00b0C. After removal from the primary antibody, sections were incubated in Aurion F(ab) fragment of goat anti\u2010mouse ultrasmall at 1:50 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat#25415) for 3\u00a0hours at RT. Subsequently, sections underwent a 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) postfix for 5 minutes, followed by a 10 minute 50\u00a0mM glycine incubation to quench free aldehydes, and a few quick distilled water washes. Silver enhancement was performed with the Nanoprobes HQ Silver kit (cat# 2012\u201045ML) in the dark for 20 to 30 minutes, and produced variable\u2010sized particles.\nSections were first post\u2010fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0,1\u00a0M PBS for 20 minutes, then were submerged in 1% osmium tetroxide in PB, followed by immediate dilution by half (to 0.5%), and the sections incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Sections then proceeded with the remainder of EM processing steps as described in the preceding section.\nElectron microscopy and data analysis\nFor single\u2010label immunoperoxidase immunohistochemistry, sections were mounted on microscope slides and ERC layer II and dlPFC layer III were photographed under an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam charge\u2010coupled device camera. Zeiss AxioVision imaging software was used for imaging and data acquisition. All sections were processed as previously described and immunoEM imaging was conducted in ERC layer II and dlPFC layer III. Briefly, blocks containing ERC layer II and dlPFC layer III were sampled and mounted on resin blocks. The specimens were cut into 50\u00a0nm sections using an ultramicrotome (Leica) and analyzed under a Talos L120C transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Several plastic blocks of each brain were examined using the 4th to 12th surface\u2010most sections of each block (i.e., 200\u2013600\u00a0nm), to sample the superficial component of sections, avoiding penetration artifacts. Structures were digitally captured at \u00d725,000 to \u00d7100,000 magnification with a Ceta complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera and individual panels were adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CC.2020.01 image editing software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Approximately 5000 micrographs of selected areas of neuropil with immunopositive profiles were used for analyses with well\u2010defined criteria.\nFor profile identification, we adopted the criteria summarized in Peters et\u00a0al. Dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex are typically long and thin, devoid of mitochondria, with the presence of a noticeable postsynaptic density (PSD) at asymmetric synapses, and often containing an elaborated spine apparatus, the extension of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum into the spine. Dendritic shafts were typically round in perpendicular planes or irregular shaped when assessed in horizontal planes, usually containing mitochondria and numerous tubular and pleomorphic cellular organelles. Depending on the proximity to axon terminals, various dendritic shafts received synaptic inputs. Axon terminals contained accumulations of synaptic vesicles and the axoplasm of these terminals usually contained neurofilaments and mitochondria. The synaptic innervations made by these axon terminals were either asymmetric, containing spherical vesicles, or symmetric, containing pleomorphic vesicles, with typical differences in PSD, respectively. Unmyelinated axons were small, round processes with a predominantly even and regular shape, traversing the neuropil in a straight orientation, often forming bundles in perpendicular planes. Astrocytic processes were typically of irregular morphology, forming contours that filled the empty space around neuronal elements.\nTo evaluate whether there was concordance between dendrites immunopositive for pT217\u2010tau and signatures of autophagic degeneration, quantitative assessments were performed on a series of low and high magnification 2D micrographs of ERC layer II and supragranular dlPFC layer III. Each field covered an area of 15 to 30 \u03bcm2 captured from the thin sections in early\u2010aged ERC and late\u2010aged dlPFC in rhesus macaques for analyses. Approximately 200 micrographs of selected areas of neuropil with immunopositive profiles were used for quantitative analyses. Autophagic vacuoles were identified based on multilamellar bodies, containing partially degraded cytoplasmic materials. The frequency of pT217\u2010tau positive elements was highly consistent across all animals and pooled across animals within an age group.\nImmunofluorescence with confocal microscopy\nImmunofluorescence staining was carried out on free\u2010floating sections as described previously. Three adult (8\u201310 years), two \u201cearly\u201d aged (18\u201319 years), and four \u201clate\u201d aged (28\u201334 years) rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used in this study. Antigen retrieval was performed with 10\u00a0mM solution citrate buffer in a hot water bath for 25\u00a0minutes at high temperature. The free\u2010floating sections were left to cool for 30\u00a0minutes at RT. The sections were transferred to 1X TBS for 10\u00a0minutes. Sections were then incubated in 0.5% sodium borohydride in 0.01\u00a0M TBS. Sections were blocked for 1\u00a0hour at RT in 1X TBS containing 5% BSA, 2% Triton X\u2010100, and 10% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated for 72\u00a0hours at 4\u00b0C with pT217\u2010tau primary antibody (dilution 1:100; see supplier information above), MAP2 (dilution 1:1000; ab5392, Abcam), mouse antiphosphoSer202/Thr205\u2010tau IgG1k (clone AT8; dilution 1:300; cat# MN1020; Thermo Fisher Scientific), casein kinase I\u03b4 antibody (dilution 1:100; cat #sc\u201055553, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal casein kinase I\u03b4 antibody (dilution 1:100; cat #NB100\u20102919; Novus Biologicals) ,followed by incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C with secondary antibodies (1:1000, Alexa\u2010Fluor conjugated, Invitrogen). After incubation in secondary antibodies, they were incubated in 70% ethanol with 0.3% Sudan Black B (MP Biomedicals, cat# 4197\u201025\u20105), to decrease autofluorescence from lipofuscin, and counterstained with Hoechst (1:10,000, Thermo Fisher, cat# H3570). The sections were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, cat# P36930). Confocal images from ERC layer II and dlPFC layer III were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan Confocal Microscope, with the C\u2010Apochromat 40x/1.2\u00a0W Korr FCS M27 (Zeiss) water objective. Emission filter bandwidths and sequential scanning acquisition were set up to avoid possible spectral overlaps between fluorophores. Images were merged using Fiji software.\nMeasurement of pT217\u2010tau in blood plasma by nanoneedles\nFifteen young (1\u201317 years) and twenty\u2010one aged (18\u201334 years) rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used in the plasma pT217\u2010tau study (total cohort N\u00a0=\u00a036). Blood plasma was collected during routine tuberculosis testing for rhesus macaques. We developed in\u2010house phosphorylated tau assays using the nanoneedle technology to measure plasma concentrations of pT217\u2010tau. More than 20,000 nanoneedles are integrated on a silicon substrate assigned to detect one analyte. Each nanoneedle is a single\u2010molecule biosensor functionalized with antibodies. Because phosphorylated tau in blood samples is present at low abundance, the binding events of phosphorylated tau on the nanoneedle sensor array follow Poisson statistics, that is, one or no molecule is captured on each nanoneedle. This allows precise quantitation of analytes by digitally counting the number of nanoneedles that have a positive signal. In the present study, we developed sandwich\u2010type pT217\u2010tau assays to measure the ultra\u2010low concentration of protein levels in patient blood samples. The nanoneedle chip was provided by NanoMosaic. Nanoneedles are fabricated in an array format with a spacing of 1.8\u00a0\u03bcm. Each nanoneedle has a diameter of < 100\u00a0nm. The nanoneedle surfaces were modified with 0.5% 3\u2010aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) and activated with 2% glutaraldehyde. This enables antibodies to covalently bind on the surface of the nanoneedles. We used 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml capture antibody concentration and incubated with chip overnight. We then washed the chip in PBS and incubated it with blocking solution for 1\u00a0hour. Five\u00a0\u03bcl of plasma samples were thawed and diluted 2 X into the dilution buffer provided by NanoMosaic. The diluted sample was incubated on the chip for 2\u00a0hours. After washing, a biotinylated detection antibody at 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml was incubated on the chip. Next, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml streptavidin\u2010horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was incubated for 30 minutes, and 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032\u2010tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) provided by NanoMosaic was applied on the chip for 15 minutes to illuminate the HRP. The enzymatic reaction produced a non\u2010soluble precipitate on the nanoneedles when the sandwich complex was present. The precipitate changes the local refractive index of the nanoneedle and induces a color shift intrinsic to the nanoneedle property. The nanoneedles are imaged under a dark\u2010field configuration with a CMOS color camera before and after the assay using the Tessie\u2122 instrument from NanoMosaic. Software provided by NanoMosaic analyzed the colors of all nanoneedles and reported the percentage of the color\u2010shifted number of nanoneedles. We used phospho\u2010specific antibodies to pT217\u2010tau (Thermo Fisher 44\u2010744) as the detection antibodies for pT217\u2010tau measurement.

All measurement results were above the lower limit of detection of the nanoneedle assay.

Air pollution may cause oxidative stress and neuroinflammation and contribute to the deposition of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) in the brain. We examined the association between fine particulate matter<2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5), particulate matter<10 \u03bcm in diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and plasma based measures of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 using data from 3044 dementia-free participants of the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS). Air pollution exposures were estimated at residential addresses that incorporated address histories dating back to 1980, resulting in one-, five-, 10- and 20- year exposure averages. A\u03b2 was measured at baseline (2000\u20132002) and then again at the end of the study (2007\u20132008) allowing for linear regression models to assess cross-sectional associations and linear random effects models to evaluate repeated measures. After adjustment for socio-demographic and behavioral covariates, we found small positive associations between each air pollutant and A\u03b21\u201340 but no association with A\u03b21\u201342 or the ratio measures in cross sectional analysis. In repeat measures analysis, we found larger positive associations between each air pollutant and all three outcomes. We observed a 4.43% (95% CI 3.26%, 5.60%) higher A\u03b21\u201340 level, 9.73% (6.20%, 13.38%) higher A\u03b21\u201342 and 1.57% (95% CI: 0.94%, 2.20%) higher A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio associated with a 2 \u03bcg/m3 higher 20-year average PM2.5. Associations with other air pollutants were similar. Our study contributes to the broader evidence base on air pollution and ADRD biomarkers by evaluating longer air pollution exposure averaging periods to better mimic disease progression and provides a modifiable target for ADRD prevention.", "Method": "Materials and methods\nThis study consisted of 3,069 adults aged 75 years or older who were free of dementia at baseline and enrolled in the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS), a randomized double-blind controlled trial originally designed to evaluate the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba on AD and dementia. Participants were recruited from four US study sites (Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Hagerstown, Maryland; Sacramento, California; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) between 2000 and 2002 and followed through 2008. Participants were censored upon death, the development of ADRD or loss to follow-up. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Washington and all institutions affiliated with the trial.\nExposure ascertainment\nPrimary exposures of interest were long-term residential concentrations of fine particulate matter<2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5), particulate matter<10 \u03bcm in diameter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) estimated at participant residential addresses. Address histories dating back to 1980 (20 years prior to study entry) were reconstructed using data from LexisNexis (LN), a data analytics corporation that applies a proprietary algorithm to publicly available real estate, driver\u2019s license, voting and court records to identify residential history. LN has been used by a few previous epidemiologic studies to create residential histories. For individuals missing historical residential address data, we used air pollution estimates from last known residential address. More information on the reconstruction of residential histories can be found in the supplement of.\nA previously-described spatiotemporal model was then applied to individual addresses to predict air pollution concentrations at participant\u2019s address. Briefly, the model uses inputs from EPA monitoring data and over 300 geographic covariates to predict air pollution. External validation statistics show good performance of the air pollution prediction models, with R2 ranging from 0.84 to 0.91 for PM2.5 and 0.78 to 0.88 for NO2. Several exposure metrics reflecting different averaging periods were created to better understand when during the life course exposure to air pollution was most strongly associated with A\u03b2 and to better reflect the development of ADRD. Exposure to PM2.5 was estimated by averaging one, five, ten, and 20 years of modeled PM2.5 prior to the date of blood draw. Estimates of PM10 and NO2 were based only on one-, five- and ten-year exposure metrics because data were not available to create a 20-year prediction.\nOutcome ascertainment\nPrimary outcomes of interest were levels of plasma A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio. The ratio of A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340, both in plasma and CSF, has been found to improve diagnosis of AD relative to A\u03b21\u201342 alone and is used frequently in research. A\u03b2 levels were measured from stored blood samples collected in 2000\u20132002 and 2007\u20132008 using a sandwich ELISA initially developed by Eli Lilly and implemented at the University of Vermont Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry. Interassay coefficients of variation ranged from 3.1% to 7.9% for A\u03b21\u201340 and 12.0% to 20.0% for A\u03b21\u201342.\nCovariates\nCovariates included basic socio-demographic characteristics: continuous age, sex (male or female), race (white or person of color), education (high school or less, some college, college graduate or postgraduate), and study site (Winston-Salem, NC; Sacramento, CA; Hagerstown, MD; and Pittsburgh, PA). Although the GEMS clinical trial was negative, treatment assignment (Ginkgo biloba vs placebo) was included to account for potential differences between the two arms of the original study. Cystatin C (from plasma collected at the same time as A\u03b2) was an additional covariate given its role in binding to soluble A\u03b2 and inhibiting A\u03b2 deposition in the brain.\nA neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) was created for all GEMS participants because of the lack of data on individual income and to account for its potential role as a confounder between air pollution and A\u03b2. Annual NDI values for each participant were based on the census tract of residence and were created from decennial Census data from 1980, 1990, 2000 and American Community Survey (ACS) 2005\u20132009. Previous research used over 30 Census variables to conduct a principal components analysis (PCA) to identify the variables that most strongly represented the latent construct of neighborhood disadvantage. Seven variables were identified from the PCA (% of adults age 25 or older with at least a high school education; % of adults age 25 or older with at least a Bachelor\u2019s degree; % of persons age 16 and older with executive, managerial, or professional occupation; median value of owner occupied housing units; median household income; % of households with income of at least $50,000; and % of households with interest, dividend, or net rental income) and weighted according to factor loadings (see supplementary material for more information).\nCovariates to account for behavioral factors were smoking status (current, former, never), pack-years smoking, percentage of life exposed to secondhand smoke (created by dividing the number of years exposed to secondhand smoke by age at baseline), alcohol consumption (yes/no), and physical activity. We created a physical activity score based on responses to questions from the GEMS questionnaires that are adapted from components of the validated Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire designed to assess physical activity in adults aged 65 years and older. The total physical activity score was calculated from answers to questions about the frequency of engaging in seven activities: gardening and yard work, walking, volunteering, assisting family or friends, hunting, fishing or camping, babysitting and shopping. Response options were \u201cnever or less than once a month\u201d, \u201conce a month\u201d, \u201cfew (2\u20133) times a month\u201d, \u201conce a week\u201d, \u201cfew (2\u20133) times a week\u201d and \u201cevery day\u201d. Responses were assigned a score of 0\u20135 and then summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 35 (potential maximum total score) with higher scores indicating greater physical activity. Missing values were imputed by taking the average of the non-missing responses within each participant if at least 3 of the questions had complete data. In the present study, we used physical activity data collected one year after baseline (nearest the blood sample collection in 2000\u20132002) and carried forward to missing measurements at the 2007\u20132008 visit in participants with non-missing data.\nApolipoprotein E (APOE \u03b54) carrier status (yes/no), hypertension (defined as anti-hypertensive medication use or systolic blood pressure \u2265 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90 mmHg and recorded one year after baseline) and body mass index (BMI) created from measured height and weight were also included as covariates. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was defined using guidelines from the International Working group on mild cognitive impairment and provided for descriptive purposes as was participant\u2019s average score on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE).\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Due to the skewed nature of A\u03b2, a one percent Winsorization was performed, i.e., values less than or equal to the first percentile of the distribution were set to the minimum value. For A\u03b21\u201340 these values corresponded to 56.75 and 28.73 pg/mL in 2000\u201302 or 2007\u201308 respectively and for A\u03b21\u201342 they were 0.75 and 0.77 pg/mL respectively. Winsorized values were then log transformed (Fig. 1). To create A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, we first log-transformed the numerator and denominator before dividing the values. Given the continuous nature of the outcomes, cross-sectional associations were examined using ordinary least squares regression. Repeated measures analyses were evaluated using linear random effects models with a random intercept for participant. Results were reported as percent differences with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nA staged modeling approach was used to assess the impact of adding increasingly more covariates. Model 1 included basic socio-demographic characteristics (continuous age, sex, race, education, study site, treatment assignment, Cystatin C and NDI). Model 2 included Model 1 covariates plus smoking history, alcohol consumption, pack-years smoking, percentage of life exposed to secondhand smoke and physical activity. Model 3 included Model 2 covariates plus APOE \u03b54, and Model 4 included Model 3 covariates plus hypertension and BMI. As these variables are potentially on the causal pathway between air pollution and A\u03b2, they were included at the last stage. We considered model 3 as the primary model of interest. Age, Cystatin C, NDI, BMI and hypertension were treated as time-varying in the random effects models.\nData in 2000\u201302 were carried forward for two individuals missing data on non-time-varying covariates in 2007\u201308. Most covariates had \u2264 8% missing data with the exception of APOE \u03b54 which had about 20% missingness. We implemented multiple imputation using chained equations (MICE) to handle missing continuous and categorical covariates. Separate MICE procedures were implemented for each combination of air pollution metric and A\u03b2 outcome at baseline and repeat measures. Logistic or multinomial regression models were specified to impute missing categorical variables. Predictive mean matching was used to impute missing continuous variables. All covariates were included as predictors in the imputation models, but we also included time-varying 3MSE scores as they are potentially informative variables. Ten imputed datasets were constructed using 50 iterations per imputation. Final models were evaluated on all ten imputed datasets and parameter estimates and standard errors were pooled according to Rubin\u2019s rules.\nIn addition to our main analysis, we conducted a secondary analysis to explore the association between air pollution and A\u03b2 outcomes among those with and without MCI. This analysis assessed whether or not plasma A\u03b2 biomarkers show different trajectories for cognitively intact individuals versus those exhibiting some cognitive impairment irrespective of if they go on to develop ADRD. We ran stratified models for both cross-sectional and repeated measures analysis using only Model 3 covariates and the longer-term averaging periods for air pollutants.\nTwo sensitivity analyses are also presented. First, to explore the impact of our approach to handling outliers we constructed models using a) the original distribution of values and b) excluding those that were less than or equal to the first percentile. Second, to account for potential selection bias among participants who remained in the study until the end of follow-up (those with repeated A\u03b2 measurements), we ran separate OLS models with baseline and follow-up A\u03b2 as the outcome among only those participants with repeated A\u03b2 measurements (i.e., we did not include those who only had baseline values of A\u03b2).\nAnalyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). MICE was performed using PROC MI/PROC MIANALYZE in SAS, and plots were generated using R version 4.0.4 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

CSF samples were collected from 32 SCD patients, 66 MCI patients, and 34 AD patients. After collection, the CSF sample was immediately centrifuged and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until testing. CSF biomarkers were measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) analyzer LUMIPULSE G600 (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan). Cut-off values for CSF were determined by following Fujirebio guidelines and normal values were: A\u03b242> 670 pg/mL, A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio > 0.062, t\u2010tau < 400 pg/mL and p\u2010tau\u00a0< 60 pg/mL.\nAccording to the ATN system and considering only the CSF analysis, we classified patients as: A+ = CSF amyloid biomarkers (A\u03b242, A\u03b242/A\u03b240) lower than the cut-off values; A- = normal values of CSF amyloid biomarkers; T+ = CSF p-tau higher than the cut-off value; T- = CSF p-tau lower than the cut-off value; N+ = CSF t-tau higher than the cut-off value; N- = normal value of CSF t-tau.

Plasma analysis was performed on the automated Single molecule assay (Simoa) SR-X platform (Quanterix corp.). For GFAP and NfL measurement, the Simoa Human Neurology 2-Plex B assay (N2PB) (Item 103520) was used. The assay range of GFAP was 0 - ~40000 pg/mL, instead of NfL was 0 - ~2000 pg/mL.

The ADNI cohort was launched in 2003 as part of a public\u2013private partnership, with Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD, overseeing the project. Approval for the ADNI study was granted by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their authorized representatives.\nParticipants and grouping situation\nThe comprehensive enrollment process and inclusion criteria for various diagnostic categories within the ADNI cohort have been previously documented. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) age > 55 years; (2) initial diagnosis of CN and MCI with a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of either 0 or 0.5; (3) a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS\u201015) score < 6; (4) availability of blood pressure (BP) data at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years; (5) availability of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuropsychological assessments, and pNfL data at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years; (6) baseline availability of AD\u2010related CSF biomarkers. Exclusion criteria were applied as follows: (1) the usage of any psychoactive medications, (2) a diagnosis of dementia, (3) markedly elevated pNfL levels\u00a0>\u00a0179 pg/mL to exclude conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and others. \nAccording to the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association criteria, A\u03b2 positivity can be defined as the AD continuum. For this study, A\u03b2 positivity was defined as A\u03b242\u00a0<\u00a0977 pg/mL, while A\u03b2 negativity was defined as A\u03b242 \u2265 977 pg/mL, aligning with established standards. Following the criteria established by Cedres et\u00a0al., a high WMH burden was characterized by WMH volume adjusted total intracranial volume values > 0.00321, while a low WMH burden was defined as adjusted WMH volume \u2264 0.00321. We use A\u03b2 positivity status to represent the presence of AD pathology and a high WMH burden to signify the presence of CSVD pathology. We compared the differences in BPV and pNfL among different disease groups. The disease groups were defined as follows: A\u03b2\u2010negative individuals with low WMH burden were categorized as A\u03b2\u2212WMH\u2212 (controls), A\u03b2\u2010negative individuals with high WMH burden were categorized as A\u03b2\u2212WMH+, A\u03b2\u2010positive individuals with low WMH burden were categorized as A\u03b2+WMH\u2212, and A\u03b2\u2010positive individuals with high WMH burden were categorized as A\u03b2+WMH+, indicating the comorbidity of AD and CSVD.\nNeuropsychological assessments\nCertified raters conducted the neuropsychological assessments following standardized ADNI protocols (www.adni\u2010info.org). Various scales were used to evaluate cognition, including CDR, Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), memory composite score, and executive composite score. Neuropsychological assessment data at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years were obtained from the ADNI file (\u201cMMSE.csv,\u201d \u201cMOCA.csv,\u201d \u201cCDR.csv,\u201d \u201cUWNPSYCHSUM.csv\u201d).\nRESEARCH IN CONTEX\n Systematic review: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) often co\u2010occur in the aging population, yet the underlying mechanisms linking the two remain ambiguous. Studies have revealed associations of long\u2010term blood pressure variability (BPV) and plasma neurofilament light (pNfL) with AD and CSVD, indicating a potential association between BPV, pNfL, and the comorbidity of AD and CSVD. However, the relationship between BPV, pNfL, and their association with comorbidity remains unexplored.\n Interpretation: Analyses revealed that elevated BPV was associated with pNfL, hippocampal atrophy, white matter hyperintensity progression, and poorer cognition. Moreover, pNfL mediated the effect of BPV on brain structure and cognitive function. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential role of BPV in the mechanisms of comorbidity between AD and CSVD, suggesting that a common risk factor may contribute to the brain pathology associated with both conditions.\n Future directions: It will be necessary to validate the relationship between BPV and pNfL or other axonal injury markers in the prodromal stages of AD. Furthermore, longitudinal tracking and assessment are needed to evaluate the relationship between BPV and the comorbidity of AD and CSVD.\nNeuroimaging data\nMRI examinations adhered to the ADNI MRI scanning protocol. Four brain tissue (gray matter [including hippocampus], white matter, CSF, and WMH) segmentation methods have been described previously; a thorough description can be found in the ADNI reference documentation \u201cFour Tissue Segmentation in ADNI II.\u201d Brain volume data (including hippocampal and WMH volumes [mL]) at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years were extracted from the ADNI file (\u201cADNI_UCD_WMH.csv\u201d).\u2003 \npNfL data and AD\u2010related CSF biomarkers\npNfL analysis was conducted using the single molecule array (Simoa) technique at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, M\u00f6lndal Campus, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden (detailed information available elsewhere: http://adni.loni.usc.edu). CSF samples were collected through lumbar puncture to assess A\u03b242, phosphorylated tau (p\u2010tau)181, and total tau concentrations. CSF samples were analyzed using the Roche automated immunoassay platform (Cobas e601) and immunoassay reagents at the University of Pennsylvania. The pNfL data at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years were obtained from the ADNI file (\u201cADNI_BLENNOWPLASMANFLLONG.csv\u201d). AD\u2010related CSF biomarkers at baseline and 2 years were retrieved from the ADNI file (\u201cUPENNBIOMK_MASTER.csv\u201d).\nBP and BPV assessments\nSeated brachial artery systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were taken from participants at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, following a standardized ADNI protocol described elsewhere (www.adni\u2010info.org). We calculated the average BP and BPV index, including standard deviation (SD) and variation independent of mean (VIM). VIM is a widely used index for long\u2010term BPV, computed using the formula VIM\u00a0=\u00a0SD/meanx, where x is calculated using a fitting function. The average BP and BPV of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were computed. In this study, we mainly used VIM for BPV analysis.\nOther assessments and data collection\nThe following data were gathered from the clinical evaluation file (\u201cADNIMERGE.csv,\u201d \u201cRECMHIST.csv,\u201d \u201cVITALS.csv\u201d): years of education, current smoking status, height, weight, usage of anti\u2010dementia and anti\u2010hypertensive medications, and the presence of vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation. The general Framingham Heart Study (FHS) score was calculated to assess vascular risk. The general FHS score comprises a weighted sum of sex, age, total lipoprotein cholesterol, high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, SBP, treatment for hypertension, current smoking status, and diabetes mellitus status. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 genotype information was extracted from the ADNI file (\u201cAPOERES.csv\u201d). Participants possessing at least one copy of the APOE \u03b54 allele were categorized as APOE \u03b54 carriers.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using R Programming (version 4.2.2). Statistical significance was set at a two\u2010tailed P\u00a0<\u00a00.05.\nContinuous variables not conforming to a normal distribution underwent transformations before regression analysis. MMSE and MoCA scores were z transformed, while WMH volume, pNfL, CSF A\u03b242, p\u2010tau181, and total tau levels were log transformed. One\u2010way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction addressed multiple comparisons for normally distributed data. The chi\u2010square test was used to compare categorical variables, whereas the Kruskal\u2013Wallis with Bonferroni correction was applied to handle multiple comparisons for non\u2013normally distributed continuous variables. The differences in average BP, BPV, baseline biomarkers, and baseline cognitive performance among different groups were compared. As there were variations in age and sex distribution across different groups, a multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to adjust for these factors and calculate the adjusted differences in the indicators among these groups.\nTo explore the relationship between BPV and pNfL, BPV indexes were categorized into tertiles. The differences in pNfL levels among different BPV tertile groups were compared. P values were computed using a multivariate linear model, adjusting for FHS score, APOE \u03b54 status, cognitive status, A\u03b2 status, anti\u2010hypertensive treatments, and average BP. The longitudinal relationship between BPV and pNfL, adjusted for the aforementioned confounding factors, was assessed using a linear mixed\u2010effects model. Random effects included participant\u2010specific intercepts, while fixed effects incorporated the main effects of BPV, with adjustments for previously mentioned confounding variables. The analysis also examined the longitudinal relationship between BPV or pNfL with brain structure (including hippocampal and WMH volumes) and cognitive performance using the same modeling approach.\u2003 \nCausal mediation analyses were used to investigate whether the associations between BPV and brain structural changes and cognition at 2 years were mediated by pNfL. According to the approach proposed by Baron and Kenny, the following criteria need to be met simultaneously to establish the mediation effect: (1) significant association between BPV and pNfL, (2) significant association between BPV and brain structural changes and cognition, (3) significant association between pNfL and brain structural changes and cognition, (4) weakening of the associations between BPV and brain structural changes and cognition when pNfL (mediator) was included in the regression model. Furthermore, chain mediation analyses were used to investigate whether the association between BPV and cognition at 2 years was mediated by pNfL and brain structural changes. The extent of attenuation or indirect effect was estimated, and significance was determined using 1000 bootstrapped iterations with the \u201cmediate\u201d and \u201cbruceR\u201d package. Each path of the model was adjusted for the aforementioned confounding factors."}, "openai_response": "No"}, "PMC10729487": {"class": 1, "title": "Advanced structural brain aging in preclinical autosomal dominant Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "summary": {"Abstract": "Background\n\u201cBrain-predicted age\u201d estimates biological age from complex, nonlinear features in neuroimaging scans. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD), but is underexplored in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), in which AD progression is highly predictable with minimal confounding age-related co-pathology.\nMethods\nWe modeled BAG in 257 deeply-phenotyped ADAD mutation-carriers and 179 non-carriers from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network using minimally-processed structural MRI scans. We then tested whether BAG differed as a function of mutation and cognitive status, or estimated years until symptom onset, and whether it was associated with established markers of amyloid (PiB PET, CSF amyloid-\u03b2-42/40), phosphorylated tau (CSF and plasma pTau-181), neurodegeneration (CSF and plasma neurofilament-light-chain [NfL]), and cognition (global neuropsychological composite and CDR-sum of boxes). We compared BAG to other MRI measures, and examined heterogeneity in BAG as a function of ADAD mutation variants, APOE\u00a0\u03b54 carrier status, sex, and education.\nResults\nAdvanced brain aging was observed in mutation-carriers approximately 7 years before expected symptom onset, in line with other established structural indicators of atrophy. BAG was moderately associated with amyloid PET and strongly associated with pTau-181, NfL, and cognition in mutation-carriers. Mutation variants, sex, and years of education contributed to variability in BAG.\nConclusions\nWe extend prior work using BAG from sporadic AD to ADAD, noting consistent results. BAG associates well with markers of pTau, neurodegeneration, and cognition, but to a lesser extent, amyloid, in ADAD. BAG may capture similar signal to established MRI measures. However, BAG offers unique benefits in simplicity of data processing and interpretation. Thus, results in this unique ADAD cohort with few age-related confounds suggest that brain aging attributable to AD neuropathology can be accurately quantified from minimally-processed MRI.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13024-023-00688-3.", "Method": "Methods\nParticipants\nThe sample included 436 participants from the DIAN Observational Study (data release 16). 257 participants were identified as mutation-carriers (MCs) of pathologic variants in presenilin-1 (PSEN1), presenilin-2 (PSEN2), or amyloid precursor protein (APP). PSEN1 mutation-carriers were further grouped based on the location of the underlying variant (i.e., before or after codon 200). The remaining 179 participants were non-carrier controls (NCs), recruited from the same families as the MCs. In order to characterize and correct for differences in brain age estimates between different sites and scanners, we included data only from DIAN sites with at least 5 eligible participants with a usable T1 MRI scan. For details on each site-specific sample, see Supplementary Table\u00a01.\nEstimated years until symptom onset (EYO) was computed for each participant as the difference between the participant\u2019s chronological age and the mean age of symptom onset for their specific mutation, as determined by a database of known mutation onsets, or the familial age of symptom onset, as determined by semistructured interview. Thus, negative EYO values reflect years until expected onset, whereas positive values reflect years after onset.\nCognitive status was determined using the Clinical Dementia Rating\u00ae (CDR\u00ae) scale. A CDR of 0 defines cognitive normality, while scores above 0 define increasing stages of dementia severity. MCs with CDR\u2009=\u20090 were identified as \u201casymptomatic\u201d, while MCs with CDR\u2009>\u20090 were identified as \u201csymptomatic\u201d. APOE \u03b54 status was dichotomized in all participants between \u03b54 carriers (\u03b54+, including heterozygotes and homozygotes) and \u03b54 non-carriers (\u03b54-).\nDIAN participants provided informed consent in accordance with the local institutional review boards of each participating site. DIAN study procedures have received ethics approval by the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University in St. Louis (MO, USA) and all of the participating sites.\nPET & biofluid biomarkers\nAmyloid \u03b2 plaque deposition was assessed using a [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET tracer. PET data were analyzed from a 30-minute acquisition window beginning 40\u00a0min after a bolus injection of approximately 15 mCi of PiB. All PiB PET scans were processed with the PET Unified Pipeline (PUP), including conventional processing steps and partial volume correction with a regional spread function (RSF). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) summarized PiB tracer binding in previously-defined summary regions, including bilateral precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus, and lateral temporal regions, using the cerebellum as a reference region.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected via lumbar puncture under fasting conditions. CSF amyloid \u03b242 (A\u03b242), amyloid \u03b240 (A\u03b240), and phosphorylated tau-181 (pTau) were measured with Lumipulse immunoassays (Fujirebio). A\u03b242 and pTau estimates were normalized for individual differences in CSF production rates by forming a ratio with A\u03b240 as the denominator. Neurofilament-light-chain (NfL) was measured with a Simoa HD-X platform (Quanterix).\nBlood samples were collected via venipuncture under fasting conditions. Plasma pTau and NfL were measured on a Simoa HD-X platform (Quanterix).\nCognitive battery\nParticipants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. We formed a global cognitive composite by standardizing and combining the Logical Memory delayed recall score, Digit Symbol Substitution total score, Animal Naming fluency score, and time to complete Trail Making part B.\nWe also used the CDR-Sum of Boxes as an additional measure of global dementia severity.\nMRI acquisition & processing\nStructural MRI scans were acquired on a 3T scanner using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE; echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20092.95 ms, repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20092300 ms, inversion time [TI]\u2009=\u2009900 ms, field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009270\u00a0mm, flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, 225 slices, 1.1\u2009\u00d7\u20091.1\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2 mm3 voxels). Scanner manufacturer and model varied between DIAN sites. T1-weighted images were processed using a common minimal pipeline including brain extraction and linear registration to the MNI 152 atlas template.\nT1-weighted images were also processed with FreeSurfer 5.3. For comparison with BAG, additional analyses examined structural estimates in a priori regions of interest, including hippocampus volume, precuneus thickness, and cortical thickness in AD-specific signature regions.\nBrain age modeling\nDeepBrainNet (DBN) is a publicly available 2D convolutional neural network using the inception-resnet-v2 framework, which has previously been trained to predict age on 11,729 MRI scans from independent samples. Briefly, minimally-processed whole-brain T1-weighted images were each represented as a collection of 80 evenly spaced axial slices, which matched the slice positioning of the original DBN training set. For each participant, each of the 80 slices were provided to DBN as independent inputs. A predicted age was generated for each slice with the median output serving as the participant\u2019s final age prediction.\nTo correct for regression dilution in the age prediction model (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), we applied a linear transformation to predicted age values, adjusting for the slope and intercept from a regression model of predicted age as a function of chronological age in NCs. BAG was then calculated as the difference between corrected brain age and chronological age and this corrected value was used for statistical tests of group differences and associations with other variables. However, to avoid inflating estimates of prediction accuracy, only uncorrected age prediction values were used to evaluate model performance.\nStatistical harmonization\nSince MRI scans were collected across several DIAN sites, using a variety of scanner models, these differences might contribute non-biological variance to the brain age signal. Indeed, a Kruskall-Wallis test revealed that BAG values differed between NCs tested at different DIAN sites, \u03c72 (14)\u2009=\u200927.72, p\u2009=\u20090.015, and on different scanner models, \u03c72 (8)\u2009=\u200915.88, p\u2009=\u20090.044 (see Supplementary Figs.\u00a02 and\u00a03). Although these differences were relatively small and limited to only a few specific sites and scanners, they violated our assumption that BAG values should be centered near 0 in NCs, regardless of the site or scanner of acquisition, and had the potential to introduce unwanted noise or confound into the brain age signal.\nHence, we harmonized brain-predicted age values between sites using ComBat. We included age, sex, education, ADAD group, EYO, APOE \u03b54 status, and mutation variant as covariates during harmonization to preserve variance in BAG related to these variables of interest. Critically, after harmonization with ComBat, there were no significant differences in BAG values between sites, \u03c72 (14)\u2009=\u200911.70, p\u2009=\u20090.63, or scanners, \u03c72 (8)\u2009=\u20095.11, p\u2009=\u20090.75 (see Supplementary Figs.\u00a02 and\u00a03).\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted in R 4.2.2 (R Core Team). Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were tested, respectively, by evaluating quantile-quantile plots and with Levene\u2019s test. Mutation group differences in demographic and descriptive variables between NCs and all MCs were tested with Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 (for cell counts\u2009\u2265\u20095) or Fisher\u2019s exact test (for cell counts\u2009<\u20095) for categorical variables. DBN prediction accuracy was evaluated by calculating Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) between predicted age and true chronological age in NCs only. Test-retest reliability of MRI measures was assessed in a subset of 182 participants who had longitudinal MRI data available. See Supplementary Table\u00a02 for a summary of these participants at the baseline visit. There was an average of 2.11 years (SD\u2009=\u20091.21) between longitudinal scans. Specifically, we used the \u2018irr\u2019 package to calculate the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using a 2-way mixed-effects model based on a single measurement and absolute agreement.\nMutation group differences in BAG between NCs, asymptomatic MCs, and symptomatic MCs were tested with an omnibus Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, and were followed up with post hoc Wilcoxon tests using a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.\nAs non-linear trajectories in AD biomarkers have been well established in ADAD, we modeled age-corrected BAG and other MRI measures as a function of EYO using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), similar to an approach previously applied in both ADAD and Down syndrome. Specifically, we used the \u2018mgcv\u2019 package to fit GAMMs with a restricted maximum likelihood method. GAMMs included spline terms for EYO with 4 cubic basis functions to account for non-linearity and an interaction term for mutation status. GAMMs also included categorical and linear terms for covariates, including sex, education, and APOE \u03b54 positivity. All GAMMs included a random effect term to account for familial relationships between MCs and NCs. Simultaneous 83.4% confidence intervals for comparison of two groups were derived for GAMM fits using a simulation-based method and were used to identify the earliest points (EYO) of significant differences between MCs and NCs. We tested for differences in the point of ADAD divergence between different MRI measures using a bootstrapping analysis in 10,000 randomly resampled simulations of the full dataset.\nContinuous relationships between BAG and estimates of amyloid, pTau, neurodegeneration, and cognition were tested using linear mixed effects models (LMEs). LMEs included a fixed term for each biomarker of interest and a group by biomarker interaction term, as well as covariates, including sex, education, and APOE \u03b54 positivity, and a random effect term for familial relationships. Significant group by biomarker interactions were followed-up with Pearson correlation analyses within specific subgroups. As an additional sensitivity analysis to correct for skewed distributions in the biomarker values, we also repeated the biomarker association analyses after applying a log transformation. To further characterize the complex relationships between cognition and AD progression, we tested whether BAG mediated associations between AD biomarkers and the global cognitive composite, using a non-parametric bootstrap method.\nData & code availability\nThis study utilized datasets obtained from the DIAN Observational Study (Data Freeze 16).

However, further research is warranted to explore the exact association of lipoproteins and other metabolites with AD core biomarkers and pathology.", "Method": "2. Methods\n2.1. Data and Participants\nThe data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the US Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Further information about ADNI can be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for ADNI participants are detailed at http://adni.loni.usc.edu. Briefly, all participants included in the ADNI database were from 55 to 90 years old, had 6 years or more of education, spoke English or Spanish fluently, and were without any severe neurological diseases except AD. In ADNI, participants were classified as cognitively normal (CN), MCI, or AD based on criteria comprehensively discussed on the ADNI website. The AD group met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for AD.\nIn this study, we included all patients with AD diagnosis for whom data including demographics, Apo-E gene status, cognitive assessments (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)), CSF AD-related proteins (A\u03b2-42, TAU, and P-TAU), lipoproteins and metabolites data were available. Eventually, our study consisted of 221 AD subjects among whom 71 subjects were Apo-E \u03b54 negative and 150 subjects were Apo-E \u03b54 positive.\n2.2. Lipoproteins and Metabolites\nIn this study, lipoproteins and metabolites data were extracted from the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of human serum samples from the ADNI using the Nightingale Health platform, which is available in the ADNI database. Nightingale Health has developed an NMR-based blood biomarker analysis assay, quantifying over 220 metabolic biomarkers from a single blood sample. NMR and mass spectrometry have become key technologies in the metabolomics field. However, Nightingale's NMR platform has an advantage when compared to mass spectrometry approaches as it provides absolute concentrations of metabolic measures, rather than relative concentrations, which increases the interpretability of the biomarker data provided. Additional information regarding sample preparation and processing is available in detail at http://adni.loni.usc.edu.\nIn this study, data regarding lipoproteins, FAs, and various low-molecular metabolites including amino acids, ketone bodies, and gluconeogenesis-related metabolites, which were available in Nightingale's NMR analysis, were included. All included lipoproteins and metabolites are described in Supplementary Table 1. Briefly, 14 subclasses of lipoproteins, two apolipoproteins, 10 FAs, five glycolysis-related metabolites, nine amino acids, three ketone bodies, and two fluid balance metabolites (creatinine and albumin) were included in the final analysis.\n2.3. CSF A\u03b2-42, TAU, and P-TAU\nCSF A\u03b2-42, TAU, and P-TAU extracted from ADNI were analyzed by the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) Elecsys which is currently under development by Roche Diagnostics and not commercially available yet. Roche Elecsys is a validated and fully automated immunoassay, which is utilized in conducting in vitro tests for the quantitative determination of the concentration of the mentioned proteins in human CSF. A detailed description of the biomarkers assessments is available on ADNI.\n2.4. Statistical Analysis\nContinuous variables were reported as mean \u00b1 standard\u2009deviation\u2009(SD) and compared between negative and positive Apo-E4 groups using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test or independent-sample t-test based on the distribution of the data. Gender was compared between two groups using Pearson's chi-square test. To test the correlation between the levels of CSF A-\u03b2, TAU, and P-TAU and lipoproteins and metabolites, partial correlation tests adjusted for age and gender were performed in each negative and positive Apo-E4 group. All statistical analyses were also performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Armonk, New York, USA) and a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant."}, "openai_response": "Yes"}, "PMC10472051": {"class": 1, "title": "A leaky gut contributes to postural dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "summary": {"Abstract": "Background\nPostural dysfunction is a common problem in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may lead to functional dependency and increasing morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology of postural dysfunction in AD patients remains poorly understood.\nObjectives\nElevated intestinal permeability is an underlying contributor to multiple diseases, including AD. We aimed to investigate the association of elevated intestinal permeability with postural dysfunction in AD patients.\nDesign Setting, Participants, Measurements\nWe conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on older adults, including controls and AD patients. We investigated the associations of postural balance with plasma zonulin, a marker of elevated intestinal permeability in geriatric controls (n\u00a0=\u00a074) and patients with mild (n\u00a0=\u00a071) and moderate (n\u00a0=\u00a066) AD. We used a standardized physical performance battery to measure balance in supine, tandem, and semi-tandem positions. We also measured handgrip strength (HGS), and gait speed as markers of physical capacity.\nResults\nAD patients exhibited lower balance scores, HGS, and gait speed and higher plasma zonulin than in controls (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Plasma zonulin levels demonstrated significant areas under the curves in diagnosing poor balance in AD patients (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moderate AD was associated with lower balance and physical capacity, and higher zonulin than mild AD (ALL P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Poor scores on balance scale were associated with higher expressions of markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and muscle damage providing a mechanistic link between increased intestinal permeability and postural dysfunction in AD patients.\nConclusion\nThe results of our study show that plasma zonulin measurement may be used to diagnose postural dysfunction in AD patients. The study is relevant to non-ambulant and/or comatose AD patients with postural dysfunction. Our findings also highlight the therapeutic potential of repairing the intestinal leak to improve postural control and reduce the risk of falls in AD patients.\nGraphical abstract", "Method": "Materials and methods\nStudy design & participant\nWe recruited controls (n\u00a0=\u00a074) and patients with AD (n\u00a0=\u00a0137) at the Department of Neurology and Stroke Medicine, Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan, after obtaining written informed consent. The diagnosis of AD was based on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, and the patients were divided into mild (MMSE score\u00a0=\u00a021\u201325, n\u00a0=\u00a071) and moderate (MMSE score\u00a0=\u00a010\u201320, p\u00a0=\u00a066) AD, as described by us previously. The recruitment criteria of participants are previously described by us in detail. Briefly, patients with recent hospitalization, joint diseases, major organ failure, and recent surgeries were excluded. The study includes Caucasian men, and ethics approval was obtained from the hospital ethics committee before data collection. This study was conducted under the declaration of Helsinki.\nHGS and body composition\nHGS was measured using a digital handgrip dynamometer (CAMRY, South El Monte, CA, USA), as described elsewhere by us. We used a bioelectrical impedance analysis scale (RENPHO, Dubai, UAE) to measure body composition, including fast mass, skeletal muscle mass (SMM), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and phase angle, as described elsewhere by us.\nMeasurement of physical capacity\nWe measured standing balance using a physical performance tool. Briefly, the participants were asked to stand unassisted without the help of a stick or walker. The balance for side-by-side, semi-tandem, and fully tandem standing was measured with a timer for 10\u00a0s or unless the participants moved. We used timed quartiles to assign the scores ranging from zero (worst performance) to four (maximal performance), as described elsewhere in detail. We used a smartwatch pedometer to measure the daily step count, and the mean values from the daily counts of the past four weeks were reported, as described previously by us.\nMeasurement of circulating biomarkers\nThe blood samples were collected in morning hours following an overnight fast, centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min, and plasma was stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for further analysis, as described previously. We used an ELISA kit to measure plasma zonulin (Cat #K5601, Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used ELISA kits to measure plasma c-reactive proteins (CRP) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), 8\u2013isoprostanes (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and creatine kinase, as described previously.\nStatistical analysis\nA one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc test was used to compare the differences among the groups. We used simple linear regression to investigate the correlations of plasma zonulin with CRP, 8-isoprostanes, and creatine kinase.

There is a need for new Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) treatments globally. Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated soluble amyloid beta oligomers and insoluble amyloid beta fibrils. In June 2021, aducanumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AD under the accelerated approval pathway.\nObjectives\nWe evaluated the efficacy, safety, biomarker and pharmacokinetics (PK) of aducanumab in Japanese subgroups in EMERGE and ENGAGE studies.\nDesign\nEMERGE and ENGAGE were two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, phase 3 studies of aducanumab in patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia).\nSetting\nThese studies involved 348 sites in 20 countries. PARTICIPANTS: Participants enrolled in Japan included 121 (7.4% of total 1638 in EMERGE) and 100 (6.1% of total 1647 in ENGAGE) patients (aged 50\u201385 years with confirmed amyloid pathology) who met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia.\nIntervention\nParticipants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive aducanumab low dose (3 or 6 mg/kg target dose), high dose (6 or 10 mg/kg target dose) or placebo via IV infusion once every 4 weeks over 76 weeks.\nMeasurements\nThe primary outcome measure was change from baseline to Week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), an integrated scale that assesses both function and cognition. Other measures included safety assessments; secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes that assessed cognition, function, and behavior; biomarker endpoints (amyloid PET and plasma p-tau181); serum PK profiles and immunogenicity.\nResults\nResults from the Japanese subgroup analyses were generally consistent with those of the overall study population across endpoints, while a lower mean body weight (kg) and a smaller proportion of ApoE \u03b54 carriers were observed in the Japanese subgroup population. A treatment effect was observed in favor of aducanumab on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 78 in EMERGE, but not ENGAGE. The incidence and type of adverse events in the Japanese subgroups were generally comparable to those observed in the overall study population; amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were common treatment-related adverse events that appeared to be related to the aducanumab dose. ARIA incidence was generally lower in the Japanese subgroup compared with the overall population. Consistent with the overall data set, a robust dose-dependent decrease in amyloid beta levels as assessed with amyloid-PET and plasma p-tau181 was observed. Serum PK profiles and immunogenicity of aducanumab in Japanese population were consistent with the non-Japanese population.\nConclusion\nEfficacy, safety, biomarker, and PK profiles of aducanumab were consistent between the Japanese subgroup and the overall population. A positive treatment effect of aducanumab on efficacy endpoints was observed in EMERGE, but not in ENGAGE.\nElectronic Supplementary Material\nSupplementary material is available in the online version of this article at 10.14283/jpad.2024.106.", "Method": "Methods\nParticipants\nInclusion criteria for EMERGE and ENGAGE are listed. Briefly, EMERGE and ENGAGE included patients with early AD who 1) met clinical criteria for either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD dementia, 2) were aged 50 to 85 years, 3) had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)-Global score of 0.5, 4) had a Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) delayed memory index score \u226485, and 5) had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 24 and 30 (inclusive). Participants were confirmed to be amyloid positive via amyloid positron emission tomography (PET; central visual read). Participants in Japan were enrolled across 27 sites (EMERGE) and 18 sites (ENGAGE).\nClinical study design\nDetails have been previously published. Briefly, randomization was stratified by study site and by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u03b54 carrier status (carrier vs noncarrier). Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive low-dose aducanumab (3 mg/kg [ApoE \u03b54+] or 6 mg/kg [ApoE \u03b54\u2212]), high-dose aducanumab (6 mg/kg [ApoE \u03b54+] or 10 mg/kg [ApoE \u03b54\u2212]), or placebo via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. The implementation of protocol version 4 (PV4; approved on March 24, 2017) allowed ApoE \u03b54 carriers in the high-dose group to receive 10 mg/kg of aducanumab, which was an increase from 6 mg/kg pre-PV4. The treatment period for the Japanese study sites was from June 9, 2016, to July 31, 2019 (final follow-up visit) in EMERGE and from September 1, 2016, to July 31, 2019 (final follow-up visit) in ENGAGE.\nEfficacy assessments\nThe efficacy outcomes included the primary endpoint (change from baseline in CDR-Sum of Boxes [SB] at Week 78) and secondary endpoints (change from baseline in MMSE, Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale-13 items [ADAS-Cog13], and Activities of Daily Living Inventory-Mild Cognitive Impairment version [ADCS-ADL-MCI] scores at Week 78).\nSafety assessments\nA description of the safety assessments in EMERGE and ENGAGE, including methodology related to the monitoring, analyses, and management of amyloid related imaging abnormality (ARIA), have been reported. Briefly, the safety and tolerability of aducanumab were assessed via (1) monitoring incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); (2) assessing brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (e.g., the incidence of ARIA-edema [E] and ARIA-hemorrhage [H] comprised of microhemorrhages, macrohemorrhages, or superficial siderosis); (3) monitoring clinically significant abnormalities and changes in vital signs, (4) tracking Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale results, and (5) monitoring incidence of anti-aducanumab antibodies in serum throughout the study period.\nBiomarkers, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity\nCerebral amyloid plaque content was measured by amyloid PET imaging for eligibility and as part of a longitudinal biomarker substudy, as previously described. Images were collected at baseline, Week 26 and Week 78. Multiple radioligands for A\u03b2 PET have been approved for the detection of amyloid. Globally, EMERGE and ENGAGE trial sites used the 18F-florbetapir radioligand for substudy imaging, however due to the its limited geographic availability in Japan at the start of the studies, the 18F-flutemetamol radioligand was also included. Both tracers have been approved for the detection of amyloid in Japan. The Centiloid Scale approach was used to transform A\u03b2 PET composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) derived from each PET radioligand to a common scale to enable pooling of results. The formulas used were: 100\u00d7((SUVR-1.0124))/0.4339 for 18F-florbetapir and 100\u00d7((SUVR-0.9593))/0.6170 for 18F-flutemetamol.\nThe effects of aducanumab treatment on plasma p-tau181 levels were analyzed using the Quanterix Simoa p-tau181 Advantage V2 kit at Frontage Laboratories\u2019 (Exton, PA) CLIA laboratory. Data were captured by the Quanterix Simoa HD-X Analyzer as previously described. Serum PK profiles and immunogenicity of aducanumab were measured throughout the study using a validated assay.\nOversight\nEMERGE and ENGAGE were carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and the International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guideline (ICH-GCP). The studies were approved by ethics committees or institutional review boards at each participating site in Japan. All patients provided written informed consent. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed ongoing safety and tolerability data throughout the course of the studies and reviewed futility analysis results.\nStatistical analyses\nPrimary analyses on the primary, secondary, and amyloid PET endpoints for the Japanese subgroup were performed following the same prespecified mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) used for the overall population, except for the exclusion of region as a covariate. Forest plots of the efficacy results were presented to evaluate the consistency of the Japanese efficacy results with those of the overall population. Incidence was calculated by treatment group for AEs and SAEs in the Japanese subgroup. The statistical software, SAS\u00ae, was used for all summaries and analyses.\nAvailability of data and materials\nWhile the data described in this article are not publicly available, the authors and Biogen are supportive of data sharing.

Few studies have examined the role of sex in plasma biomarkers in sporadic AD, yielding mixed findings, and none in autosomal dominant AD.\nMETHODS.\nWe examined the effects of sex and age on plasma P-tau217 and NfL, and their association with cognitive performance in a cross-sectional study of 621 Presenilin-1 E280A mutation carriers and non-carriers.\nRESULTS.\nAs plasma P-tau217 levels increase, cognitively unimpaired female carriers showed better cognitive performance than cognitively unimpaired male carriers. Yet, as disease progresses, female carriers had a greater plasma NfL increase than male carriers. There were no sex differences in the association between age and plasma biomarkers among non-carriers.\nDISCUSSION.\nOur findings suggest that, among PSEN1 mutation carriers, females had a greater rate of neurodegeneration than males, yet it did not predict cognitive performance.", "Method": "Methods\nParticipants & Procedures\nA total of 621 participants were included in the study, including 259 cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers (mean age: 31, range 24-39; %male: 45.6), 106 cognitively impaired mutation carriers (mean age: 49, range 46-52; %male: 45.3), and 256 age- and sex-matched, cognitively unimpaired non-carriers from the same kindred (mean age: 34, range 25.3-42; %male: 39.5) who were enrolled from December 2013 to February 2017 in the Colombian Alzheimer Prevention Initiative (API) Registry. In brief, this registry aims to locate, enroll, genotype, and perform medical and cognitive evaluations of PSEN1 E280A family members, and includes individuals with early-onset, potentially familial AD and healthy relatives, age 8 and older. Only those who were 18 years old or above were included in the present study.\nNearly all PSEN1 mutation carriers develop early-onset AD, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) symptoms emerging at a median age of 44 years and dementia at 49 years. Participants were considered cognitively unimpaired if they had a MMSE score \u226526 points, a functional assessment staging test (FAST) score \u22642, and no cognitive impairment on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (CERAD) battery. Cognitive impairment was defined as a FAST score of \u22653 or MCI or dementia due to AD. Clinical diagnoses were determined by an interdisciplinary team of dementia specialists (i.e., neurologists, neuropsychologists). Individuals with significant medical, psychiatric, or neurological disorders were excluded. Participants in the study reported their sex assigned at birth (i.e., male/female).\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Antioquia, Colombia, including procedures undertaken outside the University of Antioquia. Informed written consent for participation and the use of data and samples was obtained from cognitively unimpaired adult participants, or from a legal representative (i.e., partner or offspring) of cognitively impaired participants. Participants included a representative sample from the region of Antioquia, Colombia. Participants were not excluded in the basis of sex, gender, race or ethnicity. Participants and investigators acquiring and analyzing data were blind to genetic status. All participants completed clinical and cognitive assessments, and blood samples were collected within 6 months of cognitive evaluations as part of the registry procedures.\nPlasma Sampling\nPlasma was collected in the morning (without fasting) at the University of Antioquia. Three aliquots of 1 mL were collected. Samples were centrifuged, stored at \u221280\u00b0C and shipped on dry ice for analysis. Plasma NfL concentration was measured at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, using the NF-Light kit on a Single molecule array (Simoa) HD-X Analyzer (Quanterix, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, as previously described. Measurements were done by board-certified laboratory technicians. Calibrators were run in duplicates, and obvious outlier calibrator replicates were masked before curve fitting. Samples were diluted four-fold and run in singlicates. All measurements were made without information on any clinical data. The dynamic range of the assay was 1.9\u20131800 pg/mL. Two QC plasma samples were run in duplicates in the beginning and the end of each run. For the QC sample with a concentration of 10.8 pg/mL, repeatability was 4.8% and intermediate precision 6.2%, while for the QC sample with a concentration of 47.7 pg/mL, repeatability was 3.3% and intermediate precision 4.6%. One batch of reagents and one instrument was used to analyze all samples.\nFor P-tau217, concentrations of plasma P-tau217 were measured using immunoassays at Lilly Research Laboratories, using the MSD platform (Meso Scale Discovery), as previously described. Biotinylated-IBA493 was used as a capture antibody and SULFO-TAG-4G10-E2 (anti-Tau) as the detector. The assay was calibrated using a recombinant tau (4R2N) protein that was phosphorylated in vitro using a reaction with glycogen synthase kinase-3 and characterized by mass spectrometry. Additional details of the plasma P-tau217 analysis are described in Palmqvist et al., 2020, Supplemental Material. Plasma samples from study participants were analyzed in duplicates with a mean intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of 13.9%. The mean inter-assay CVs of quality control samples were 3.4-5.5%. The lower limit of detection of the plasma P-tau217 assay was 0.48 pg/mL.\nFor genetic analyses, genomic DNA was extracted from blood by standard protocols, and PSEN1 E280A characterization was done at the University of Antioquia using methods described previously. NfL analyses were supervised by co-authors Zetterberg and Blennow at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital (Sweden), and P-tau217 analyses by co-author Dage at Lilly Research Laboratories (USA).\nClinical & Cognitive Assessments\nClinical and cognitive assessments were undertaken at the University of Antioquia (Medell\u00edn, Colombia). Participants completed a battery of clinical and cognitive measures in Spanish, adapted by the Neurosciences Group of Antioquia (GNA) to characterize this Colombian population, including the MMSE, the Spanish CERAD battery, the Functional Assessment Staging Test, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Testing was done in Spanish by neuropsychologists or psychologists trained in neuropsychological assessment. We calculated the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative (API) global cognition composite score, which includes the MMSE (Orientation to Time), Boston Naming Test (15-item), Ravens Progressive Matrices (12-item), CERAD Word List (Delayed Recall), and Constructional Praxis (Copy). This cognitive composite score has been shown to track preclinical AD decline in autosomal dominant AD. Clinical histories and neurological examinations were completed by neurologists or physicians trained in assessing neurodegenerative disorders.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe compared demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and cognitive data among males and females stratified by PSEN1 mutation status (i.e., carriers and non-carriers) using t-tests. Because plasma P-tau217 and NfL data were not normally distributed, plasma biomarker data was log transformed. To examine the age-related trajectory of plasma biomarkers, a proxy for disease progression in this kindred, we used multiple linear regression models to estimate the effect of age, sex, and the interaction between sex and age on P-tau217 and NfL levels, stratified by PSEN1 mutation carriers and non-carriers. Bivariate local polynomial regressions (LOESS) were used to characterize relationships between log-transformed plasma P-tau217 and NfL with age. We then used multiple linear regressions to examine whether sex modified the relationship between plasma biomarkers and cognitive performance among PSEN1 carriers. Models included plasma biomarkers \u2013 P-tau217 and NfL \u2013 as the independent variable, cognitive measures \u2013 API cognitive composite score and CERAD word list delayed recall \u2013 as dependent variables, sex as a covariate of interest, and the interaction terms between sex and plasma biomarkers (i.e., Sex*P-tau217 and Sex*NfL). Subsequent models were run controlling for age. To further understand the effect of age, a proxy for disease progression among PSEN1 mutation carriers, secondary analyses were conducted stratifying by disease stage (i.e., cognitively unimpaired carriers and cognitively impaired carriers). Analyses used a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Analyses were performed by a team of biostatisticians who were unblinded to genotype but had no role in the study design or data collection. Statistical analyses were done using R (version 4.0.2, The R Foundation) and SPSS version 24. Of note, a female non-carrier participant had NfL values >2 standard deviations above the non-carrier mean and was removed from the analyses."}, "openai_response": "Yes"}, "PMC11015666": {"class": 1, "title": "Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A in serum is an ideal biomarker for early diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "summary": {"Abstract": "Background\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that early intervention was the best plan to inhibit the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), which relied on the discovery of early diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2\u00a0A (SV2A) was examined to improve the early diagnostic efficiency in AD.\nMethods\nIn this study, biomarker testing was performed through the single-molecule array (Simoa). A total of 121 subjects including cognitively unimpaired controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), AD and other types of dementia underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SV2A testing; 430 subjects including health controls, aMCI, AD and other types of dementia underwent serum SV2A, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) and p-tau217 testing; 92 subjects including aMCI and AD underwent both CSF SV2A and serum SV2A testing; 115 cognitively unimpaired subjects including APOE \u03b54 carriers and APOE \u03b54 non-carriers were tested for serum SV2A, GFAP, NfL and p-tau217. Then, the efficacy of SV2A for the early diagnosis of AD and its ability to identify those at high risk of AD from a cognitively unimpaired population were further analyzed.\nResults\nBoth CSF and serum SV2A significantly and positively correlated with cognitive performance in patients with AD, and their levels gradually decreased with the progression of AD. Serum SV2A demonstrated excellent diagnostic efficacy for aMCI, with a sensitivity of 97.8%, which was significantly higher than those of NfL, GFAP, and p-tau217. The SV2A-positive rates ranged from 92.86 to 100% in aMCI cases that were negative for the above three biomarkers. Importantly, of all the biomarkers tested, serum SV2A had the highest positivity rate (81.82%) in individuals at risk for AD.\nConclusions\nSerum SV2A was demonstrated to be a novel and ideal biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD, which can effectively distinguish those at high risk of AD in cognitively unimpaired populations.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13195-024-01440-9.", "Method": "Methods\nStudy participants\nA total of 757 participants were recruited from September 2021 to February 2024. The diagnoses of AD was made according to the criteria published by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer\u2019s Association (NIA-AA), which combined with brain MRI or/and PET-A\u03b2 or/and PET-tau. aMCI was diagnosed by the criteria as described previously. Briefly, (I) cognitive impairment is detected by the patients themselves, their families, or experienced clinicians; (II) cognitive assessment reveals the presence of impairment in one or more domains of cognitive functioning; (III) complex instrumental daily living of patients can be mildly impaired but independent daily living is maintained; (IV) criteria for the diagnosis of dementia has not been met. VaD and PDD was diagnosed based on previously published criteria. All clinical diagnoses were first time diagnoses and were made by experienced physicians of Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University.\nThe exclusion criteria for the patients was as follows: (I) patients with traumatic brain disorders and other psychiatric disorders; (II) patients with systemic diseases such as tumors, blood diseases, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The inclusion criteria for the healthy controls for blood tests was as follows: (I) age-matched participants who have undergone medical examination at the Health Examination Center of Xuanwu Hospital, and (II) the results of the physical examination confirmed that the participants had no neurological diseases, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and other systemic diseases. The inclusion criteria for the participants in the control group who underwent CSF testing was as follows: (I) participants who were hospitalized for the first time and did not receive systemic therapy, (II) did not have imaging findings of cognitive impairment such as hippocampal atrophy, (III) and at least two neurologists confirmed that they did not have clinical manifestations of cognitive impairment.\nIn total, 59 individuals were excluded, and 698 were finally included in the study. The sera of 430 participants comprising the healthy control (n\u2009=\u2009102), aMCI (n\u2009=\u200991), AD (n\u2009=\u2009164), VaD (n\u2009=\u200943), and PDD (n\u2009=\u200930) groups were investigated. The CSF samples of 121 patients comprising the normal cognition group (n\u2009=\u200935), aMCI (n\u2009=\u200914), AD (n\u2009=\u200946), VaD (n\u2009=\u200913), and PDD (n\u2009=\u200913) were also analyzed. Of these, a total of 8 patients with aMCI and 22 with AD had their CSF and venous blood samples collected simultaneously and then tested for SV2A, and we collected CSF and serum samples from an additional 29 aMCI and 33 AD patients simultaneously for correlation analysis between CSF SV2A and serum SV2A. In addition, the sera of 115 participants with unimpaired cognition, including apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers (n\u2009=\u200955) and non-carriers (n\u2009=\u200960), were examined. The subject inclusion and exclusion process is shown in Fig.\u00a01. No statistically significant difference in age was found between the dementia groups and the control group, and between APOE \u03b54 carriers and APOE \u03b54 non-carriers. The sex ratio of each dementia group matched that of the control group, except for the VaD group that had undergone blood testing. Clinical and demographic features of the diagnostic cohorts are shown in Table\u00a01.\nCSF and serum collection\nCSF samples were immediately collected according to international guidelines. Briefly, the participants were placed in the left lateral position for lumbar puncture. The L3\u2013L5 intervertebral disc spaces were chosen as the puncture site. CSF samples were collected with 20-gauge atraumatic needles and centrifugated at 2000 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min at room temperature.\nBlood samples were drawn by venipuncture in the morning after a 12-h fast and were kept in serum tubes with a clot activator. Sera were extracted from the blood samples by centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min. CSF and serum samples were then stored in polypropylene tubes at \u2212\u200980\u2103 until the next test, avoiding repeated freezing and thawing.\nGenetic analyses\nGenomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples using a salting-out procedure. APOE genotypes were determined by Sanger sequencing, and the primers used were as follows: forward\u2014AGACGCGGGCACGGCTGTCCAAGGA; reverse\u2014AGACGCGGGCACGGCTGTCCAAGGA.\nSimoa assay for CSF and serum analysis\nFor the novel SV2A Simoa assay, a polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing SV2A was used (CSB-PA022978LA01HU, CUSABIO, Wuhan, China) as capture antibody, with identifying sequence of 36-149AA. Another rabbit Anti-SV2A antibody (bs-2407R, BIOSS, Beijing, China) was used as a detection antibody with a recognition site of 451\u2013550. CSF and serum samples were analyzed on the AST-Sc-Lite, a fully-auto single-molecule detection machine (Suzhou AstraBio Technology Co., Ltd., China), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. GFAP and NfL were detected as described in the previously published study. Briefly, the working steps were as follows: (I) load 25 \u00b5L of the sample into an incubation tube and add reagent 1 (mainly comprised of 0.1\u00a0mg/mL magnetic beads coated with capture antibodies and protecting reagents), followed by a quick mixing by the machine. (II) After 6\u00a0min of incubation, reagent 2 (mainly comprised of the detection antibodies labeled with single-molecule imagine fluorophores supplied by AstraBio) was added, mixed, and incubated for 4\u00a0min at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. (III) The magnetic beads in the mixtures were absorbed onto the surface of the channel in the flow cell by a permanent magnet. Unlabeled fluorophores were removed by gentle washing flow of the wash buffer, and fluorescent images were then taken with an integrated fluorescent microscope. (IV) The single-molecule signals were analyzed by the machine, and protein concentrations were calculated using a build standard curve prepared in advance. The standard curves for each biomarker were shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1. The new SV2A simoa assay as well as the GFAP, NfL and p-tau217 simoa assays demonstrated excellent detection performance, and more information was presented in Additional file 1.\nStereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)\nAs for the construction of AAV9-SV2Aoe, the vector HBAAV9-m-3xflag-T2A-mcherry (Hanbio Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was used. 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice prepared for the stereotaxic injection were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50\u00a0mg/kg body weight) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. The AAV9 were bilaterally injected into the dorsal hippocampal area at a rate of 0.2 \u00b5L/min, and the total volumes of AAV-SV2Aoe (1.3\u2009\u00d7\u20091012 vg/mL) and AAV-Con (1.9\u2009\u00d7\u20091012 vg/mL) injected into the unilateral hippocampal region were 1.5 \u00b5L and 1.0 \u00b5L, respectively. The needle was retracted after 10\u00a0min, and the wound was sutured after another 10\u00a0min.\nHistology and immunostaining\n4% paraformaldehyde-fixed mice brain tissues were dehydrated in 30% sucrose and embedded in the optimal cutting temperature compound for frozen sectioning. Antigen retrieval was performed by using citric acid (pH 6.0) antigen repair solution in a sub-boiling temperature. Then sections were immersed in 3% hydrogenperoxide to block the endogenous peroxidase activity followed by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin solution to block non-specific binding. The slides were then incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in a wet box with rabbit anti-6E10 (Cat. No. 803,015, BioLegend, USA, 1:1000). HRP-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Cat. No. GB23303, Servicebio, China, 1:500) were applied for 50\u00a0min at room temperature in dark condition, and antigen was visualized using tyramide signal amplification kits (Cat. No. G1226, Servicebio) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Sections were imaged using a slide scanner (PANNORAMIC, 3D HISTECH, Hungary). Images were then analyzed by Image J software, and the background was subtracted by the software for fluorescence images before quantification. The number and the size of A\u03b2 plaques, and the fluorescence intensity of 6E10 in three brain sections containing the hippocampus and cortex of each mouse were measured.\nELISA\nThe blood of mice was collected into polypropylene tubes by the eyeball blood sampling method, left at room temperature for 2\u00a0h, then centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm/min for 20\u00a0min, and the supernatant was aspirated into new polypropylene tubes and stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. Levels of A\u03b240 (Cat. No. EM0863, FineTest, Wuhan, China) and A\u03b242 (Cat. No. EM0864, FineTest, Wuhan, China) were measured by ELISA following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nStatistical analysis\nThe normality of the distribution of the variables was assessed using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. Continuous variables were compared between two independent samples using the t-test or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and representative optimal sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Cutoff levels were determined by maximizing the Youden index (sensitivity\u2009+\u2009specifcity\u2009\u2212\u20091). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive models, and ROC curves were constructed from the logistic scores. Logistic regression models were employed to compare continuous variables between different groups before and after adjusting for covariates such as age and sex. Partial correlation analyses or Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analyses were performed to assess the correlations between biomarkers, demographic characteristics, and clinical data. The statistical significance of the difference in the areas under the curve (AUCs) between two different models was analyzed using Delong\u2019s test. The parallel test and serial test were used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the combined diagnostic models, respectively.

Trained clinical pharmacists staffed the virtual collaborative care clinic (vCCC) to remotely manage hypertension using a BP dashboard and phone \u201cvisits\u201d to monitor BP, adherence, side effects of medications, and prescribe anti-hypertensives. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension were identified via electronic health records. Enrolled patients were randomized to either vCCC or usual care for 3 months. We assessed patients\u2019 home BP monitoring behaviour, and patients\u2019, physicians\u2019, and pharmacists\u2019 perspectives on feasibility and acceptability of individual programme components.\nResults\nThirty-one patients (vCCC = 17, usual care = 14) from six physician clinics completed the pilot study. After 3 months, average BP decreased in the vCCC arm (P = 0.01), but not in the control arm (P = 0.45). The vCCC participants measured BP more (9.9 vs. 1.2 per week, P < 0.001). There were no intervention-related adverse events. Participating physicians (n = 6), pharmacists (n = 5), and patients (n = 31) rated all programme components with average scores of >4.0, a pre-specified benchmark. Nine adaptations in vCCC design and delivery were made based on potential barriers to implementing the programme and suggestions.\nConclusion\nA home-based virtual hypertension programme using team-based care, technology, and a logical integration of evidence-based strategies is safe, acceptable, and feasible to intended users. These pilot data support studies to assess the effectiveness of this programme at a larger scale.", "Method": "Methods\nWe conducted a pragmatic single-centre pilot study to assess critical implementation outcomes needed to scale up the hypertension programme (NCT04585880). The study was approved by the institutional review board.\nPatient identification and recruitment\nPatients aged \u226565 years with uncontrolled hypertension were enrolled from six PCP clinics for a 3-month duration. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as (i) SBP >140 mmHg at current visit and documented history of hypertension, (ii) SBP >140 mmHg at current visit and at another visit in the last 18 months, or (iii) SBP >160 mmHg at current visit. BP measured at an emergency department, inpatient, or surgical visit was not considered in determining eligibility as these readings are less likely to reflect usual BP control. We chose an age cut-off >65 years as it is the age of Medicare enrolment and several outcomes for the larger study will be obtained from the Medicare data. Moreover, the reduction in cardiovascular events from BP lowering is likely to be more evident in older individuals. Using these criteria our EHR Reporting Workbench (Epic Systems, Verona, WI) identified potentially eligible patients and referred them at the point of care (i.e. in real-time) to the study team for pre-screening and enrolment. We applied broad inclusion criteria to recruit men and women, all racial and ethnic minorities, patients with multiple comorbidities, frailty, mobility limitations, and very old adults who are often excluded from explanatory studies. Patients with illness that could affect the safety or study completion, such as unstable psychiatric disorder, mental retardation, or other reasons that make them unable to sign their own consent, end-stage kidney disease on dialysis, or expected life expectancy <2 years were excluded. The study was designed to be pragmatic (Supplementary Table 1) to allow transition to the real-world clinics. Clinical pharmacists from the PCP team delivered the intervention with flexible protocols. Phone visits reduced patient burden while continuing frequent contact. Potentially eligible patients were identified by the EHR. We used the EHR for initial patient identification. However, since all exclusion criteria couldn\u2019t be done through the EHR, we had study coordinators screen and determine eligibility.\nPotentially eligible patients were contacted within 2 weeks of their primary care visit to determine eligibility. These eligibility criteria included access to a compatible smartphone or other devices, such as IOS, Android, or Amazon Kindle or Fire devices, sufficient fluency in English, adequate vision and hearing to complete study procedures, and interest). Informed consent was obtained remotely.\nIntervention\nAll participants received an FDA-approved electronic BP cuff (QardioArm, Qardio Inc.) and educational material on hypertension in preparation for the baseline visit. During the baseline visit, study coordinators instructed patients on use of the BP cuff and the correct method of BP measurement. After a 5-min rest, three standardized BP measures, 1 min apart were obtained. If a BP reading was different by \u226520 mmHg from other two readings, it was discarded, and a fourth reading was taken to replace it. A symptom checklist and patient surveys were also obtained.\nAfter the baseline visit, participants were randomized to either a control group (usual care with education) or the vCCC group (Supplementary Fig. 1). Randomization was done remotely. The study coordinator randomized the participant in the REDCap database (randomization prepared by the study statisticians) while the participant was still on the phone and provided them with instructions on how to proceed based on the study arm they were randomized to usual care with education or the virtual collaborative care clinic arm.\nVirtual collaborative care clinic\nThe vCCC operated as an extension (not replacement) of care provided by PCPs. Trained, board-certified, or board-eligible ambulatory care clinical pharmacists already working for the health system staffed the vCCC. The vCCC pharmacists managed hypertension. They educated patients on home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), monitored home BP readings, adherence, and medication side effects. They used the EHR to communicate with physicians, order laboratory tests, e-prescribe medications, or make medication changes. To monitor longitudinal home BP readings, vCCC pharmacists used a BP dashboard (Qardio Inc) and a patient portal (Epic MyChart) and/or phone calls to communicate with patients. The BP dashboard used a traffic light system to organize and prioritize uncontrolled BP and individualize BP goals and alerts. The vCCC pharmacists communicated at least once a month with patients and as often as required. If a patient did not check BP regularly, pharmacists contacted the patient to address barriers to adherence.\nFor patients randomized to the vCCC group, the vCCC pharmacist conducted a 15-min introductory phone call, reviewed current medications and BP history, and encouraged regular HBPM (at least 10 times a week, 5 in the morning and 5 in the evening). The control group was not contacted by the vCCC and continued regular follow-up with their physicians.\nThe primary outcomes were programme feasibility and acceptability. Other outcomes included barrier and facilitator identification, safety, frequency of HBPM, and change in BP. Acceptability and feasibility of the programme were evaluated by assessing five programme components: automated referral, HBPM, pharmacist management, physician involvement, and the BP cuff. Only patients randomized to the vCCC rated pharmacist management and automated referral. Validated, 4-item scales: the Acceptability of Intervention Measure and the Feasibility of Intervention Measure were used. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d to \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d. A minimum threshold of 4.0 on the Acceptability and Feasibility scales was established a priori to demonstrate acceptability and feasibility, a lower bound used in other intervention assessments. Surveys included open-ended items. Patients evaluated programme components at the end-of-study visit while physicians and pharmacists evaluated them before enrolment and at 3 months after enrolment of the first patient. We used the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Disease (TICD) framework for determinant evaluation. Like other determinant frameworks, the TICD assesses motivational, organizational, and capability domains, but also includes attributes of the intervention and focuses on guideline-based clinical care delivery. Safety was assessed by comparing the symptom checklists obtained at baseline and 3 months and reporting any new symptom or event as an adverse event. Frequencies of HBPM and home BP readings were monitored through the Qardio app.\nData collection\nBP readings were obtained through the Qardio app. Demographic information (age, sex, race, and ethnicity), medical history (heart rate, BMI, and comorbidities), anti-hypertensive medications, laboratory values, and clinic-measured BP were obtained from the EHR. The number of anti-hypertensive medications per drug class was summarized. Survey ratings were collected via a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) electronic survey delivered by email. Study coordinators administered the surveys via telephone to any patients who did not complete the survey electronically.\nPhysician advisory board\nWe selected respected, experienced clinical leaders in the Departments of Internal Medicine and Family Medicine with credibility, commitment to BP control, quality improvement skills, and institutional linkages to participate in the pilot study. The physician advisory board (PAB) was initiated prior to patient enrolment and met monthly for the study duration. The PAB discussed study design, feedback from stakeholders, and potential adaptations to the programme in structured focus groups.\nWe conducted semi-structured interviews of participating pharmacists to optimize the intervention components and identify potential barriers and facilitators to implementation. Two pharmacists with greatest experience using vCCC were selected to provide in-depth feedback. Both physician and pharmacist interviews were conducted by an experienced interviewer (SDE) via Zoom. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.\nAnalysis\nDescriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations) were calculated for baseline characteristics, including baseline demographics, medical history, use of anti-hypertensive medications, and laboratory results. Descriptive statistics were also calculated for home BP readings at baseline and 12 weeks and change in BP from baseline. Mean BP values at baseline and 12 weeks within each treatment arm were compared with paired t-tests. Additionally, the differences in the average weekly number of BP readings between the two treatment arms were compared using a t-test. For the acceptability and feasibility measures, summary scores were calculated for each treatment arm using the average of the responses within each survey component and compared using t-tests (patient scores) and paired t-tests (provider scores).\nQualitative data were coded using a combination of inductive coding and template analysis. One coder identified emerging themes among patient open-ended survey item responses and compared themes between patients randomized to the vCCC versus usual care. Qualitative data collected from pharmacists and physicians were coded to TICD domains. Data were combined, and barriers were assessed for potential intervention or study execution changes. Coded themes were reviewed by a second investigator and revised until consensus was reached. Potential changes were reported to the study team and evaluated for salience by the PAB before adaptations were made, resulting in a set of key recommendations for action.\nWe adapted procedures so that all study operations, including recruitment, study visits, vCCC visits, PAB, and investigator meetings were done remotely for the safety of the patients, providers, and study staff during the COVID-19 pandemic."}, "openai_response": "No"}, "PMC10026083": {"class": 0, "title": "Implementing a home-based virtual hypertension programme\u2014a pilot feasibility study", "summary": {"Abstract": "Abstract\nINTRODUCTION\nLecanemab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated A\u03b2 species (protofibrils) with activity at amyloid plaques. Amyloid\u2010related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) profiles appear to differ for various anti\u2010amyloid antibodies. Here, we present ARIA data from a large phase 2 lecanemab trial (Study 201) in early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nStudy 201 trial was double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled (core) with an open\u2010label extension (OLE). Observed ARIA events were summarized and modeled via Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs. An exposure response model was developed.\nRESULTS\nIn the phase 2 core and OLE, there was a low incidence of ARIA\u2010E (<10%), with <3% symptomatic cases. ARIA\u2010E was generally asymptomatic, mild\u2010to\u2010moderate in severity, and occurred early (<3 months). ARIA\u2010E was correlated with maximum lecanemab serum concentration and incidence was higher in apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) homozygous carriers.

Details of the study design have been previously published and brief description of relevant methods can be found in the supplement.\n201 open\u2010label extension\nThe OLE was initiated following analysis of the core phase 2b Study 201 to allow subjects to receive open\u2010label lecanemab 10\u00a0mg/kg biweekly for up to 24 months to assess long\u2010term safety and tolerability. All subjects who fulfilled OLE inclusion/exclusion criteria and entered the OLE received 10\u00a0mg/kg biweekly during the OLE period, regardless of ApoE genotype. Since the OLE was added in an amendment to Study 201 after completion of the core study, there was a gap period between the end of the Study 201 core and OLE baseline when no treatment was provided, which was 9\u201359 months (mean and median: approximately 24 months). MRI was conducted to monitor for ARIA at 9 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months over the first 12 months of 10\u00a0mg/kg biweekly lecanemab treatment in the OLE (i.e., identical to the core phase of Study 201 in the first 12 months). After 12 months, MRI was conducted every 6 months. ARIA\u2010E and ARIA\u2010H data were summarized according to observed events in the longitudinal OLE period. In contrast to the core study where all cases of ARIA\u2010E were discontinued, ARIA management in the OLE allowed for uninterrupted dosing in radiographically mild or moderate asymptomatic cases of ARIA\u2010E, while dosing was interrupted for radiographically severe events, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, until resolution or stabilization, at which time resumption of treatment was permitted. ARIA\u2010E was best detected with the 2D\u2010T2FLAIR sequence used and ARIA\u2010H was best detected with the T2* sequence. Subjects who developed symptomatic ARIA\u2010H were also temporarily stopped from study drug administration. Subjects had safety visits (with MRI) at approximately 30 days after event was identified until ARIA resolved, at which time treatment could be resumed.\nExposure response analysis for safety (ARIA\u2010E)\nARIA\u2010E incidence was correlated with lecanemab maximum concentration at steady state (Css,max) using logistic regression analysis data from Study 201 across all dosing regimens. Covariates included age, gender, ApoE4 carrier genotype status, ongoing treatment with AChEIs and/or memantine, and clinical subgroup (MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia). Time\u2010to\u2010event (TTE) analysis was performed for time to the first observation of ARIA\u2010E.

Plasma pTau\u2010181 and GFAP correlate with tau PET, most strongly in left inferior temporal cortex (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0006, respectively). In regions beyond temporal cortex, tau PET uptake decreased with age for the same pTau\u2010181 or GFAP concentrations. FDG PET and brain volumes correlate with tau PET in numerous regions (such as inferior temporal: p = 0.0007, p = 0.00001, respectively). NfL, GFAP, and all imaging modalities correlate with baseline MMSE; subsequent MMSE decline is predicted by baseline parahippocampal and lateral temporal tau PET (p = 0.0007) and volume (p = 0.0006).

Exclusion criteria included neurologic, radiologic, or laboratory indications of non\u2010AD dementia; medications that might interact with rasagiline; and factors that might preclude study completion. Patients on stable doses of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for at least 3 months prior to randomization were permitted.\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT\n Systematic review: The authors performed an extensive review of the literature using PubMed, additional internet searches, and conference abstracts and presentations in order to develop hypotheses and to compare the findings of this study to other published findings. Prior relevant publications are cited.\n Interpretation: Our findings demonstrated significant relationships among plasma biomarkers, imaging measures, and cognitive status. Data also illustrated the heterogeneity present in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) populations and covariate influences to be considered when designing clinical trials or using plasma and imaging biomarkers to predict tau positron emission tomography (PET) levels for patient selection and analysis.\n Future directions: Future work would involve (a) confirmation in a larger study toward use in patient characterization for clinical trials and care, (b) work toward reducing variability in plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation, and (c) further establishment of normative references for plasma biomarkers.\nOf 96 patients screened, 50 patients, randomized 1:1 rasagiline to placebo, were enrolled. Our analyses used baseline data from all participants for cross\u2010sectional comparisons and from placebo\u2010treated participants to explore relationships to cognitive change. After excluding those with missing plasma biomarker data and follow\u2010up data (for longitudinal analyses), our analyses included 47 participants at baseline and 21 placebo\u2010treated participants for longitudinal comparisons.\nData acquisition and measurement\nClinical endpoints acquired at screening or baseline and at timepoints up to 26 weeks included MMSE, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale\u2013Cognitive Subscale (ADAS\u2010cog), Digit Span, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Volumetric MR (T1\u2010weighted) images were acquired at screening, FDG PET at screening and 24 weeks, and flortaucipir PET images at baseline and 24 weeks. Plasma pTau\u2010181, NfL, and GFAP were collected at baseline and at week 24; a 48\u2010plex panel of inflammatory biomarkers was collected at baseline (methods in Supplement).\nAnalyses\nBaseline characterization\nBaseline demographic, cognitive, imaging, and plasma biomarker distributions were characterized for the study population and three decade\u2010based age subgroups (57\u201069, 70\u201079, 80\u201090 years; see Supplement). Tau PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) referenced to cerebellar cortex (eroded to reduce spill\u2010in) were measured in a MetaTemporal composite, Braak stage composites, total cortex, and individual regions. FDG PET and brain volumes were measured in the same regions as tau PET, including regions known to exhibit progressive hypometabolism and atrophy in AD.\nTau PET and FDG PET measures were adjusted for normal aging using data acquired using the same tracers and protocols in amyloid\u2010negative cognitively unimpaired individuals as previously described. Volumetric measures were adjusted for intracranial volume, age, sex, and scanner using a normative reference of amyloid\u2010negative cognitively unimpaired individuals as implemented in ADM Diagnostics\u2019 CorInsights MRI\u00ae software. Plasma pTau\u2010181, NfL, and GFAP were adjusted for normal aging using slopes derived from amyloid\u2010negative cognitively impaired individuals in published studies using the same assays. Normative aging data were not available for inflammatory biomarkers (Supplement).\nRelationships between biomarkers\nInter\u2010region tau PET relationships were first examined as influenced by age and other covariates, focusing on relationships with inferior temporal cortex as it is an early region of NFT spread, used in criteria for clinical trial participation. To test our predefined hypotheses in this primarily tau PET+ (98%) population, we examined relationships between (a) plasma pTau\u2010181 and tau PET by region and cortical average, (b) plasma NfL and FDG PET in AD\u2010associated regions (medial temporal, lateral temporal, isthmus cingulate, inferior parietal, middle frontal), and (c) all biomarkers versus cognitive endpoints at baseline and 24\u2010week change. We similarly evaluated relationships between tau PET and NfL, GFAP, FDG PET, brain volumes, and combined plasma and FDG PET or volumetric biomarkers. As part of these investigations, we compared left\u2010right hemispheric imaging asymmetries as these ratios remove reference region effects, reducing technical variability.\nThe above relationships were evaluated using model fitting (standard least squares) in JMP v16 statistical software (SAS). Distributions were examined for normality and variables not meeting this condition (Shapiro\u2010Wilk and Anderson\u2010Darling tests, significance p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were log10 transformed (all plasma variables were transformed). Covariates of age, sex, APOE genotype; education for cognitive endpoint comparisons; and cognitive baseline values when evaluating 24\u2010week cognitive change were included in models when significant or trend level. Models were also evaluated within each age decade to minimize age effects (particularly for inflammatory markers where normal aging data were not available) and age correction effects. Nonlinear models and variable interactions were also investigated. Pearson correlation was applied except for non\u2010normal distributions or group sizes below fifteen, where Spearman's Rank Order (rho) or nonparametric Wilcoxon tests were used. Given the exploratory nature of this work, numerous comparisons were made and significance was considered p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, uncorrected for multiple comparisons; p\u2010values <0.0001 are likely candidates to survive Bonferroni correction. To further illustrate relationship patterns among the imaging biomarkers, we derived voxel\u2010based multivariate machine learning classifiers as described and shown in the Supplement.\nFor cross\u2010correlation heat maps, plasma variables with a coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) greater than 20% after log10 transformation were excluded. Spearman's Rank Order (rho) correlation was used to generate the younger and oldest age group maps due to their lower subject numbers.\nWe also examined whether pTau\u2010181 could have been used as a screen for tau PET positivity. Participants were considered tau PET+ if their bilateral MetaTemporal SUVR (without partial volume correction) exceeded 1.29 or other target region SUVRs were positive. A cutoff was estimated as the value above which all tau PET+ scans were found and compared to values reported for A\u2010 and A+ MCI subjects in a study using the same assay.

Patients were assessed at baseline and thereafter annually for 5\u2009years with clinical measures, symbol digit modality test (SDMT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), reflecting astrogliosis, and neurofilament light (NfL), reflecting axonal damage, were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples collected at baseline and after 2\u2009years in CSF, and annually in serum. Control subjects were symptomatic controls (SCs, n\u2009=\u200927), who were examined at baseline and after 5\u2009years without evidence of neurological disease.\nResults\nWhile the mean annualized relapse rate was significantly reduced from baseline at each year of follow-up, disability was essentially maintained at a median EDSS of 1.5 and IQR between 1.13 and 2.25. New MRI activity was recorded in 26 patients (53%) over 5\u2009years. The proportion of patients who achieved no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3), 6-months confirmed disability worsening (CDW), and 6-months confirmed disability improvement (CDI) at 5\u2009years were 33, 31, and 31%, respectively. The SDMT score was reduced for patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but unchanged for SCs. ALZ treatment did not change GFAP levels, whereas there was a significant decrease for RRMS patients in median CSF and serum NfL levels at follow-up [CSF month 24: 456\u2009pg./mL (IQR 285.4) (p\u2009=\u20090.05); serum month 24: 6.7\u2009pg/mL (IQR 4.7) (p\u2009<\u20090.01); serum month 60: 7.2\u2009pg/mL (IQR 4.7) (p\u2009<\u20090.01)], compared to baseline [CSF: 1014\u2009pg/mL (IQR 2832.5); serum 8.6\u2009pg/mL (IQR 17.4)].\nConclusion\nIn this real-world mono-center population, we observed a progression-free survival of 69%, cumulative NEDA-3 of 33%, and reduced NfL levels, over a five-year follow-up. This confirms ALZ as an effective pulsed immune reconstitution therapy that significantly reduces neuro axonal loss, and therefore has the potential to reduce long-term neurological disability. ALZ did not appear to affect astrogliosis.", "Method": "Materials and methods\nPatients and controls\nRRMS patients, 18\u2009years of age or more, fulfilling the 2017 revised McDonald diagnostic criteria of MS, were consecutively included in the study when they commenced ALZ treatment, at the MS Center, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, between July 2014 and May 2016. Eligible patients for ALZ treatment may have been previously untreated or treated with one or several DMTs. They should not have ongoing acute or chronic infection, severe cardiovascular disease, stroke, coagulation disorders or treatments that affected coagulation, and were not allowed to have other autoimmune diseases than MS. Age and sex matched symptomatic controls (SCs) were recruited from persons with symptoms suspected for MS, referred to the MS Center, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, between April 2014 and June 2016, and with negative diagnostic work-up. SCs were re-examined after five years. SCs were defined as having no history or signs of neurological disease, and no abnormal findings on imaging [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] or in the CSF analysis.\nTreatment\nPatients received 60\u2009mg intravenous (iv) ALZ on five consecutive days, and after 12\u2009months, a repeated dose of 36\u2009mg iv over three consecutive days. New courses of 36\u2009mg iv ALZ were administered at signs of new disease activity, i.e., relapse, and/or detection of new, enlarging or contrast-enhancing MRI lesions. Premedication with 1000\u2009mg iv methylprednisolone, oral antihistamine, paracetamol, and omeprazole was given the first three days of ALZ infusions. In addition, patients received prophylactic anti-herpesvirus treatment with acyclovir 200\u2009mg twice daily for one month.\nStudy design\nThis was a prospective mono-center observational study with a follow-up of five years. Patients were assessed at month 0 (baseline), 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 (Figure 1). Baseline was the date of initiating ALZ treatment. Patient baseline and follow-up outcomes were assessed by clinical evaluation of relapses, neurological examination with assessment of disability, cognitive test, MRI, CSF and serum concentrations of GFAP, and NfL. We also recorded the number of ALZ courses received per patient, durability of ALZ treatment, the proportion of patients who switched to another DMT, and adverse events.\nClinical outcome measures\nIf new neurological symptoms appeared, or if old symptoms returned, for a period of 24\u2009h or more, and no infection or raised core body temperature were present, this was categorized as a clinical relapse. Clinical activity was measured with the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Disability was assessed with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Confirmed disability worsening (CDW) was achieved if an increase in the EDSS score occurred, relative to baseline, and was confirmed over 6\u2009months. The threshold levels of change in EDSS to achieve CDW were as follows: an increase to 1.5 from a baseline EDSS of 0, an increase of 1 point from a baseline of 1\u20135.0, and an increase of 0.5 from a baseline EDSS score\u2009\u2265\u20095.5. Confirmed disability improvement (CDI) was achieved if a decrease in EDSS score occurred, relative to baseline, and was sustained for 6\u2009months or more. To achieve CDI there had to be a decrease in EDSS score of \u22651 point if baseline EDSS score was 2.0\u20135.5, or a decrease of \u22650.5 points if baseline score was \u22656.0. No evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3), was defined as absence of relapses, disability worsening, and new and/or enlarged T2 lesions, or gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI, while patients with either a relapse, MRI activity, or exacerbation of neurological disability, were considered as having evidence of disease activity-3 (EDA-3). Progression independent of relapses (PIRA) was defined as a 6-month CDW event with no previous or subsequent relapse during the five-year (60-month) follow-up period, whereas relapse associated worsening was defined as a 6-month CDW event with a previous relapse during follow-up.\nCognitive test\nCognition was assessed with symbol digit modality test (SDMT). To minimize learning bias a new version of SDMT was used at each time. We defined a clinically significant change in SDMT scores as an increase or decrease of eight or more raw score points from baseline, given that no reverse change in SDMT scores to less than in total eight points, compared with baseline, were observed during the following year. With a threshold of eight for SDMT, the following classification for RRMS patients were used: improvers (positive changes equal to or above the threshold level), maintainers (changes not reaching the threshold level) or decliners (negative changes equal to or above the threshold level).\nSafety\nThe common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE), Version 5.0, were used to grade adverse events. For early adverse events (<100\u2009days after ALZ initiation), adverse events of grade 3 or higher were recorded. For late adverse events (>100\u2009days after ALZ initiation) grade 2 or higher were recorded for autoimmune or infectious conditions, and grade 3 or higher for other adverse events.\nMRI\nBrain MRI according to Swedish guidelines in MS was performed, with a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner. We obtained T1- and T2-weighted sequences, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, and gadolinium-enhanced T1 sequences. In the major part of cases contrast-enhancement on MRI is visible during a period of 6\u2009weeks, mean 3.07\u2009weeks. To interrelate MRI measures, and CSF and serum biomarker concentrations, we therefore included MRI performed 6\u2009weeks prior to or after lumbar puncture and blood sampling. We defined new disease activity on MRI as occurrence of a new contrast-enhancing lesion or new or enlarged T2 lesions, compared to preceding MRI.\nBiomarker analysis\nSamples of CSF were obtained at month 0 and 24, and serum samples from peripheral blood were obtained at month 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60. The consensus protocol of the BioMS-EU network for CSF biomarker research in MS was followed. In short CSF samples were collected and transferred to polypropylene tubes for centrifugation at 20\u00b0C, 2200\u2009g for 10\u2009min. Samples were then distributed into 1\u2009mL aliquots in polypropylene vials, and permanently stored at \u221280\u00b0C pending analyses. Blood samples were collected, processed onsite to isolate serum, aliquoted, and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. All biomarker analyses were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians in the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital. To account for potential variation between plates, baseline and follow-up samples were analyzed side-by-side on the same assay plate. All analyses were performed at room temperature.\nThe analyses of CSF and serum biomarkers (NfL, and GFAP) were performed using the Simoa\u00ae NEUROLOGY 2-PLEX B Kit, Product number: 103520, from Quanterix (Billerica, MA, USA). Briefly, the samples, quality control (QC) samples, with one QC high (within the higher measurement interval) and one QC low (within the lower measurement interval), and a set of pre-mixed calibrator samples (Product number: 103520, Quanterix, Billerica, MA, USA) were removed from storage and allowed to thaw at room temperature. The resorufin-D-galactopyranoside reagent was shaken for 30\u2009min at 800\u2009rpm and 30\u00b0C. The samples, QCs, and calibrators were vortexed for 30\u2009s at 2000\u2009rpm. The samples and QCs were thereafter centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 4000\u2009g. CSF samples were diluted 40x (10x pre-dilution +4x on-board), and serum samples 4x (on-board), both with sample dilution reagent. The samples, QCs, and calibrators were added to a Simoa plate, the calibrators right after a throughout mixing. The assay reagents and a Simoa plate with samples, QCs, and calibrators were loaded in a HD-1 Analyzer (Quanterix, Lexington, MA, USA), the beads after a throughout mixing for 30\u2009s, and the measurements initiated. Intra- and inter assay coefficients of variation were below 10% for both QC high and QC low, for both GFAP and NfL. The functional Lower Limit of Quantification (fLLoQ) for serum GFAP and NfL was 29.4\u2009pg/mL, respectively, 1.41\u2009pg/mL. The fLLoQ for CSF was 10x the fLLoQ for serum. The CSF and serum samples of GFAP and NfL below the fLLoQ level were designated the value of fLLoQ.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistical analyses were used to analyze data. Continuous variables are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR), mean and standard deviation (SD), or mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). Categorical variables are expressed as the frequency and percentage. As the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric tests were used. Wilcoxon matched-pair singed-rank test was used to evaluate changes in continuous variables within groups, between two measured times. Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables between groups. Fischer\u2019s exact test was used to compare categorical variables between groups. Cumulative probabilities of NEDA-3, CDW, and CDI were estimated with Kaplan\u2013Meier curves. To assess the impact of baseline variables (age, gender, diagnosis duration, EDSS, and CSF NfL) on the outcomes of fulfilling EDA-3, CDW, and CDI at five-year follow-up, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analyses with corresponding log-rank tests were performed. For these analyses we used categorical nominal variables of age, diagnosis duration, EDSS, and CSF NfL. The cut-off for age (\u226430\u2009years) was based on previous reports regarding a significant change in the relationship between disability and onset age after about 30\u2009years. Diagnosis duration was divided into three groups: \u22643\u2009years, >3 to <10\u2009years, and\u2009>\u200910\u2009years, and EDSS into two groups: <3, and\u2009\u2265\u20093. The cut-off (>2136\u2009pg/mL) for CSF NfL was based on calculation of the third of patients with the highest CSF NfL. For statistical analyses SPSS version 28.00 (IBM, NY, US) and GraphPad Prism 10.0.2 (GraphPad Inc., California, USA) were used. All tests were two-sided, with a significance threshold of p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05."}, "openai_response": "No"}, "PMC10612416": {"class": 0, "title": "Unbiased insights into the multiplicity of the CYP46A1 brain effects in 5XFAD mice treated with low-dose efavirenz", "summary": {"Abstract": "", "Method": ""}, "openai_response": "No"}, "PMC10612417": {"class": 0, "title": "", "summary": {"Abstract": "", "Method": ""}, "openai_response": "No"}, "PMC11230216": {"class": 0, "title": "Relationships between plasma biomarkers, tau PET, FDG PET, and volumetric MRI in mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients", "summary": {"Abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease currently has no cure and is usually detected too late for interventions to be effective. In this study we have focused on cognitively normal subjects to study the impact of risk factors on their long-range brain connections. To detect vulnerable connections, we devised a multiscale, hierarchical method for spatial clustering of the whole brain tractogram and examined the impact of age and APOE allelic variation on cognitive abilities and bundle properties including texture e.g., mean fractional anisotropy, variability, and geometric properties including streamline length, volume, and shape, as well as asymmetry. We found that the third level subdivision in the bundle hierarchy provided the most sensitive ability to detect age and genotype differences associated with risk factors. Our results indicate that frontal bundles were a major age predictor, while the occipital cortex and cerebellar connections were important risk predictors that were heavily genotype dependent, and showed accelerated decline in fractional anisotropy, shape similarity, and increased asymmetry. Cognitive metrics related to olfactory memory were mapped to bundles, providing possible early markers of neurodegeneration. In addition, physiological metrics such as diastolic blood pressure were associated with changes in white matter tracts. Our novel method for a data driven analysis of sensitive changes in tractography may differentiate populations at risk for AD and isolate specific vulnerable networks.", "Method": "Methods\nSubjects\nAll experimental procedures have been previously reported in (Mahzarnia et al, 2023), with this paragraph serving as an updated brief overview. The procedures were approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. All participants, and where applicable study partners or caregivers, provided informed consent, and were compensated for their time at the end of the study. A total of 78 subjects were recruited, 33 males, and 45 females with a combined age range from 20 to 80 years (yrs) (median age 50.44 yrs, mean \u00b1 std: 50.4 \u00b1 15.15 yrs). APOE genotype allelic distribution was 7 APOE2/APOE3 carriers (9% of study cohort); 35 APOE3 homozygous carriers (45%); 29 APOE3/4 carriers (37%), 7 APOE4/4 homozygous carriers (9%). Twenty-one participants (27%) had no known family history of LOAD and 57 (73%) had family relatives with LOAD.\nPhysiological, Behavioral & Cognitive Evaluation\nWe measured body, mass, height, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure as physiological parameters for subsequent analysis. Cognitive evaluation was based upon performances with the NACC UDS3 neuropsychological assessment battery. The UDS3 tests used in this study included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) screen; Craft Story to assess unstructured, auditory-verbal narrative learning and memory; the Trail Making Test, with parts A and B used to assess graphomotor and visual scanning speed, and part B assessing the complex task rule maintenance and switching under timed conditions; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \u2013 3rd revision (WAIS-3) Digit Symbol subtest to assess information processing speed; Categorical Verbal Fluency (animals, vegetables) and Lexical Verbal Fluency (F-words, L-words), assessing speed of distributed lexical search and semantic memory and the Digit Span subtest from the WAIS-3, assessing auditory verbal attention, as well as working memory when using the backwards test. On top of the UDS3 battery of cognitive tests, we administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) for assessing structured, auditory verbal word list learning and memory \nAdditionally, we assessed olfactory sensory function, as well as short- and long-term memory for olfactory stimuli, measuring valence on aspects of odor pleasantness, intensity and familiarity. Dynamic visuo-spatial attention abilities were assessed using the computerized Useful Field of View (UFoV) Test from BrainHQ with both the presence of passive and active distractors. For statistical analysis, all subject traits, and cognitive tests metrics were converted to a z-score and combined across cognitive domains as seen in Table 1.\nImaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 3T GE Premier Performance scanner with Signa Premier version (ver. 28) with a 60 cm gradient coil with peak strength of 115 mT/m, and a 48-channel head coil. Diffusion weighted images were acquired using a robust motion-resistant, multi-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with 4 interleaved shots and reconstructed using MUSE. Parameters were set at TE 60.6 ms/TR = 14,725 ms, resolution of 1\u00d71\u00d71 mm isotropic, FOV at 25.6\u00d725.6cm (256\u00d7256 matrix) and 136 slices. Overall, 21 diffusion directions (b = \u20601000 s/mm2) and 3 non-diffusion weighted images were acquired in 24 minutes. In addition, anatomical data were acquired using a 3D T1-weighted IR-FSPGR-BRAVO sequence with TE = 3.2 ms, TR = 2263.7 ms, flip angle 8\u00b0, prep time 900 ms, recovery time 700 ms, 256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 160 slices, 25.6 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 16 mm FOV, with image acquisition time of 5 min, 17 s.\nImage and Bundle Analysis\nAll diffusion images were preprocessed using a pipeline that included FSL-BET for brain masking, ANTs for co-registration and eddy current correction, and a Principal Component Analysis denoising process. The MRtrix toolbox was used for creating diffusion parametric maps, (e.g., fractional anisotropy, FA) which provide important estimates of microstructural tissue integrity and additionnal voxel level diffusion characteristics.\nThe MRtrix toolbox generated the streamlines of individuals using Anatomically-Constrained Tractography (ACT), in which diffusion maps were co-registered with subject-specific anatomical T1-weighted imaging data segmented into five tissue type maps (e.g., grey matter, sub-cortical grey matter, white matter, CSF and pathological tissue maps). This ACT correction method helps guarantee that generated streamline models are properly aligned with the individual brain anatomy of the subject, while also allowing anatomically truncated tracks to be re-tracked. White matter tract fiber streamline generation was carried out via a probabilistic method second-order integration of Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD) with grey matter seeding. A FOD cutoff of 0.06 was used with a step size of 0.1 mm, a minimum length of 2 mm, a maximum length of 250 mm, and a 45\u00b0 limitation angle. Two million streamlines were generated per participant. The resulting streamlines were then registered into study-specific cohort average brain space using the same rigid and affine transformations applied via the \u2018dipy\u2019 package and the resulting warp transforms were applied via mrtrix3 and the tcktransform function.\nAfter ACT streamline quality control procedures, streamlines were subdivided across all participants into anatomically consistent and equivalent groupings based on pathing results. The multi-level spatial clustering approach was conducted by first downsampling streamlines downsampled into a set of 20,000 streamlines. Then, twenty individuals were randomly selected to be used as a standard template. The downsampled streamlines from all these individuals were combined into a single set, for which the right-side streamlines were flipped onto the left side of the brain to include input from both sides of the brain. From there, we formed our basic bundle centroids using dipy to form the basis of our future sets of bundles, that were made to be symmetrically equivalent for the left and right side of the brain, at first six pairs of centroids overall. The centroids were then compared to the streamlines of all subjects and used to extract the streamlines closet to the established centroids. Once this was done once initially, the process was repeated onto the already separated bundles, now establishing on every iteration three bundle descendants based on the previous set. This iterative process separates all streamlines of the brain into a set of 6, 18, 54, 162 pairs of ever smaller bundles that are equivalent across all subjects. This method allows us to divide our brain for all subjects into small sets of bundles that are 100% streamline based rather than based on previously established structures.\nFrom each bundle, we extracted multiple metrics, specifically the mean of the FA among streamlines, the standard deviation of the FA, the number of streamlines, the length of streamlines, the volume of the bundle (determined by the number of voxels traversed by the streamlines), the asymmetry, L2 norm of FA measures, as well as the BUndle ANalytics for comparing left and right side bundles in order to determine their similarity in shape in each subject (after being superposed to each other).\nOnce these statistics were extracted and summarized, the statistics for each bundle were compared to the age and genotype of subjects, using a linear model for most metrics, but using a quadratic model for average FA vs age. The bundle statistics were also compared to average cognitive measurements (see Table 1) and physiological data (Height, Weight, Systolic pressure, Diastolic pressure). The results were corrected with False Discovery rate (FDR) based on the number of bundles and the number of metrics each statistic was compared to.

In our ageing population, the management and recognition of both becomes increasingly relevant. In this review, we explore the pathophysiology behind this relationship between CI and heart attacks/heart disease. We also discuss risk factors for CI in patients with heart attacks, including the impact of age, sex, and heart failure after the heart attack. We explore how interventions for heart attacks, including percutaneous coronary angiography and bypass surgery, seem to be associated with higher rates of CI, though it is not clear whether this is related to the procedure itself or to the similar underlying risk factors. Finally, we explore how medical management, including most medications prescribed for heart attack patients, can have a positive impact on reducing the risk of CI in patients post-heart attack, though one medication (beta-blocker) may be associated with functional decline in patients with existing CI. The early identification of those with dementia or CI who present with a heart attack is important, as the subsequent tailoring of management strategies can potentially improve outcomes as well as guide prognosis.\nAbstract\nCognitive impairment (CI) shares common cardiovascular risk factors with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is increasingly prevalent in our ageing population. Whilst AMI is associated with increased rates of CI, CI remains underreported and infrequently identified in patients with AMI. In this review, we discuss the evidence surrounding AMI and its links to dementia and CI, including pathophysiology, risk factors, management and interventions. Vascular dysregulation plays a major role in CI, with atherosclerosis, platelet activation, microinfarcts and perivascular inflammation resulting in neurovascular unit dysfunction, disordered homeostasis and a dysfunctional neurohormonal response. This subsequently affects perfusion pressure, resulting in enlarged periventricular spaces and hippocampal sclerosis. The increased platelet activation seen in coronary artery disease (CAD) can also result in inflammation and amyloid-\u03b2 protein deposition which is associated with Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia. Post-AMI, reduced blood pressure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction can cause chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, cerebral infarction and failure of normal circulatory autoregulatory mechanisms. Patients who undergo coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or bypass surgery) are at increased risk for post-procedure cognitive impairment, though whether this is related to the intervention itself or underlying cardiovascular risk factors is debated. Mortality rates are higher in dementia patients with AMI, and post-AMI CI is more prevalent in the elderly and in patients with post-AMI heart failure. Medical management (antiplatelet, statin, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, cardiac rehabilitation) can reduce the risk of post-AMI CI; however, beta-blockers may be associated with functional decline in patients with existing CI.

To carry out MTAG analysis, we first pre-processed and quality-controlled summary statistics from each study involved: SNP (rs) ids were retrieved, and Z-score was computed by log (OR)/SE when these were not available; MAF threshold was set at 0.01; indels were removed and SNPs mapping to the same position of other variants and/or showing conflicting alleles among different studies were dropped. After variant filtering, the number of variants left for analysis was 8,632,257 for AD; 6,582,074 for PD; 7,183,400 for MDD; 8,933,201 for Plt; 8,933,763 for MPV; and 8,934,170 for PDW. Of these, 4,540,326 variants were in common among the different studies and, therefore, underwent MTAG analysis. Using Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) platform, we first identified LD-independent genome-wide significant SNPs within each study (p < 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22128; pairwise r2 < 0.6 in a 1\u2009Mb window). Then, we selected novel genome-wide significant SNP associations with the analyzed disorders, defined as associations not detected as genome-wide significant in the original study, nor in previous GWASs of the same disorder, based on the GWAS catalog and literature search until 30 April 2022 (Table 1).\nTo have further biological insights into the underlying biology of common variance in different neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative disorders and platelet parameters, associations underwent gene, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis through MAGMA v1.08, within the FUMA platform. This was carried out for all the protein-coding genes to which at least one SNP was annotated within a \u00b110 kb interval, namely, 18,781 genes. A Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied accordingly, based on the number of genes tested (\u03b1 = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22126) (Table 2).\nTo estimate protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) among the genes enriched for associations, we used the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins in db-STRING v11.5. We analyzed genes significantly enriched for associations with AD, PD and MDD, first separately and then merged into a single list, to compute \u201cglobal\u201d interactions among all the genes significantly enriched for any of the three disorders. The obtained network included both direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations, specifically evidence of interaction from curated databases; evidence experimentally determined; gene neighborhood; gene fusions; gene co-occurrence; joint gene mentioning based on\u2009text mining in published articles; gene co-expression; and protein homology. We set a minimum interaction score of >0.7 so that only high-confidence interactions between proteins were included in the analysis. The observed excess of interactions compared to the expected number of edges among nodes, average node degree (i.e., the average number of edges per node in the graph) and local clustering coefficient (i.e., a measure of the extent to which nodes in the graph tend to cluster together) were taken as measures of network density and clustering levels."}, "openai_response": "No"}, "PMC10612421": {"class": 0, "title": "", "summary": {"Abstract": "", "Method": ""}, "openai_response": "No"}, "PMC10630899": {"class": 0, "title": "A five-year observational prospective mono-center study of the efficacy of alemtuzumab in a real-world cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis", "summary": {"Abstract": "This prognostic study investigates the algorithmic fairness by sex, race, and ethnicity of machine learning models predicting Alzheimer disease progression.\nKey Points\nQuestion\nDo algorithms to predict Alzheimer disease exhibit vulnerabilities to biases that are associated with unfair decisions and favoring of specific groups of people?\nFindings\nIn this prognostic study of 1730 participants in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, models predicting progression to mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease had lower sensitivity for Hispanic participants compared with non-Hispanic participants and for Black and Asian participants compared with non-Hispanic White participants. Models generally satisfied metrics of fairness with respect to sex.\nMeaning\nThis study found that machine learning models had notable deficits in fairness across race and ethnicity groups.\nImportance\nPredictive models using machine learning techniques have potential to improve early detection and management of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, these models potentially have biases and may perpetuate or exacerbate existing disparities.\nObjective\nTo characterize the algorithmic fairness of longitudinal prediction models for AD progression.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis prognostic study investigated the algorithmic fairness of logistic regression, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks for predicting progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using data from participants in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative evaluated at 57 sites in the US and Canada. Participants aged 54 to 91 years who contributed data on at least 2 visits between September 2005 and May 2017 were included. Data were analyzed in October 2022.\nExposures\nFairness was quantified across sex, ethnicity, and race groups. Neuropsychological test scores, anatomical features from T1 magnetic resonance imaging, measures extracted from positron emission tomography, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were included as predictors.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nOutcome measures quantified fairness of prediction models (logistic regression [LR], support vector machine [SVM], and recurrent neural network [RNN] models), including equal opportunity, equalized odds, and demographic parity. Specifically, if the model exhibited equal sensitivity for all groups, it aligned with the principle of equal opportunity, indicating fairness in predictive performance.\nResults\nA total of 1730 participants in the cohort (mean [SD] age, 73.81 [6.92] years; 776 females [44.9%]; 69 Hispanic [4.0%] and 1661 non-Hispanic [96.0%]; 29 Asian [1.7%], 77 Black [4.5%], 1599 White [92.4%], and 25 other race [1.4%]) were included. Sensitivity for predicting progression to MCI and AD was lower for Hispanic participants compared with non-Hispanic participants; the difference (SD) in true positive rate ranged from 20.9% (5.5%) for the RNN model to 27.8% (9.8%) for the SVM model in MCI and 24.1% (5.4%) for the RNN model to 48.2% (17.3%) for the LR model in AD. Sensitivity was similarly lower for Black and Asian participants compared with non-Hispanic White participants; for example, the difference (SD) in AD true positive rate was 14.5% (51.6%) in the LR model, 12.3% (35.1%) in the SVM model, and 28.4% (16.8%) in the RNN model for Black vs White participants, and the difference (SD) in MCI true positive rate was 25.6% (13.1%) in the LR model, 24.3% (13.1%) in the SVM model, and 6.8% (18.7%) in the RNN model for Asian vs White participants. Models generally satisfied metrics of fairness with respect to sex, with no significant differences by group, except for cognitively normal (CN)\u2013MCI and MCI-AD transitions (eg, an absolute increase [SD] in the true positive rate of CN-MCI transitions of 10.3% [27.8%] for the LR model).\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this study, models were accurate in aggregate but failed to satisfy fairness metrics. These findings suggest that fairness should be considered in the development and use of machine learning models for AD progression.", "Method": "Methods\nThis prognostic study followed the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) reporting guideline. Written informed consent was obtained for participation in ADNI, as approved by the institutional review board at each participating center. Ethical approval and informed consent were not required because this study, consisting of secondary data analysis of coded data that cannot be linked to individual participants, is not considered human participants research according to the policies of the Institutional Review Board of the University Pennsylvania.\nPopulation\nData were derived from the ADNI to facilitate study of AD progression. In brief, ADNI enrolled participants aged 54 to 91 years at 57 sites in the US and Canada. Our data set incorporated longitudinal data from multiple ADNI study phases and measurements from every participant contributing data on at least 2 visits between September 2005 and May 2017. Clinical status at each visit was classified as cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD.\nProtected Attributes\nTo evaluate fairness criteria, groups were defined by demographic attributes. We focused on attributes of sex, ethnicity, and race because previous studies in the fairness literature have highlighted algorithmic bias according to these characteristics. All characteristics were classified according to participant self-report. Sex was classified as female or male. Ethnicity was classified as not Hispanic or Latino or Hispanic or Latino. Participants reporting unknown ethnicity were excluded from ethnicity-stratified analyses. Race included 7 distinct groups: Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black or African American, Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, and more than 1 reported race. We aggregated America Indian and Alaskan Native, Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, more than 1 race, and unknown into a category labeled other due to their small population sizes and evaluated fairness across 4 racial categories: Asian, Black, White, and other.\nStudy Design\nWe defined unfairness, or algorithmic bias, as differences in the predictive performance of an ML algorithm across subpopulations defined by a protected attribute. For example, differences in sensitivity of a model for predicting AD progression in a Black population compared with a White population would be indicative of unfairness. We focused on 3 commonly used fairness metrics: equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity. These criteria have natural interpretations in the context of AD progression prediction. Equal opportunity is defined as equal sensitivity or true positive rates (TPRs) of the ML algorithm across all levels of the protected attribute. An AD progression algorithm would exhibit equal opportunity if individuals who progressed to AD were equally likely to be identified by the algorithm across all protected groups. Equalized odds requires that an algorithm exhibit equal opportunity and equal specificity or false positive rates (FPRs) across groups. Demographic parity is the equivalence of a predicted event\u2019s probability across groups by sensitive attribute. For progression to AD, demographic parity with respect to sex would be satisfied if females and males were predicted to develop AD with equal probability. When real differences in outcome prevalence exist across groups, achieving demographic parity may be undesirable. Importantly, unless prevalence is equal across groups, it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy all metrics. Table 1 presents mathematical definitions of these fairness metrics.\nPrediction Models\nWe assessed fairness with respect to the task of predicting AD progression with ML algorithms. We selected 3 ML models for evaluation in this study: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and recurrent neural network (RNN) models. We included LR and SVM because they are well-established ML models commonly used for prediction problems and are often presented as comparators for new models. As a deep-learning model, RNN has shown promise in the AD progression domain and has been applied to prediction problems, demonstrating improvement over other ML models on prediction accuracy. The RNN model we tested in this study is from Nguyen et al. Given multimodal predictors and the diagnostic status of a participant at baseline, we sought to predict diagnosis stage at the subsequent visit as CN, MCI, or AD for all subsequent months. We defined progression trajectories as transition from baseline CN to MCI, baseline MCI to AD, stable CN, and stable MCI (ie, patients recorded at the same stage at baseline and at a final visit). Predictors included neuropsychological test scores, anatomical features derived from magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography measures, and cerebrospinal fluid markers (see complete list of predictors in Table 2). Additional details of model implementation and training are provided in eMethods in Supplement 1.\nWe used cross-validation for model selection and evaluation. Data were randomly partitioned into 10 equal subsets. Each 10-fold cross-validation iteration used 80% of participants for training, 10% of participants for model validation, and 10% of participants for testing. The training set was used for model fitting, the validation set for hyperparameter selection, and the test set for model performance evaluation. All continuous variables were z normalized using the training set to estimate the mean and SD, which were then used to z normalize validation and test sets. The multiclass area under the operating curve and balanced class accuracy were used to evaluate models (eMethods and eTable 2 in Supplement 1).\nStatistical Analysis\nTo assess algorithmic fairness, we calculated fairness metrics on each of 10 test sets using predictions from each model. Metrics are reported as the mean and SD across the 10 values. Evaluations were conducted separately by demographic group. We first assessed equal opportunity by computing the TPR for groups defined by each protected attribute separately for each cognitive functioning trajectory (ie, CN to MCI, MCI to AD, stable CN, and stable MCI) and each of 3 models. The TPR quantifies the proportion of individuals experiencing a given trajectory who were correctly predicted to follow that trajectory. For instance, the TPR of CN to MCI represents the probability of correctly predicting that an individual progressed from CN to MCI. A TPR value of 1 indicates that the model has achieved perfect sensitivity in identifying the positive instances within the category. If the TPRs for each trajectory are similar across protected feature categories, it suggests that the model attained equal opportunity. We also calculated differences in TPR between groups for each protected attribute. In addition to TPR, we calculated the FPR. Specifically, for a given trajectory the FPR is defined as the proportion of individuals who did not experience that trajectory who were incorrectly predicted to follow that trajectory. For example, the FPR of CN to MCI represents the probability of predicting progression from CN to MCI for an individual who did not progress. An algorithm must demonstrate equal TPR and equal FPR across groups to satisfy the equalized odds criterion. To assess demographic parity, we computed the predicted probability for each individual. We report the difference in mean predicted probabilities across groups for each sensitive attribute, trajectory, and ML model. Finally, we calculated the empirical probability of each trajectory stratified by demographic group. Hypothesis testing was not used in this context due to the lack of independence among predicted values on test sets. Additionally, due to small sample sizes in some groups, nonparametric and parametric tests are expected to have low power. We therefore focused on point estimation and interpretation of point estimates given their variability. An overview of the experimental procedure is shown in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1.

Methods: A sample of 58 elderly participants, of which 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment with CFS biomarker evidence of AD, 23 individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and 15 healthy controls (HCs), was tested by a modified version of the Detour Navigation Test (DNT-mv).

For unclear reasons, PD patients with certain GBA1 mutations (GBA-PD) have a more aggressive clinical progression. Two testable hypotheses that can potentially account for this phenomenon are that GBA1 mutations promote \u03b1syn spread or drive the generation of highly pathogenic \u03b1syn polymorphs (i.e., strains). We tested these hypotheses by treating homozygous GBA1 D409V knockin (KI) mice with human \u03b1-syn-preformed fibrils (PFFs) and treating wild-type mice (WT) with several \u03b1syn-PFF polymorphs amplified from brain autopsy samples collected from patients with idiopathic PD and GBA-PD patients with either homozygous or heterozygous GBA1 mutations. Robust phosphorylated-\u03b1syn (PSER129) positive pathology was observed at the injection site (i.e., the olfactory bulb granule cell layer) and throughout the brain six months following PFF injection. The PFF seeding efficiency and degree of spread were similar regardless of the mouse genotype or PFF polymorphs. We found that PFFs amplified from the human brain, regardless of patient genotype, were generally more effective seeders than wholly synthetic PFFs (i.e., non-amplified); however, PFF concentration differed between these two studies, which might also account for the observed differences. To investigate whether the molecular composition of pathology differed between different seeding conditions, we performed Biotinylation by Antibody Recognition on PSER129 (BAR-PSER129). We found that for BAR-PSER129, the endogenous PSER129 pool dominated identified interactions, and thus, very few potential interactions were explicitly identified for seeded pathology. However, we found Dynactin Subunit 2 (Dctn2) interaction was shared across all PFF conditions, and NCK Associated Protein 1 (Nckap1) and Adaptor Related Protein Complex 3 Subunit Beta 2 (Ap3b2) were unique to PFFs amplified from GBA-PD brains of heterozygous mutation carriers.

Nevertheless, the direct observation of A\u03b2 is rarely paired with the observation of other biomarker candidates. To this end, we established a method that quantitatively predicts A\u03b2 accumulation from biomarker candidates by integrating the mostly unpaired observations via a few-shot learning approach.

C9orf72 HRE is associated with lowered levels of C9orf72 expression and its translation results in the production of dipeptide-repeats (DPRs). To recapitulate C9orf72-related ALS disease in vivo, we developed a zebrafish model where we expressed glycine-proline (GP) DPR in a c9orf72 knockdown context. We report that C9orf72 gain- and loss-of-function properties act synergistically to induce motor neuron degeneration and paralysis with poly(GP) accumulating preferentially within motor neurons along with Sqstm1/p62 aggregation indicating macroautophagy/autophagy deficits. Poly(GP) levels were shown to accumulate upon c9orf72 downregulation and were comparable to levels assessed in autopsy samples of patients carrying C9orf72 HRE. Chemical boosting of autophagy using rapamycin or apilimod, is able to rescue motor deficits. Proteomics analysis of zebrafish-purified motor neurons unravels mitochondria dysfunction confirmed through a comparative analysis of previously published C9orf72 iPSC-derived motor neurons. Consistently, 3D-reconstructions of motor neuron demonstrate that poly(GP) aggregates colocalize to mitochondria, thus inducing their elongation and swelling and the failure of their processing by mitophagy, with mitophagy activation through urolithin A preventing locomotor deficits. Finally, we report apoptotic-related increased amounts of cleaved Casp3 (caspase 3, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase) and rescue of motor neuron degeneration by constitutive inhibition of Casp9 or treatment with decylubiquinone.

In this study, a phenolic profile screening through an HPLC\u2013ESI-QQQ-MS/MS approach was applied to C. japonica flower extracts, revealing a total of 36 compounds, including anthocyanins, curcuminoids, dihydrochalcones, dihydroflavonols, flavonols, flavones, hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, isoflavonoids, stilbenes, and tyrosols. Following extract profiling, their bioactivity was assessed by means of in vitro antioxidant, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and neuroprotective activities. The results showed a multifaceted high correlation of phenolic compounds with all the tested bioactivities according to Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis, unraveling the potential of C. japonica flowers as promising sources of nutraceuticals. Overall, these findings provide insight into the valorization of C. japonica flowers from different unexplored cultivars thus diversifying their industrial outcome.", "Method": "Data analysis was performed using R software version 4.2.0 (R Development Core Team, 2011).

It primarily causes fetal microcephaly and neuronal defects through maternal transmission and induces neurological complications in adults. Recent studies report elevated proinflammatory cytokines and persistent neurological alterations post recovery, but the in vivo mechanisms remain unclear. In our study, viral RNA loads in the brains of mice infected with ZIKV peaked at 7 days post infection and returned to baseline by day 21, indicating recovery. RNA sequencing of the cerebral cortex at 7 and 21 days revealed upregulated genes related to neuroinflammation and microglial activation. Histological analyses indicated neuronal cell death and altered neurite morphology owing to severe neuroinflammation. Additionally, sustained microglial activation was associated with increased phospho-Tau levels, constituting a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings highlight how persistent microglial activation leads to neuronal dysfunction post ZIKV recovery, providing insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced brain abnormalities.

The traditional Chinese medicine compound Xiaojian Zhongtang (XJZT) has a good therapeutic effect on MDD, but the specific mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanism of XJZT in the treatment of MDD through network pharmacology and bioinformatics. The traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology database was used to screen the chemical components and targets of XJZT, while the online Mendelian inheritance in man, DisGeNET, Genecards, and therapeutic target database databases were used to collect MDD targets and identify the intersection targets of XJZT and MDD. A \u201cdrugs-components-targets\u201d network was constructed using the Cytoscape platform, and the STRING was used for protein-protein interaction analysis of intersecting targets. Gene Ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis of intersecting targets was performed using the DAVID database. Obtain serum and brain transcriptome datasets of MDD from the gene expression omnibus database, and perform differentially expressed genes, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. A total of 127 chemical components and 767 targets were obtained from XJZT, among which quercetin, kaempferol, and maltose are the core chemical components, and 1728 MDD targets were screened out, with 77 intersecting targets between XJZT and MDD. These targets mainly involve AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complexes, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, and HIF-1 signaling pathway, and these core targets have strong binding activity with core components. In addition, 1166 differentially expressed genes were identified in the MDD serum transcriptome dataset, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified the most relevant gene modules (1269 genes), among which RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1), D(4) dopamine receptor (DRD4), and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) were target genes for the treatment of MDD with XJZT, these 3 genes are mainly related to the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, and Huntington disease pathways, and the expression of AKT1, DRD4, and KMO was also found in the MDD brain transcriptome dataset, which is significantly correlated with the occurrence of MDD.

When available, peripheral tissues collected pre-surgery were used in cross-tissue correlations. For correlations across subjects of brain TL and each peripheral tissue sample TL, outliers were identified using a ROUT outliers test. One outlier was removed from Buccal vs. Brain analysis. Four outliers were removed from each of the Blood vs. Brain and Saliva vs. Brain analyses. After exclusion of outliers, partial correlation was performed controlling for age to compute Pearson correlation coefficient; age was used as a covariate since peripheral TL shortens across the lifespan (Demanelis et al.,).

Despite their advantages in crop production and disease management, the use of pesticides poses significant hazards to the environment and public health. Pesticide elements have now perpetually entered our atmosphere and subsequently contaminated water, food, and soil, leading to health threats ranging from acute to chronic toxicities. Pesticides can cause acute toxicity if a high dose is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with the skin or eyes, while prolonged or recurrent exposure to pesticides leads to chronic toxicity. Pesticides produce different types of toxicity, for instance, neurotoxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and endocrine disruption. The toxicity of a pesticide formulation may depend on the specific active ingredient and the presence of synergistic or inert compounds that can enhance or modify its toxicity. Safety concerns are the need of the hour to control contemporary pesticide-induced health hazards. The effectiveness and implementation of the current legislature in providing ample protection for human health and the environment are key concerns.

Stemming from the obstruction of blood flow, ischemic stroke, leads to cerebral tissue hypoxia and ischemia, instigating a cascade of pathophysiological changes that markedly exacerbate neuronal damage and may even culminate in cell death. In recent years, emerging research has increasingly focused on novel cell death mechanisms such as ferroptosis and cuproptosis.

The advantages of this method lie in its relatively short treatment duration and lower therapeutic dosage, reducing unnecessary side effects. Furthermore, considering the oxidative stress characteristic of ischemic stroke, antioxidant therapy is also regarded as a crucial targeted strategy.

However, if they did not accept it, the MTR would not be used in the end. This would be a public health issue because isolated older adults would not benefit from supervised APA, yet beneficial to their health. To this end, 334 participants answered a survey that measured different psychological variables, based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). Student\u2019s t-tests and structural equation modeling were used for data processing. Results showed that, before use, there was not any significant difference between teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 acceptance of the MTR. Then, perceived usefulness for teaching APA, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the MTR were lower than the mean of the scale, while perceived usefulness for older adults was higher than the mean of the scale.

This exploration assesses Neurocognitive Remediation Therapy (NRT) as an innovative solution for addressing cognitive deficits linked to depression and anxiety in these pilots. Theoretical underpinnings of NRT draw from cognitive rehabilitation, neuropsychology, and neuroplasticity principles. Depression and anxiety often manifest as cognitive deficits, impacting attention, memory, executive functions, and decision-making. NRT interventions aim to address these impairments by enhancing cognitive flexibility, attentional control, and memory through training exercises and cognitive restructuring, empowering individuals to regain cognitive functionality and adaptability. Empirical evidence supports NRT\u2019s efficacy in enhancing cognitive functioning, showing significant improvements in attention, memory, and executive functions. This review focuses on NRT\u2019s potential to improve cognition in community pilots, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing cognitive deficits and enhancing job performance, even in high-pressure environments like aviation. The practical implications of NRT for pilots are profound. Tailored programs can address specific cognitive challenges, such as maintaining vigilance and decision-making under stress. Integrating NRT into training regimens enhances skill sets and mental resilience, contributing to safety and success. Additionally, NRT positively impacts emotional well-being, reducing stress and improving overall quality of life. In Conclusion, NRT emerges as a promising intervention for enhancing cognitive functioning in community-living pilots with depression and anxiety. Evidence suggests its potential to improve performance, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. Further research and implementation are crucial to fully realize its benefits and ensure pilots\u2019 safety and success.", "Method": "Anxiety: While anxiety can sometimes lead to heightened arousal and faster reactions, chronic anxiety may exhaust cognitive resources, leading to fatigue and delayed responses. Reduced energy and motivation associated with depression can impact communication skills. Effective communication is vital in aviation for transmitting and receiving critical information anxious individuals may struggle with clear and concise communication, especially under pressure, potentially leading to misunderstandings in communication between pilots and air traffic control. Both depression and anxiety can contribute to sleep disturbances. Insufficient or poor-quality sleep can further exacerbate cognitive challenges by impairing alertness, reaction times, and overall cognitive performance. Addressing these cognitive challenges in pilots with depression and anxiety requires a comprehensive approach, including mental health support, targeted interventions, and a supportive organizational culture that promotes well-being and destigmatizes seeking help for mental health issues.

Excess deaths are defined as the number of additional deaths relative to those expected from pre-COVID-19-pandemic trends. We integrated data from: (a) epidemiological modeling using pre-pandemic all-cause mortality data, (b) discrepancies between media-reported death compensation claims and official reported mortality, and (c) the \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d public surveying. Our results point to an estimated 14,770 excess deaths [95% CI 9820\u201322,790] in Pune from March 2020 to December 2021, of which 9093 were officially counted as COVID-19 deaths. We further calculated the undercount factor\u2014the ratio of excess deaths to officially reported COVID-19 deaths. Our results point to an estimated undercount factor of 1.6 [95% CI 1.1\u20132.5]. Besides providing similar conclusions about excess deaths estimates across different methods, our study demonstrates\u00a0the utility of frugal methods such as the analysis of death compensation claims and the wisdom of crowds in estimating excess mortality.", "Method": "We combined five COVID-19-related excess deaths and undercount factors obtained from different methods: (a) the simple averaging technique, (b) the Farrington surveillance algorithm, (c) the overdispersed Poisson model, (d) analyzing media-reported death compensation claims, and (e) the\u00a0wisdom of crowds public surveying. We used a simple bootstrap to generate a plausible range of excess deaths and undercount factors for Pune. We first randomly sampled from the distributions generated by each of the five different methods. For all methods except the wisdom of crowds, we conducted sampling assuming a normal distribution. For the wisdom of crowds, we did not have any such assumption and conducted sampling from the raw survey data. We conducted 10,000 iterations of such random sampling with replacement and used the resulting 10,000 means to compute a 95% confidence interval.

We used patient fibroblasts, isogenic neurons, and post-mortem human brain samples from carriers with and without PRKN p.R275W to assess functional impact. Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence were used to study mitophagy activation, and mitophagy execution was analyzed by flow cytometry of the reporter mitoKeima.

Objective: This study explored the number and characteristics of community-based physiotherapy services in the Metropolitan City of Milan (Italy). Methods: Between April and May 2024, we distributed a structured, anonymous online survey about community physiotherapy services and users to all Directors of the Health and Social Care Professions Departments (DAPSS) in the Metropolitan City of Milan. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the number of community houses offering physiotherapy services, the specific intervention areas, and access modalities. Results: Six out of seven DAPSS Directors completed the survey (87%). Thirty-seven community houses were reported in the area, with fourteen of these offering physiotherapy services. In most of them, physiotherapy was a primary reason for access following a general practitioner\u2019s prescription. Five out of six responders reported that rehabilitation needs were mainly assessed by specialists in Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, with physiotherapists involved in the assessment process in two cases. Physiotherapists primarily handled the intervention phase, dealing mainly with orthopedic and neurological conditions. DAPSS Directors noted that additional physiotherapy initiatives focusing on prevention will be implemented. Conclusions: Physiotherapy services are becoming available in the Metropolitan City of Milan. However, more efforts are needed to facilitate access and ensure tailored assessment and effective interventions, particularly in preventive care. Future investigations should help to better define the number and the characteristics of the patients who can most benefit from this type of care, the number of sessions they need, and with what types of intervention; it would be also necessary to better define the communication network in the area that allows doctors, health professionals, and patients to be informed about this possibility.", "Method": "Descriptive statistics are presented as medians and interquartile ranges or absolute values, percentages, and frequencies, based on the nature of each variable.

However, SEM of sections on tape can only access the section surface, thereby limiting the axial resolution to the typical size of cellular vesicles with an order of magnitude lower than the acquired xy resolution. In contrast, serial-section electron tomography (ET), a transmission electron microscopy-based approach, yields isotropic voxels at full EM resolution, but requires deposition of sections on electron-stable thin and fragile films, thus making screening of large section libraries difficult and prone to section loss. To combine the strength of both approaches, we developed \u2018ATUM-Tomo, a hybrid method, where sections are first reversibly attached to plastic tape via a dissolvable coating, and after screening detached and transferred to the ET-compatible thin films.

It can be seen that green tea consumption may protect cognitive function by reducing AD pathology and improving anti-oxidative stress capacity. Green tea extract can also be used in lipid-bearing foods to delay lipid oxidation and to enhance the shelf-life of various food products. Dietary small molecules have become a modern food trend to add nutritional fortification to foods to increase the content of essential micro-nutrients and improve their nutritional quality. Cakes contain high carbohydrates and fats, while other nutrients, including proteins, minerals, and vitamins are fewer. Adding available, cheap, and nutritious edible plants to the cakes can enhance their health and nutritional safety. Many studies have shown that cake made with dietary small molecules powder is rich in protein, vitamins, and dietary fiber. It has high nutritional value and good taste. Recently, dairy products-derived snacks mixed with other plant materials have received extensive attention. For example, sweet and salty biscuits rich in calcium and protein were prepared by mixing dietary supplements. Fermented snacks made from cassava flour, soybean flour, and horseradish leaf powder rich in Vitamin A provided a new strategy for improving the diet of people with nutritional deficiencies. Snacks are one of the fastest-growing segments of the food industry. However, providing nutrition through the inclusion of fruits and vegetables in puffed snacks is a relatively new concept. Importantly, dietary supplements can be easily blended with oats to create extruded puffed snacks with a significantly improved nutrient profile compared to that of commercially available snacks. However, more attention should be paid to other phenolic compounds that are not regulated by current legislation and that have the potential to be used as food additives, such as phenolic acids and other classes of dietary products. Dietary small molecules could also be useful in cosmetics and could be used to prevent skin aging and cutaneous disorders since ROS are key drivers of aging. In addition, their ability to prevent lipid peroxidation allows them to extend shelf-life, as they do for foods. Dietary small molecules could also be used in cosmetic formulations such as body lotion, shampoo, hair restorer, hair color, and soaps. Since dietary small molecules are safe for consumption, their use as dietary supplements in natural, green, and healthy foods may soon become a trend in the food and drug development industry."}, "openai_response": "No"}, "11432175": {"title": "Pathological Involvement of Protein Phase Separation and Aggregation in Neurodegenerative Diseases", "summary": {"Abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are the leading cause of human disability and immensely reduce patients\u2019 life span and quality. The diseases are characterized by the functional loss of neuronal cells and share several common pathogenic mechanisms involving the malfunction, structural distortion, or aggregation of multiple key regulatory proteins. Cellular phase separation is the formation of biomolecular condensates that regulate numerous biological processes, including neuronal development and synaptic signaling transduction. Aberrant phase separation may cause protein aggregation that is a general phenomenon in the neuronal cells of patients suffering neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the pathological causes of common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Huntington\u2019s disease, among others. We discuss the regulation of key amyloidogenic proteins with an emphasis of their aberrant phase separation and aggregation. We also introduce the approaches as potential therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neurodegenerative diseases through intervening protein aggregation. Overall, this review consolidates the research findings of phase separation and aggregation caused by misfolded proteins in a context of neurodegenerative diseases.", "Method": "Overall, the treatment landscape for neurodegenerative diseases encounters various challenges. Primarily, conditions of AD and PD lack definitive cures but rely mainly on pharmaceuticals and rehabilitative treatments to relieve the symptoms and slow down the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

We measured protein levels in 74 patients on the day of admission and at 3 and 6 months after diagnosis. We determined protein concentrations by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using a panel of 269 heavy-labeled peptides. The predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were measured by routine pulmonary function testing.

Significant fold change was set to detect a 25% increase or decrease in protein abundance, which is based on the variation in our overall MRM experiment and is determined from QC samples that have been analyzed multiple times in prior studies and in the current work. The value reflects that approximately 70% of the quantified proteins have CVs less than 25%. The baseline in our longitudinal comparisons was the corresponding patient protein abundance at admission.

Dkk-1 upregulation, as well as the level of p-tau, was significantly greater in females than in males.

Four distinct demographic profiles were identified among TBI MOOC participants (education seekers, TBI-aware participants, TBI care providers and retirees) using a novel approach combining chi-squared tests and network modularity. Participants assigned to the TBI-aware and retiree profiles were most likely to complete all modules of the MOOC, and the TBI-aware profile was more highly represented in more recent iterations of the MOOC. Together, these data indicate that the TBI MOOC provided information to a wide range of people, and particularly engaged participants with personal or family experience of TBI.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the benefits of TC remain unclear. Our primary aims are to explore whether distinct age-related and TC-practice-related relationships can be identified with respect to either temporal or spatial (within/between-network connectivity) differences. This cross-sectional study examined recurrent neural network dynamics, employing an adaptive, data-driven thresholding approach to source-localized resting-state EEG data in order to identify meaningful connections across time-varying graphs, using both temporal and spatial features derived from a hidden Markov model (HMM). Mann\u2013Whitney U tests assessed between-group differences in temporal and spatial features by age and TC practice using either healthy younger adult controls (YACs, n = 15), healthy older adult controls (OACs, n = 15), or Tai Chi older adult practitioners (TCOAs, n = 15). Our results showed that aging is associated with decreased within-network and between-network functional connectivity (FC) across most brain networks. Conversely, TC practice appears to mitigate these age-related declines, showing increased FC within and between networks in older adults who practice TC compared to non-practicing older adults. These findings suggest that TC practice may abate age-related declines in neural network efficiency and stability, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological intervention for promoting healthy brain aging. This study furthers the triple-network model, showing that a balancing and reorientation of attention might be engaged not only through higher-order and top-down mechanisms (i.e., FPN/DAN) but also via the coupling of bottom-up, sensory\u2013motor (i.e., SMN/VIN) networks.", "Method": "Based on limited literature using similar approaches, we anticipated a large effect size (rank biserial r \u2248 0.75).

The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway leads to the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway has been suggested to not only facilitate inflammatory responses and the production of type I interferons (IFN), but also activate other cellular processes, such as apoptosis. It has not been studied, however, whether cGAS-STING activation is involved in the apoptosis induced by statin treatment in human colorectal cancer cells. In this study, we reported that lovastatin impaired mitochondrial function, including the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduction of oxygen consumption, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity, and mtDNA abundance in human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. The mitochondrial dysfunction markedly induced ROS production in mitochondria, whereas the defect in mitochondria respiration or depletion of mitochondria eliminated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage by lovastatin treatment was attenuated by mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (mitoQ). Upon DNA damage, mtDNA was released into the cytosol and bound to DNA sensor cGAS, thus activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to trigger a type I interferon response. This effect was not activated by nuclear DNA (nuDNA) or mitochondrial RNA, as the depletion of mitochondria compromised this effect, but not the knockdown of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1/melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (RIG-I/MDA5) adaptor or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Moreover, lovastatin-induced apoptosis was partly dependent on the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in HCT116 cells as the knockdown of cGAS or STING expression rescued cell viability and mitigated apoptosis. Similarly, the knockdown of cGAS or STING also attenuated the antitumor effect of lovastatin in the HCT116 xenograft model in vivo. Our findings suggest that lovastatin-induced apoptosis is at least partly mediated through the cGAS-STING signaling pathway by triggering mtDNA accumulation in the cytosol in human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells.", "Method": "Data are typically mean \u00b1 SD unless otherwise indicated and were analyzed by an unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test between two groups or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test as appropriate using GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 software (San Diego, CA, USA) (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; ns, no significance).

However, the underlying mechanism of cellular dysfunction within this projection between vHIP pyramidal neurons (PYR) and mPFC PYRs and parvalbumin interneurons (PV-IN) resulting in social memory impairments in Mecp2 KO mice has yet to be elucidated. We confirmed social memory (but not sociability) deficits in Mecp2 KO mice using a new 4-chamber social memory arena, designed to minimize the impact of the tethering to optical fibers required for simultaneous in vivo fiber photometry of Ca2+-sensor signals during social interactions. mPFC PYRs of wildtype (WT) mice showed increases in Ca2+ signal amplitude during explorations of a novel toy mouse and interactions with both familiar and novel mice, while PYRs of Mecp2 KO mice showed smaller Ca2+ signals during interactions only with live mice. On the other hand, mPFC PV-INs of Mecp2 KO mice showed larger Ca2+ signals during interactions with a familiar cage-mate compared to those signals in PYRs, a difference absent in the WT mice.

A proper PEG positioning technique and adequate post-positioning patient management and surveillance are the main protective factors, but the information on protective factors in the literature is much poorer. The aim of this study was to provide more information on PEG-related complications and mortality in geriatric patients treated with long-term enteral nutrition administered by PEG according to a specific home enteral nutrition (HEN) protocol. Methods: This was a retrospective study based on data from 136 elderly patients in whom PEG was positioned from 2017 to 2023 at the geriatric hospital IRCCS INRCA, Ancona (Italy), 88 of whom were treated with HEN. Data on PEG-related complications, duration of HEN, hospitalizations, and mortality were analyzed. Results: No complications were registered during or immediately after the PEG positioning. The prevalence of a major complication\u2014buried bumper\u2014was in the lower limit of the range reported in the literature (4.32%). The prevalence of minor complications such as peristomal leakage, inadvertent tube removal, and granulation tissue was higher than that reported in the literature (14.71%, 23.53%, 29.41%), while tube blockage and peristomal site infection were less frequent (8.82%, 38.23%).

It is therefore expected that gene expression can serve as a signal of a current or future phenotypic traits. In this paper we identify sets of genes, which we call Prognostic Transcriptomic Biomarkers (PTBs), that can predict firmness in Malus domestica (apple) fruits. In apples, all individuals of a cultivar are clones, and differences in fruit quality are due to the environment. The apples transcriptome responds to these differences in environment, which makes PTBs an attractive predictor of future fruit quality. PTBs have the potential to enhance supply chain efficiency, reduce crop loss, and provide higher and more consistent quality for consumers. However, several questions must be addressed. In this paper we answer the question of which of two common modeling approaches, Random Forest or ElasticNet, outperforms the other. We answer if PTBs with few genes are efficient at predicting traits. This is important because we need few genes to perform qPCR, and we answer the question if qPCR is a cost-effective assay as input for PTBs modeled using high-throughput RNA-seq. To do this, we conducted a pilot study using fruit texture in the \u2018Gala\u2019 variety of apples across several postharvest storage regiments. Fruit texture in \u2018Gala\u2019 apples is highly controllable by post-harvest treatments and is therefore a good candidate to explore the use of PTBs. We find that the RandomForest model is more consistent than an ElasticNet model and is predictive of firmness (r2 = 0.78) with as few as 15 genes. We also show that qPCR is reasonably consistent with RNA-seq in a follow up experiment. Results are promising for PTBs, yet more work is needed to ensure that PTBs are robust across various environmental conditions and storage treatments.", "Method": "Genes were selected from previous literature concentrating on loss of firmness and texture in apple fruits. If necessary, literature gene names were converted from other apple genomes nomenclature (i.e.) to GDDH13 using homology through OrthoFinder.

One is the suppression of the neuronal integrated stress response (ISR). Another is the targeted degradation of intraneuronal amyloid-beta (iA\u03b2) via the activation of BACE1 (Beta-site A\u03b2-protein-precursor Cleaving Enzyme) and/or BACE2. Both approaches are rational. Both are promising. Both have substantial intrinsic limitations. However, when combined in a carefully orchestrated manner into a composite therapy they display a prototypical synergy and constitute the apparently optimal, potentially most effective therapeutic strategy for AD.", "Method": "Some composite AD therapy scenarios, described above in Section 25 (for conventional AD; see Figure 13, panel A) and Section 33 (for unconventional AD; see Figure 23), entail the long-term activation of BACE1 and/or BACE2 following the withdrawal of inhibitors of the integrated stress response, i.e., under ISR conditions. In these scenarios, it is assumed that BACE1 and BACE2 continue to be produced under ISR conditions, when translation of the bulk of cellular proteins is suppressed as a result of the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. This may not be the case; the continuous production and presence of BACE1 and BACE2 in human neurons under ISR conditions remain to be ascertained (this can be achieved using the human neuronal cell-based AD model described in). On the other hand, BACE1 and BACE2 are certainly produced in neurons under regular (i.e., non-ISR) conditions. Therefore, even if the continuous production and, consequently, the cellular presence of BACE1 and BACE2 were affected by the ISR (both BACE1 and BACE2 are redundant in the production of iA\u03b2, independently of A\u03b2PP, and their absence would impede neither the generation of iA\u03b2 in the A\u03b2PP-independent pathway nor the progression of AD), the transient administration of their activators in the presence of ISR inhibitors (i.e., under non-ISR conditions), as described in Section 25 for conventional AD (see Figure 13, panel B) and Section 34 and Section 35 for unconventional AD (see Figure 24 and Figure 25), would remain fully applicable. In other words, BACE1 and BACE2 may not be produced in the neurons under ISR conditions. In such a case, their utilization as iA\u03b2 degradation agents would be feasible both for the prevention of conventional AD (when no neuronal ISR has yet been elicited; see Section 18 and Figure 9, panel A) and in the presence of ISR inhibitors (in circumstances when the neuronal ISR has already been elicited; the relevant sections and figures are listed in the section above). In this scenario, the inhibition of the neuronal ISR has a double duty. One, it disables the A\u03b2PP-independent iA\u03b2 generation pathway and, consequently, stops the influx of iA\u03b2 that is produced in this pathway. Two, by enabling the production of BACE1 and BACE2, it makes their utilization as iA\u03b2 degradation agents possible. Therefore, as an example, even if the rate of degradation of iA\u03b2 by activated BACE1 and/or BACE2 were to match or exceed that of its generation in the A\u03b2PP-independent pathway (as illustrated in Figure 9, panel B), the therapeutic utilization of both activities may still require the suppression of the neuronal ISR in order to enable their production."}, "openai_response": "Yes"}, "11227899": {"title": "The McCusker Subjective Cognitive Impairment Inventory (McSCI): a novel measure of perceived cognitive decline", "summary": {"Abstract": "Excellent reliability and construct validity suggest the McSCI-S estimates SCDs with acceptable accuracy while capturing self-reported concerns for various cognitive domains.

However, the question remains whether this anatomical resilience translates into functional resilience of the PRS neurons. Using neuroanatomy combined with whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, we investigated whether the unique spatial profile of the PRS was replicable in two knock-in mouse models of AD, APPNL-F/NL-F, and APPNL-F/MAPTHTAU and whether the intrinsic properties and morphological integrity of the PRS principal neurons was maintained compared to the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampal CA1 principal cells.

These observations were consistent in human post-mortem AD tissue. This spatial profile also correlated with functional resilience of strong burst firing PRS pyramidal cells that showed unaltered sub- and suprathreshold intrinsic biophysical membrane properties and gross morphology in the AD models that were similar to the properties of pyramidal cells recorded in age-matched wild-type mice (11\u201314 months). This was in contrast to the LEC and CA1 principal cells which showed altered subthreshold intrinsic properties such as a higher input resistance, longer membrane time constants and hyperexcitability in response to suprathreshold stimulation that correlated with atrophied dendrites in both AD models. In conclusion, our data show for the first time that the unique anatomical profile of the PRS constitutes a diffuse AD pathology that is correlated with the preservation of principal pyramidal cell intrinsic biophysical and morphological properties despite alteration of LEC and CA1 pyramidal cells in two distinct genetic models of AD.

There is limited research on the implementation processes of SP beyond the UK, hindering improvement and scale-up. This study aims to identify enablers and barriers of implementation of an SP program conducted in Portugal. A participatory and qualitative approach was used to assess the implementation of an SP program in health units. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with family doctors, social workers and representatives of community partners who participated in SP implementation. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to conduct thematic analysis.

Perceived challenges included raising users\u2019 awareness of SP and ensuring intervention adherence. Lack of preparedness for intersectoral working processes, including insufficient communication channels, limited community responses and the need for a more systematic collection of data on activities adherence and progress were also highlighted as barriers to SP implementation.

The introduction of ultrahigh-field MRI at 7\u00a0T (7\u00a0T) has shown promise in the diagnosis and evaluation of many cerebrovascular diseases. The increased signal-to-noise ratio and high susceptibility effect of 7\u00a0T MRI allow for higher spatial resolution and lesion conspicuousness, enabling assessment at different stroke stages and tissue levels. For instance, in the evaluation of lesion vessel reperfusion and whole-brain perfusion after acute stroke, 7\u00a0T MRI can visualize changes in supplying cerebral arteries after acute stroke in a non-invasive manner, and localize penumbra by mapping regional variations in cerebral perfusion. This capability surpasses current invasive DSA detection and CT techniques that require contrast injection. Additionally, in the early prediction of motor outcomes following stroke, 7\u00a0T MRI can more precisely assess microstructural lesions in white matter. Currently, even powerful anatomic imaging tools such as DTI can only demonstrate the gross fiber structure of white matter tracts, which are highly sensitive to microstructural changes but not specific about the type of changes (e.g., radial or axial).

No motor deficits were observed. The brain homogenates had an increased content of caspase-9, while the levels of \u03b1-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase decreased. PMU increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered the cellular permeability in cultured cells.

Various conditions can affect the vocal organs, leading to speech difficulties. Extensive research has been conducted by voice clinicians and academia in speech analysis. Previous approaches primarily focused on one particular task, such as differentiating between normal and dysphonic speech, classifying different voice disorders, or estimating the severity of voice disorders. Methods and procedures: This study proposes an approach that combines transfer learning and multitask learning (MTL) to simultaneously perform dysphonia classification and severity estimation. Both tasks use a shared representation; network is learned from these shared features. We employed five computer vision models and changed their architecture to support multitask learning. Additionally, we conducted binary \u2018healthy vs. dysphonia\u2019 and multiclass \u2018healthy vs. organic and functional dysphonia\u2019 classification using multitask learning, with the speaker\u2019s sex as an auxiliary task. Results: The proposed method achieved improved performance across all classification metrics compared to single-task learning (STL), which only performs classification or severity estimation. Specifically, the model achieved F1 scores of 93% and 90% in MTL and STL, respectively. Moreover, we observed considerable improvements in both classification tasks by evaluating beta values associated with the weight assigned to the sex-predicting auxiliary task. MTL achieved an accuracy of 77% compared to the STL score of 73.2%. However, the performance of severity estimation in MTL was comparable to STL. Conclusion: Our goal is to improve how voice pathologists and clinicians understand patients\u2019 conditions, make it easier to track their progress, and enhance the monitoring of vocal quality and treatment procedures.

The group found that despite the growing awareness of invisible disabilities, there is very limited research into the pros and cons of the invisibility of dementia. Our paper explores the SUNshiners research which stemmed from varied individual experiences of disclosing diagnoses. The group designed and developed a short survey to explore what the public knew about dementia and what they thought about the invisibility of dementia. A mixture of open- and closed-ended questions were used to gain meaningful data. A total of 347 people completed the survey (315 online and 32 paper-based), which was then co-analysed. The findings suggest that the majority of the public felt that the invisibility of dementia was negative; that knowing someone had dementia when first meeting them would be beneficial; that people living with dementia should maintain the right to vote; and that people living with dementia do not automatically require a consistent, regular carer. Common themes from the open-ended answers included capacity, severity of dementia, and access to support. The findings support the disclosure of dementia diagnosis; however, more action is needed to tackle stigmatised views, particularly as the SUNshiners felt that people do not have enough dementia education to support a positive disclosure experience.

Sensor derived digital measures of health, such as digital biomarkers or digital clinical outcome assessments, may be used to monitor health status or the risk of adverse events like falls. Current research around such digital measures has largely focused on exploring the use of few individual measures obtained through mobile devices. However, especially for long-term applications in older adults, this choice of technology may not be ideal and could further add to the digital divide. Moreover, large-scale systems biology approaches, like genomics, have already proven beneficial in precision medicine, making it plausible that the same could also hold for remote-health monitoring.

This type of prosodic modulation is important for social interaction, and it involves modifications in speech melody (intonational level) and articulation of consonants and vowels (segmental level). The present study investigates phonetic cues of prosodic modulations with respect to different focus structures in mild dysarthric PwPD as a function of levodopa. Acoustic and kinematic speech parameters of 25 PwPD were assessed in two motor conditions. Speech production data from PwPD were collected before (medication-OFF) and after levodopa intake (medication-ON) by means of 3-D electromagnetic articulography. On the acoustic level, intensity, pitch, and syllable durations were analyzed. On the kinematic level, movement duration and amplitude were investigated. Spatio-temporal modulations of speech parameters were examined and compared across three different prosodic focus structures (out-of-focus, broad focus, contrastive focus) to display varying speech demands. Overall, levodopa had beneficial effects on motor performance, speech loudness, and pitch modulation. Acoustic syllable durations and kinematic movement durations did not change, revealing no systematic effects of motor status on the temporal domain. In contrast, there were spatial modulations of the oral articulators: tongue tip movements were smaller and lower lip movements were larger in amplitude under levodopa, reflecting a more agile and efficient articulatory movement under levodopa. Thus, respiratory-phonatory functions and consonant production improved, while syllable duration and tongue body kinematics did not change.

For the fine motor skills domain, the typing errors outcome had a positively skewed distribution; therefore, log transformation was used, after adding a 0.1 constant to handle observations with zero errors; this transformation resulted in a symmetric distribution. Assessment scores at each time point or workstation are summarized in Tables\u00a02 and 3 along with P values from comparisons to the reference (footnotes detail additional findings for comparisons among days 2 to 4 or among the active workstations). To preserve an overall 5% type I error rate for each assessment score (for comparisons by day or comparisons by workstation), we corrected for multiple comparisons. There are 6 possible comparisons between the 4\u2009days or between the 4 workstations for each assessment; therefore, statistical significance was set to a P value <0.008 using the Bonferroni method (0.05/6=0.008). The significance level for assessing the effects of sequence or sequence\u2010by\u2010day interaction was set at 0.05.

However, the majority of EEG measurement devices currently available are expensive, bulky, uncomfortable to wear, and difficult to integrate with VR headsets. These limitations have hindered the development of related research fields. This study describes a low-cost (60.07 USD), small-sized, wireless, high-precision, low-power consumption 4-channel EEG measurement system (NeuroVista) for frontal area EEG measurements, which can be used with a VR headset, enabling EEG measurements in VR environments. The system has an input-referred noise of less than 0.9480 , a common mode rejection ratio of over 96\u00a0dB, a measurement resolution of less than 0.1 , a bandwidth of 0.5\u00a0\u223c\u00a045\u00a0Hz, and works at a sampling rate of 250\u00a0Hz. It also supports metal dry electrodes and includes a built-in analog bandpass filter, right-leg drive circuit, and built-in digital lowpass filter and notch filter, which can reduce noise during measurement. Researchers can reconstruct the electrode system to measure regions of interest according to their needs.", "Method": "The electrode system utilized in NeuroVista incorporates two different types of electrodes to fulfill specific functions, the elastic silver fabric electrodes used to measure EEG signals on the forehead (Fig. 14.b), and the silver-silver chloride electrodes clipped to the earlobe, serving as reference and driven-right-leg electrodes (Fig. 14.c). The surface of the silver fabric electrode is covered with a layer of silver fabric material filled with polyester fibers (Fig. 14.a). This structure provides good elasticity and ensures comfortable use for the wearer. The impedance of all electrodes is kept below  at . The electrode wires are of a dual-layer structure, with an outer layer of grounded copper foil shielding and an inner layer of signal wire. This design effectively reduces electromagnetic noise on the wires. Researchers have the flexibility to reconstruct the electrode system according to their specific needs. However, it is strongly recommended to incorporate a shielding layer to the conductors. This additional shielding layer will further enhance the system's ability to isolate external electromagnetic noise and maintain signal integrity.

Dietary intake of vitamin B6 was divided into quartiles ranging from the lowest (Q1) to the highest (Q4), with the lowest quartile acting as the reference group. Baseline continuous variables were analyzed using Student's t-test or nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, reporting the median and interquartile range for each group. Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze categorical variables among baseline characteristics, reporting frequency, and percentage for each group. In the logistic regression model, significant covariates from the univariate analysis were included to investigate the relationship between stroke and vitamin B6 consumption.

Model 3 was further adjusted to include BMI, PIR, marital status, educational level, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, MIPA, PHQ-9 depression score, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, total energy intake, WBC count, TC levels, and HDL levels, all based on Model 2. In model 3, all covariates with P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 in univariate analyses were included as potential confounders, allowing a more accurate assessment of the role of vitamin B6 in stroke disease.

To determine whether the association between vitamin B6 intake and stroke risk varied with age, sex, race, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, MIPA, PHQ-9 depression score, or arthritis, we conducted a subgroup analysis. In addition, we used a restricted cubic spline (RCS) model with four knots and took the dietary vitamin B6 intake value corresponding to an OR of 1 as the reference to further explore the nonlinear correlation between vitamin B6 intake and stroke risk.

The automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is more important due to the shortage of expert medical staff, because it reduces the burden on medical staff and enhances the results of diagnosis. A detailed analysis of specific brain disorder tissues is required to accurately diagnose the disease via segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Several studies have used the traditional machine-learning approaches to diagnose the disease from MRI, but manual extracted features are more complex, time-consuming, and require a huge amount of involvement from expert medical staff. The traditional approach does not provide an accurate diagnosis. Deep learning has automatic extraction features and optimizes the training process. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Alzheimer\u2019s disease dataset consists of four classes: mild demented (896 images), moderate demented (64 images), non-demented (3200 images), and very mild demented (2240 images).

However, it is also facing a reproducibility crisis, especially in healthcare. ML models that are carefully constructed from and evaluated on data from one part of the population may not generalize well on data from a different population group, or acquisition instrument settings and acquisition protocols. We tackle this problem in the context of neuroimaging of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), schizophrenia (SZ) and brain aging. We develop a weighted empirical risk minimization approach that optimally combines data from a source group, e.g., subjects are stratified by attributes such as sex, age group, race and clinical cohort to make predictions on a target group, e.g., other sex, age group, etc. using a small fraction (10%) of data from the target group. We apply this method to multi-source data of 15,363 individuals from 20 neuroimaging studies to build ML models for diagnosis of AD and SZ, and estimation of brain age. We found that this approach achieves substantially better accuracy than existing domain adaptation techniques: it obtains area under curve greater than 0.95 for AD classification, area under curve greater than 0.7 for SZ classification and mean absolute error less than 5 years for brain age prediction on all target groups, achieving robustness to variations of scanners, protocols, and demographic or clinical characteristics. In some cases, it is even better than training on all data from the target group, because it leverages the diversity and size of a larger training set. We also demonstrate the utility of our models for prognostic tasks such as predicting disease progression in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Critically, our brain age prediction models lead to new clinical insights regarding correlations with neurophysiological tests. In summary, we present a relatively simple methodology, along with ample experimental evidence, supporting the good generalization of ML models to new datasets and patient cohorts.", "Method": "The weighted-ERM procedure that we have discussed above can be thought of as an optimal mechanism to adapt a model trained on a source data to the target data as follows. Formally, in supervised learning using a dataset , the prediction on a test datum  is made by computing:  If the class of functions that we search over to find one candidate  (say, all possible linear predictors) is large, then this search is a computationally expensive endeavor at inference time. The \u201cweights\u201d  of a parametric model provide a classical way to work around this issue; we can think of the weights as a statistic of the dataset , i.e., . This statistic is sufficient to predict on samples within the training set . Using this for predicting on the test set by setting  entails a loss of generality and causes the gap between population risk and empirical risk in (6) but these weights conveniently separate the training and inference phases. This same argument holds for transfer learning where the weights  are learned using a source dataset and adapted, e.g., using mini-batch updates, to new data from the target dataset. Explicitly searching for the weights using both the source and target data, like we do in weighted-ERM in (8) is at least as good as adapting the weights trained on the source data. This is an instance of the data processing inequality. In other words, we can prove that the population risk of the solution obtained from (8) is at least as good as the one obtained using transfer learning techniques.

The second round involved transferring and fine-tuning, and the pre-trained discriminator (D) of the DCGAN learned more specific features for the classification task between AD and cognitively normal (CN). In the final round, the weights learned in the AD versus CN classification task were transferred to the MCI diagnosis. By highlighting brain regions with high prediction weights using 3D Grad-CAM, we further enhanced the model's interpretability. The proposed model achieved accuracies of 92.8%, 78.1%, and 76.4% in the classifications of AD versus CN, AD versus MCI, and MCI versus CN, respectively. The experimental results show that our proposed model avoids overfitting brought on by a paucity of sMRI data and enables the early detection of AD.", "Method": "Informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study."}, "openai_response": "No"}, "11195940": {"title": "Evaluating a mobile-based intervention to promote the mental health of informal dementia caregivers in Singapore: Study protocol for a pilot two-armed randomised controlled trial", "summary": {"Abstract": "ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05551533).

Methods: We examined young, middle-aged, and older individuals with and without hearing threshold loss using pure-tone (PT) audiometry, short-pulsed distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (pDPOAEs), auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs), speech comprehension (OLSA), and syllable discrimination in quiet and noise. Results: A noticeable decline of hearing sensitivity in extended high-frequency regions and its influence on low-frequency-induced ABRs was striking. When testing for differences in OLSA thresholds normalized for PT thresholds (PTTs), marked differences in speech comprehension ability exist not only in noise, but also in quiet, and they exist throughout the whole age range investigated. Listeners with poor speech comprehension in quiet exhibited a relatively lower pDPOAE and, thus, cochlear amplifier performance independent of PTT, smaller and delayed ABRs, and lower performance in vowel-phoneme discrimination below phase-locking limits (/o/-/u/). When OLSA was tested in noise, listeners with poor speech comprehension independent of PTT had larger pDPOAEs and, thus, cochlear amplifier performance, larger ASSR amplitudes, and higher uncomfortable loudness levels, all linked with lower performance of vowel-phoneme discrimination above the phase-locking limit (/i/-/y/). Conslusions: This study indicates that listening in noise in humans has a sizable disadvantage in envelope coding when basilar-membrane compression is compromised.

Interestingly, as AD progresses, less A\u03b242 is detectable in the plasma, a phenomenon thought to result from A\u03b2 becoming more aggregated in the brain and less A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 being transported from the brain to the plasma via the CSF. We propose that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in this transport. EVs are found in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid and carry diverse \u201ccargos\u201d of bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites) that dynamically reflect changes in the cells from which they are secreted. While A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 have been reported to be present in EVs, it is not known whether this interaction is specific for these peptides and thus whether amyloid-carrying EVs play a role in AD and/or serve as brain-specific biomarkers of the AD process. To determine if there is a specific interaction between A\u03b2 and EVs, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and discovered that A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 bind to EVs in a manner that is sequence specific, saturable, and endothermic. In addition, A\u03b2 incubation with EVs overnight yielded larger amounts of bound A\u03b2 peptide that was fibrillar in structure. These findings point to a specific amyloid\u2013EV interaction, a potential role for EVs in the transport of amyloid from the brain to the blood, and a role for this amyloid pool in the AD process.", "Method": "ThioT Protocol: Thioflavin T is a benzothiazole salt that can bind to beta-sheet structures found in amyloid. When bound to beta sheets, ThioT emits a fluorescent signal measurable at approximately 482 nm, versus the unbound form which is measured at 427 nm. This alteration in signal is measured to determine the presence of amyloid structure using this assay. To assay the beta-sheet structure of our A\u03b2, 10 \u03bcL of the starting peptides was diluted by adding 40 \u03bcL of D-PBS (1:5 dilution).

However, many patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and other related dementias have limited access to effective and individualized treatment. Care provision for dementia is often unequal, fragmented, and inefficient. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telemedicine use, which holds promising potential for addressing this important gap. In this narrative review, we aim to analyze and discuss how telemedicine can improve the quality of healthcare for AD and related dementias in a structured manner, based on the seven dimensions of healthcare quality defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), 2018: effectiveness, safety, people-centeredness, timeliness, equitability, integrated care, and efficiency. Materials and Methods: MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles investigating the role of telemedicine in the quality of care for patients with dementia. A narrative synthesis was based on the seven WHO dimensions. Results: Most studies indicate that telemedicine is a valuable tool for AD and related dementias: it can improve effectiveness (better access to specialized care, accurate diagnosis, evidence-based treatment, avoidance of preventable hospitalizations), timeliness (reduction of waiting times and unnecessary transportation), patient-centeredness (personalized care for needs and values), safety (appropriate treatment, reduction of infection risk),integrated care (interdisciplinary approach through several dementia-related services), efficiency (mainly cost-effectiveness) and equitability (overcoming geographical barriers, cultural diversities). However, digital illiteracy, legal and organizational issues, as well as limited awareness, are significant potential barriers.

We used the terms \u201cdementia\u201d, \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d, \u201ccognitive impairment\u201d, \u201ccognitive decline\u201d, \u201cmemory impairment\u201d, \u201chealthcare\u201d, \u201ccare\u201d, \u201cquality of care\u201d, \u201ctelemedicine\u201d, \u201ctelecare\u201d, \u201cteleneurology\u201d, \u201ctele-neurology\u201d, \u201cremote care\u201d, \u201ctelehealth\u201d, \u201caccess\u201d, \u201caccessibility\u201d, \u201ceffective\u201d, \u201ceffectiveness\u201d, \u201cpatient-centered\u201d, \u201cpersonalized\u201d, \u201cindividualized\u201d, \u201cintegrated\u201d, \u201csafe\u201d, \u201csafety\u201d, \u201cequal\u201d, \u201cequitability\u201d, \u201cequity\u201d, \u201ctimely\u201d, \u201ctimeliness\u201d, \u201cefficient\u201d, and \u201cefficiency\u201d in different combinations. Relevant articles were screened in the title and abstract, and relevant articles were read in their full form. We included articles mentioning the role of telemedicine in the quality of care of patients with AD or related forms of dementia in terms of effectiveness, safety, equitability, timeliness, patient-centeredness, efficiency, and integrated care. Studies without mentioning results, studies among patients under the age of 18 years old, or those investigating intellectual disability were excluded. Through the snowballing process, we also screened the bibliography of each selected article for potential additional studies to include most of the key recent evidence. For the purpose of this review, we organized our narrative synthesis of the included studies by the thematic categories defined by WHO on healthcare quality (1) effectiveness, (2) safety, (3) patient-centeredness, (4) timeliness, (5) equitability, (6) integrated care, and (7) efficiency."}, "openai_response": "No"}, "11089696": {"title": "Characterizing dysregulations via cell-cell communications in Alzheimer\u2019s brains using single-cell transcriptomes", "summary": {"Abstract": "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12868-024-00867-y.", "Method": "We calculated the ligand-gene regulatory scores using NicheNet (v1.1.1).

We test this multifocal Pupillary Frequency Tagging (mPFT) approach with young healthy participants (N = 36) and show that the spectral power of the sustained pupillary response elicited by 45 s of fixation of this multipartite stimulus reflects the relative contribution of each sector/frequency to the overall pupillary response. We further analyze the phase lag for each temporal frequency as well as several global features related to pupil state. Test/retest performed on a subset of participants indicates good repeatability. We also investigate the existence of structural (RNFL)/functional (mPFT) relationships. We then summarize the results of clinical studies conducted with mPFT on patients with neuropathies and retinopathies and show that the features derived from pupillary signal analyses, the distribution of spectral power in particular, are homologous to disease characteristics and allow for sorting patients from healthy participants with excellent sensitivity and specificity. This method thus appears as a convenient, objective, and fast tool for assessing the integrity of retino-pupillary circuits as well as idiosyncrasies and permits to objectively assess and follow-up retinopathies or neuropathies in a short amount of time.", "Method": "We also computed Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the averaged retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measured with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and the averaged spectral power to evaluate whether the functional pupillary responses depend upon the structural characteristics of the participants\u2019 retinae."}, "openai_response": "No"}}
