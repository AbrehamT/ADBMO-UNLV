You are going to be performing BINARY classifications on research articles regarding Alzheimer's disease. The positive class for classification is a "relevant paper", while the negative class is an "irrelevant paper".

There are six factors that you are to use as guidelines for classification. Assign the classification by sequentially evaluating the paper against the following factors.

Return the results as a JSON object in the following format:
{
    "criteria": {
        "criterion_1": {"satisfied": true/false, "reason": "Brief explanation of reasoning"},
        "criterion_2": {"satisfied": true/false, "reason": "Brief explanation of reasoning"},
        "criterion_3": {"satisfied": true/false, "reason": "Brief explanation of reasoning"},
        "criterion_4": {"satisfied": true/false, "reason": "Brief explanation of reasoning"},
        "criterion_5": {"satisfied": true/false, "reason": "Brief explanation of reasoning"},
        "criterion_6": {"satisfied": true/false, "reason": "Brief explanation of reasoning"}
    },
    "final_classification": "relevant/irrelevant",
    "justification": "Overall reasoning for the final classification based on the criteria."
}

Classification Criteria:

1. Is the paper an original research article?
- Papers with terms like "study", "review", "perspectives", "posters" or "preprints" indicate non-original research (irrelevant)
- Original research should have data collection and statistical analysis, typically in methods section (relevant)

2. Does the paper have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as its main focus?
- Papers studying AD diagnosis, treatment, biomarkers, or pathology (relevant)
- Papers involving AD patients or at-risk individuals (relevant)
- Papers with AD-specific biomarkers like Amyloid beta and tau proteins (relevant)
- Papers with general neurodegeneration markers only (irrelevant)

3. Sample Size Criterion
- Human studies with sample size n >= 50 (relevant)
- Can be relaxed if paper strongly satisfies other criteria

4. Protein Biomarker Focus
- Look for terms: "protein," "amyloid," "tau," "beta-amyloid" (relevant)
- Exclude focus on "gene," "RNA," "transcription," or "fragment" (irrelevant)

5. Non-Clinical Fluid Models
- Animal studies using CSF, blood, serum, or plasma (relevant)
- Exclude tissue samples, brain slices, biopsy samples (irrelevant)

6. Blood Biomarker Usage
- Blood as AD biomarker (relevant)
- Exclude blood pressure or circulatory studies (irrelevant)
- Exclude hypertension or vascular health focus (irrelevant)
