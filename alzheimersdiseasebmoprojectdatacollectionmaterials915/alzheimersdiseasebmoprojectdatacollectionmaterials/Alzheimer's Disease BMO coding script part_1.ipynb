    "--------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "_______\n",
    "\n",
    "PART 1:\n",
    "________\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a part of our Alzheimer’s disease research project, focusing on retrieving and analyzing academic articles from PubMed. Below is an explanation of the main sections and functionality within the script, aimed at helping future team members understand and continue this work seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Approach and Error Handling:\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "We began by using basic API calls to PubMed with the requests and json libraries. The goal was to search for articles related to \"Alzheimer's disease.\" However, this approach encountered errors while decoding the JSON responses, prompting a need for a more reliable method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition to Pymed Library:\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "To resolve the initial issues, we transitioned to using the pymed library, which offers a more robust interface for querying PubMed. This library allowed us to effectively search for and retrieve articles related to \"Alzheimer's disease\" by setting up a PubMed object and defining the appropriate search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Optimization:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "We experimented with various query versions, such as \"Alzheimer's\" and \"Alzheimer,\" to identify the most effective search terms. While the number of retrieved articles was similar, the specific articles varied. After these tests, we decided to standardize our query to \"Alzheimer's disease\" for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Article Count and Detail Retrieval:\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "The script includes functions to search for articles and retrieve their details. This process involved counting the number of articles available for our query and extracting relevant information. We encountered issues with incomplete data in some articles, which led us to refine our error handling and ensure only complete data was processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Search Techniques:\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "To improve the relevance of our search results, we discussed and implemented advanced search techniques. This included using boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and parentheses to refine our queries, focusing on specific areas such as fluid biomarkers and cerebrospinal fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Storage:\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "A significant milestone was storing 5000 articles into a CSV file, which demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of our data retrieval process. This step ensured that we could manage and analyze large volumes of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full-Text Access Implementation:\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "While PubMed primarily provides abstracts and references, we needed full-text articles for deeper analysis. The script includes functions to fetch full-text articles using PubMed Central (PMC) IDs. These functions send requests to PubMed Central, handle XML data parsing, and extract necessary article details, including titles, abstracts, publication years, keywords, MeSH terms, authors, and PMC IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "The notebook is designed to provide a comprehensive approach to data retrieval and processing from PubMed, tailored specifically for Alzheimer’s disease research. It includes robust error handling, optimized search queries, and full-text access capabilities, ensuring that future team members can easily understand and build upon this work."

      "Title: Gazing Beyond the Horizon: A Systematic Review Unveiling the Theranostic Potential of Quantum Dots in Alzheimer's Disease.\n",
      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, poses a significant healthcare challenge worldwide. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein drives neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation, perpetuating disease progression. Despite advancements in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms, treatment hurdles persist, emphasizing the need for innovative intervention strategies. Quantum dots (QDs) emerge as promising nanotechnological tools with unique photo-physical properties, offering advantages over conventional imaging modalities. This systematic review endeavors to elucidate the theranostic potential of QDs in AD by synthesizing preclinical and clinical evidence. A comprehensive search across electronic databases yielded 20 eligible studies investigating the diagnostic, therapeutic, or combined theranostic applications of various QDs in AD. The findings unveil the diverse roles of QDs, including inhibiting Aβ and tau aggregation, modulating amyloidogenesis pathways, restoring membrane fluidity, and enabling simultaneous detection of AD biomarkers. The review highlights the potential of QDs in targeting multiple pathological hallmarks, delivering therapeutic payloads across the blood-brain barrier, and facilitating real-time imaging and high-throughput screening. While promising, challenges such as biocompatibility, surface modifications, and clinical translation warrant further investigation. This systematic review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the theranostic potential of QDs in AD, paving the way for translational research and clinical implementation.\n",

      "Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with increased mortality risk (MR), reflecting progression of motor and nonmotor symptoms. PD psychosis (PDP), a common nonmotor symptom, increases with prolonged disease and elevates the MR of PD even further. Pimavanserin is the only FDA-approved treatment for PDP.

Among five comparisons of pimavanserin with atypical antipsychotics, two were large (n = 21,719; n = 21,975), representative, Medicare-database studies, which demonstrated comparable or lower all-cause pimavanserin MR. Among three pimavanserin versus control studies, two reported lower or comparable pimavanserin MR and one, long-term care study reported higher MR for pimavanserin versus non-pimavanserin treated patients with unknown PDP status. Two open-label extensions reported pimavanserin mortality rates of 6.45 and 18.8 deaths per 100 patient-years, which are comparable to, or lower than, mortality rates for PD, PDP, and other atypical antipsychotics.

      "Abstract: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a nonmotile, obligate anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium known for its association with periodontal disease and its involvement in systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease. This bacterium produces several virulence factors, including capsules, fimbriae, lipopolysaccharides, proteolytic enzymes and hemagglutinins. A comparative genomic analysis revealed the open pangenome of P. gingivalis and identified complete type IV secretion systems (T4SS) in strain KCOM2805 and almost complete type VI secretion systems (T6SS) in strains KCOM2798 and ATCC49417, which is a new discovery as previous studies did not find the proteins involved in secretion systems IV and VI. Conservation of some virulence factors between different strains was observed, regardless of their genetic diversity and origin. In addition, we performed for the first time a reconstruction analysis of the gene regulatory network (GRN), identifying transcription factors and proteins involved in the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis. In particular, QseB regulates the expression of hemagglutinin and arginine deaminase, while Rex may suppress the release of gingipain through interactions with PorV and the formatum/nitrate transporter. Our study highlights the central role of conserved virulence factors and regulatory pathways, particularly QseB and Rex, in P. gingivalis and provides insights into potential therapeutic targets.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is broadly characterized by neurodegeneration, pathology accumulation, and cognitive decline. There is considerable variation in the progression of clinical symptoms and pathology in humans, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in the study of AD. To address this, we analyze cell composition and amyloid-beta deposition of 6- and 14-month-old AD-BXD mouse brains. We utilize the analytical QUINT workflow- a suite of software designed to support atlas-based quantification, which we expand to deliver a highly effective method for registering and quantifying cell and pathology changes in diverse disease models. In applying the expanded QUINT workflow, we quantify near-global age-related increases in microglia, astrocytes, and amyloid-beta, and we identify strain-specific regional variation in neuron load. To understand how individual differences in cell composition affect the interpretation of bulk gene expression in AD, we combine hippocampal immunohistochemistry analyses with bulk RNA-sequencing data. This approach allows us to categorize genes whose expression changes in response to AD in a cell and/or pathology load-dependent manner. Ultimately, our study demonstrates the use of the QUINT workflow to standardize the quantification of immunohistochemistry data in diverse mice, - providing valuable insights into regional variation in cellular load and amyloid deposition in the AD-BXD model.\n",

      "Abstract: Growing evidence suggests an association between osteocalcin (OCN), a peptide derived from bone and involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the causality of these associations and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. We utilized a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal effects of blood OCN levels on AD and to assess the potential involvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Independent instrumental variables strongly associated (P < 5E-08) with blood OCN levels were obtained from three independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the human blood proteome (N = 3301 to 35,892). Two distinct summary statistics datasets on AD from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP, N = 63,926) and a recent study including familial-proxy AD patients (FPAD, N = 472,868) were used. Summary-level data for fasting glucose (FG), 2h-glucose post-challenge, fasting insulin, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides were incorporated to evaluate the potential role of glucose and lipid metabolism in mediating the impact of OCN on AD risk. Our findings consistently demonstrate a significantly negative correlation between genetically determined blood OCN levels and the risk of AD (IGAP: odds ratio [OR, 95%CI] = 0.83[0.72-0.96], P = 0.013; FPAD: OR = 0.81 [0.70-0.93], P = 0.002). Similar estimates with the same trend direction were obtained using other statistical approaches. Furthermore, employing multivariable MR analysis, we found that the causal relationship between OCN levels and AD was disappeared after adjustment of FG and TC (IGAP: OR = 0.97[0.80-1.17], P = 0.753; FPAD: OR = 0.98 [0.84-1.15], P = 0.831). There were no apparent instances of horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out analysis showed good stability of the estimates. Our study provides evidence supporting a protective effect of blood OCN levels on AD, which is primarily mediated through regulating FG and TC levels. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying physio-pathological mechanisms.\n",

      "Title: Progress on early diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects both cognition and non-cognition functions. The disease follows a continuum, starting with preclinical stages, progressing to mild cognitive and behavioral impairment, ultimately leading to dementia. Early detection of AD is crucial for better diagnosis and more effective treatment. However, the current AD diagnostic tests of biomarkers using cerebrospinal fluid and/or brain imaging are invasive or expensive, and mostly are still not able to detect early disease state. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic techniques with higher sensitivity and specificity during the preclinical stages of AD. Various non-cognitive manifestations, including behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbances, sensory dysfunctions, and physical changes, have been observed in the preclinical AD stage before occurrence of notable cognitive decline. Recent research advances have identified several biofluid biomarkers as early indicators of AD. This review focuses on these non-cognitive changes and newly discovered biomarkers in AD, specifically addressing the preclinical stages of the disease. Furthermore, it is of importance to explore the potential for developing a predictive system or network to forecast disease onset and progression at the early stage of AD.\n",

      "Abstract: This study investigated trajectory profiles and the association of concentrations of the biomarkers neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with clinical outcome at 1 year and 10-15 years after a severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI).\n",
      "This study included patients with sTBI at the Neurointensive Care Unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. The injury was regarded as severe if patients had a Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 corresponding to Reaction Level Scale ≥ 4. CSF was collected from a ventricular catheter during a 2-week period. Concentrations of NfL and GFAP in CSF were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to assess the 1-year and 10-15-year outcomes. After adjustment for age and previous neurological diseases, logistic regression was performed for the outcomes GOS 1 (dead) or GOS 2-5 (alive) and GOS 1-3 (poor) or GOS 4-5 (good) versus the independent continuous variables (NfL and GFAP).\n",
      "Fifty-three patients with sTBI were investigated; forty-seven adults are presented in the article, and six children (aged 7-18 years) are described in Supplement 1. The CSF concentrations of NfL gradually increased over 2 weeks post trauma, whereas GFAP concentrations peaked on days 3-4. Increasing NfL and GFAP CSF concentrations increased the odds of GOS 1-3 outcome 1 year after trauma (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-2.80, p = 0.025; and OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.09-2.37, p = 0.016, respectively). Similarly, increasing CSF concentrations of NfL and GFAP increased the odds for GOS 1-3 outcome 10-15 years after trauma (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05-3.96, p = 0.035; and OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02-2.00, p = 0.040).\n",
      "This study shows that initial high concentrations of NfL and GFAP in CSF are both associated with higher odds for GOS 1-3 outcome 1 year and 10-15 years after an sTBI, implicating its potential usage as a prognostic marker in the future.\n",

A comparative genomic analysis revealed the open pangenome of P. gingivalis and identified complete type IV secretion systems (T4SS) in strain KCOM2805 and almost complete type VI secretion systems (T6SS) in strains KCOM2798 and ATCC49417, which is a new discovery as previous studies did not find the proteins involved in secretion systems IV and VI. Conservation of some virulence factors between different strains was observed, regardless of their genetic diversity and origin. In addition, we performed for the first time a reconstruction analysis of the gene regulatory network (GRN), identifying transcription factors and proteins involved in the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis. In particular, QseB regulates the expression of hemagglutinin and arginine deaminase, while Rex may suppress the release of gingipain through interactions with PorV and the formatum/nitrate transporter. Our study highlights the central role of conserved virulence factors and regulatory pathways, particularly QseB and Rex, in P. gingivalis and provides insights into potential therapeutic targets.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is broadly characterized by neurodegeneration, pathology accumulation, and cognitive decline. There is considerable variation in the progression of clinical symptoms and pathology in humans, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in the study of AD. To address this, we analyze cell composition and amyloid-beta deposition of 6- and 14-month-old AD-BXD mouse brains. We utilize the analytical QUINT workflow- a suite of software designed to support atlas-based quantification, which we expand to deliver a highly effective method for registering and quantifying cell and pathology changes in diverse disease models. In applying the expanded QUINT workflow, we quantify near-global age-related increases in microglia, astrocytes, and amyloid-beta, and we identify strain-specific regional variation in neuron load. To understand how individual differences in cell composition affect the interpretation of bulk gene expression in AD, we combine hippocampal immunohistochemistry analyses with bulk RNA-sequencing data. This approach allows us to categorize genes whose expression changes in response to AD in a cell and/or pathology load-dependent manner. Ultimately, our study demonstrates the use of the QUINT workflow to standardize the quantification of immunohistochemistry data in diverse mice, - providing valuable insights into regional variation in cellular load and amyloid deposition in the AD-BXD model.\n",

      "Abstract: Growing evidence suggests an association between osteocalcin (OCN), a peptide derived from bone and involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the causality of these associations and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. We utilized a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal effects of blood OCN levels on AD and to assess the potential involvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Independent instrumental variables strongly associated (P < 5E-08) with blood OCN levels were obtained from three independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the human blood proteome (N = 3301 to 35,892). Two distinct summary statistics datasets on AD from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP, N = 63,926) and a recent study including familial-proxy AD patients (FPAD, N = 472,868) were used. Summary-level data for fasting glucose (FG), 2h-glucose post-challenge, fasting insulin, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides were incorporated to evaluate the potential role of glucose and lipid metabolism in mediating the impact of OCN on AD risk. Our findings consistently demonstrate a significantly negative correlation between genetically determined blood OCN levels and the risk of AD (IGAP: odds ratio [OR, 95%CI] = 0.83[0.72-0.96], P = 0.013; FPAD: OR = 0.81 [0.70-0.93], P = 0.002). Similar estimates with the same trend direction were obtained using other statistical approaches. Furthermore, employing multivariable MR analysis, we found that the causal relationship between OCN levels and AD was disappeared after adjustment of FG and TC (IGAP: OR = 0.97[0.80-1.17], P = 0.753; FPAD: OR = 0.98 [0.84-1.15], P = 0.831). There were no apparent instances of horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out analysis showed good stability of the estimates. Our study provides evidence supporting a protective effect of blood OCN levels on AD, which is primarily mediated through regulating FG and TC levels. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying physio-pathological mechanisms.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects both cognition and non-cognition functions. The disease follows a continuum, starting with preclinical stages, progressing to mild cognitive and behavioral impairment, ultimately leading to dementia. Early detection of AD is crucial for better diagnosis and more effective treatment. However, the current AD diagnostic tests of biomarkers using cerebrospinal fluid and/or brain imaging are invasive or expensive, and mostly are still not able to detect early disease state. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic techniques with higher sensitivity and specificity during the preclinical stages of AD. Various non-cognitive manifestations, including behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbances, sensory dysfunctions, and physical changes, have been observed in the preclinical AD stage before occurrence of notable cognitive decline. Recent research advances have identified several biofluid biomarkers as early indicators of AD. This review focuses on these non-cognitive changes and newly discovered biomarkers in AD, specifically addressing the preclinical stages of the disease. Furthermore, it is of importance to explore the potential for developing a predictive system or network to forecast disease onset and progression at the early stage of AD.\n",

      "Title: Consensus Paper: Cerebellum and Reward.\n",
      "Abstract: Cerebellum is a key-structure for the modulation of motor, cognitive, social and affective functions, contributing to automatic behaviours through interactions with the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and spinal cord. The predictive mechanisms used by the cerebellum cover not only sensorimotor functions but also reward-related tasks. Cerebellar circuits appear to encode temporal difference error and reward prediction error. From a chemical standpoint, cerebellar catecholamines modulate the rate of cerebellar-based cognitive learning, and mediate cerebellar contributions during complex behaviours. Reward processing and its associated emotions are tuned by the cerebellum which operates as a controller of adaptive homeostatic processes based on interoceptive and exteroceptive inputs. Lobules VI-VII/areas of the vermis are candidate regions for the cortico-subcortical signaling pathways associated with loss aversion and reward sensitivity, together with other nodes of the limbic circuitry. There is growing evidence that the cerebellum works as a hub of regional dysconnectivity across all mood states and that mental disorders involve the cerebellar circuitry, including mood and addiction disorders, and impaired eating behaviors where the cerebellum might be involved in longer time scales of prediction as compared to motor operations. Cerebellar patients exhibit aberrant social behaviour, showing aberrant impulsivity/compulsivity. The cerebellum is a master-piece of reward mechanisms, together with the striatum, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Critically, studies on reward processing reinforce our view that a fundamental role of the cerebellum is to construct internal models, perform predictions on the impact of future behaviour and compare what is predicted and what actually occurs.\n",

      "Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are part of the central nervous system (CNS) disorders that indicate their presence with neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and increased oxidative stress. Several pathophysiological factors and biomarkers are involved in this inflammatory process causing these neurological disorders. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) is an inflammation element, which induced transcription and appears to be one of the important players in physiological procedures, especially nervous disorders. NF-κB can impact upon series of intracellular actions and induce or inhibit many inflammation-related pathways. Multiple reports have focused on the modification of NF-κB activity, controlling its expression, translocation, and signaling pathway in neurodegenerative disorders and injuries like Alzheimer's disease (AD), spinal cord injuries (SCI), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Curcumin has been noted to be a popular anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory substance and is the foremost natural compound produced by turmeric. According to various studies, when playing an anti-inflammatory role, it interacts with several modulating proteins of long-standing disease signaling pathways and has an unprovocative consequence on pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review article determined to figure out curcumin's role in limiting the promotion of neurodegenerative disease via influencing the NF-κB signaling route. Preclinical studies were gathered from plenty of scientific platforms including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to evaluate this hypothesis. Extracted findings from the literature review explained the repressing impact of Curcumin on the NF-κB signaling pathway and, occasionally down-regulating the cytokine expression. Yet, there is an essential need for further analysis and specific clinical experiments to fully understand this subject.\n",

      "Abstract: Ancestral differences in genomic variation affect the regulation of gene expression; however, most gene expression studies have been limited to European ancestry samples or adjusted to identify ancestry-independent associations. Here, we instead examined the impact of genetic ancestry on gene expression and DNA methylation in the postmortem brain tissue of admixed Black American neurotypical individuals to identify ancestry-dependent and ancestry-independent contributions. Ancestry-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), transcripts and gene networks, while notably not implicating neurons, are enriched for genes related to the immune response and vascular tissue and explain up to 26% of heritability for ischemic stroke, 27% of heritability for Parkinson disease and 30% of heritability for Alzheimer's disease. Ancestry-associated DEGs also show general enrichment for the heritability of diverse immune-related traits but depletion for psychiatric-related traits. We also compared Black and non-Hispanic white Americans, confirming most ancestry-associated DEGs. Our results delineate the extent to which genetic ancestry affects differences in gene expression in the human brain and the implications for brain illness risk.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disease. Recently, studies have demonstrated the potential involvement of microRNA-181c-5p (miR-181c-5p) in AD. However, the mechanism through which miR-181c-5p is responsible for the onset and progression of this disease remains unclear, and our study aimed to explore this problem. Differential expression analysis of the AD dataset was performed to identify dysregulated genes. Based on hypergeometric analysis, AD differential the upstream regulation genes miR-181c-5p was found. We constructed a model where SH-SY5Y and BV2 cells were exposed to Aβ1-42 to simulate AD. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and IL-1β were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation levels of p-P38 and P38 were detected by Western blot. The level of apoptosis in BV2 cells under Aβ1-42 stress was exacerbated by miR-181c-5p mimic. Downregulated miR-181c-5p impaired the phagocytosis and degradation of Aβ by BV2 cells. The release of proinflammatory cytokines in BV2 cells with Aβ1-42 stress was alleviated by miR-181c-5p upregulation. Additionally, miR-181c-5p downregulation alleviated the phosphorylation of P38 in Aβ1-42-induced SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, miR-181c-5p improves the phagocytosis of Aβ by microglial cells in AD patients, thereby reducing neuroinflammation.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent form of dementia in the elderly. There is currently no effective treatment available for this disease. Diagnosis of AD typically relies on clinical manifestations and specific biomarkers. The present study investigated the impact of inducing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mice through the injection of lysozyme amyloids formed in the presence or absence of Bis (Indolyl) phenylmethane (BIPM) on alterations in plasma lipid profiles and liver enzyme activities. 24 adult Wistar rats were divided into control, Scopolamine, Lysozyme, BIPM groups and the blood samples were obtained from the groups for biochemical analysis. The findings of the study revealed significant changes in the plasma lipid profiles and liver enzyme markers of the Lysozyme group compared to the control group. The Lysozyme group exhibited elevated triglycerides (n = 6, P < 0.02) and LDL levels (n = 6, P < 0.02), reduced HDL (n = 6, P < 0.05) and cholesterol levels (n = 6, P < 0.02), and altered serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) level (n = 6, P < 0.05) compared to controls. While the level of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) did not change significantly compared to the control. BIPM groups showed no significant changes in lipid or enzyme levels compared to controls. Overall, our research has shown that BIPM has the ability to modify the structure of HEWL aggregates, thereby improving the detrimental effects associated with AD caused by these aggregates. Analyzing lipid profiles and liver enzyme markers presents a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic approaches. These alterations observed in the plasma may potentially serve as candidate biomarkers for diagnosing this disease.\n",

      "Abstract: The causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood, although many genes are known to be involved in this pathology. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, it is essential to identify the relationships between individual AD genes. Previous work has shown that the splice variant E of KLC1 (KLC1_vE) promotes AD, and that the CELF1 gene, which encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in splicing regulation, is at a risk locus for AD. Here, we identified a functional link between CELF1 and KLC1 in AD pathogenesis. Transcriptomic data from human samples from different ethnic groups revealed that CELF1 mRNA levels are low in AD brains, and the splicing pattern of KLC1 is strongly correlated with CELF1 expression levels. Specifically, KLC1_vE is negatively correlated with CELF1. Depletion and overexpression experiments in cultured cells demonstrated that the CELF1 protein down-regulates KLC1_vE. In a cross-linking and immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) database, CELF1 directly binds to KLC1 RNA, following which it likely modulates terminal exon usage, hence KLC1_vE formation. These findings reveal a new pathogenic pathway where a risk allele of CELF1 is associated with reduced CELF1 expression, which up-regulates KLC1_vE to promote AD.\n",

      "Abstract: Speech impediments are a prominent yet understudied symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). While the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established clinical target for treating motor symptoms, these interventions can lead to further worsening of speech. The interplay between dopaminergic medication, STN circuitry, and their downstream effects on speech in PD is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigate the effect of dopaminergic medication on STN circuitry and probe its association with speech and cognitive functions in PD patients. We found that changes in intrinsic functional connectivity of the STN were associated with alterations in speech functions in PD. Interestingly, this relationship was characterized by altered functional connectivity of the dorsolateral and ventromedial subdivisions of the STN with the language network. Crucially, medication-induced changes in functional connectivity between the STN's dorsolateral subdivision and key regions in the language network, including the left inferior frontal cortex and the left superior temporal gyrus, correlated with alterations on a standardized neuropsychological test requiring oral responses. This relation was not observed in the written version of the same test. Furthermore, changes in functional connectivity between STN and language regions predicted the medication's downstream effects on speech-related cognitive performance. These findings reveal a previously unidentified brain mechanism through which dopaminergic medication influences speech function in PD. Our study sheds light into the subcortical-cortical circuit mechanisms underlying impaired speech control in PD. The insights gained here could inform treatment strategies aimed at mitigating speech deficits in PD and enhancing the quality of life for affected individuals.\n",

      "Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has increasingly been used to study both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia (SZ). While most rs-fMRI studies being conducted in AD and SZ compare patients to healthy controls, it is also of interest to directly compare AD and SZ patients with each other to identify potential biomarkers shared between the disorders. However, comparing patient groups collected in different studies can be challenging due to potential confounds, such as differences in the patient's age, scan protocols, etc. In this study, we compared and contrasted resting-state functional network connectivity (rs-FNC) of 162 patients with AD and late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), 181 schizophrenia patients, and 315 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. We used confounder-controlled rs-FNC and applied machine learning algorithms (including support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor) and deep learning models (i.e., fully-connected neural networks) to classify subjects in binary and three-class categories according to their diagnosis labels (e.g., AD, SZ, and CN). Our statistical analysis revealed that FNC between the following network pairs is stronger in AD compared to SZ: subcortical-cerebellum, subcortical-cognitive control, cognitive control-cerebellum, and visual-sensory motor networks. On the other hand, FNC is stronger in SZ than AD for the following network pairs: subcortical-visual, subcortical-auditory, subcortical-sensory motor, cerebellum-visual, sensory motor-cognitive control, and within the cerebellum networks. Furthermore, we observed that while AD and SZ disorders each have unique FNC abnormalities, they also share some common functional abnormalities that can be due to similar neurobiological mechanisms or genetic factors contributing to these disorders' development. Moreover, we achieved an accuracy of 85% in classifying subjects into AD and SZ where default mode, visual, and subcortical networks contributed the most to the classification and accuracy of 68% in classifying subjects into AD, SZ, and CN with the subcortical domain appearing as the most contributing features to the three-way classification. Finally, our findings indicated that for all classification tasks, except AD vs. SZ, males are more predictable than females.\n",

      "Abstract: Pericyte dysfunction severely undermines cerebrovascular integrity and exacerbates neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, pericyte-targeted therapy is a yet-untapped frontier for AD. Inspired by the elevation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in pericyte lesions, we fabricated a multifunctional nanoprodrug by conjugating the hybrid peptide VLC, a fusion of the VCAM-1 high-affinity peptide VHS and the neuroprotective apolipoprotein mimetic peptide COG1410, to curcumin (Cur) through phenylboronic ester bond (VLC@Cur-NPs) to alleviate complex pericyte-related pathological changes. Importantly, VLC@Cur-NPs effectively homed to pericyte lesions via VLC and released their contents upon ROS stimulation to maximize their regulatory effects. Consequently, VLC@Cur-NPs markedly increased pericyte regeneration to form a positive feedback loop and thus improved neurovascular function and ultimately alleviated memory defects in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We present a promising therapeutic strategy for AD that can precisely modulate pericytes and has the potential to treat other cerebrovascular diseases.\n",

      "Title: Exploring Curcumin-Loaded Lipid-Based Nanomedicine as Efficient Targeted Therapy for Alzheimer's Diseases.\n",
      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition currently with 47 million people suffering from it globally. AD might have many reasons such as genetic issues, environmental factors, and Aβ accumulation, which is the biomarker of the disease. Since the primary reason is unknown, there is no targeted treatment at the moment, but ongoing research aims to slow its progression by managing amyloid-beta peptide production rather than symptomatic improvement. Since phytochemicals have been demonstrated to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, they may target multiple pathological factors and can reduce the risk of the disease. Curcumin, as a phytochemical found in turmeric known for its antioxidant, free radical scavenging properties, and as an antiamyloid in treating AD, has come under investigation. Although its low bioavailability limits its efficacy, a prominent drug delivery system (DDS) is desired to overcome it. Hence, the potency of lipid-based nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin (LNPs-CUR) is considered in this study as a promising DDS. In vivo studies in animal models indicate LNPs-CUR effectively slow amyloid plaque formation, leading to cognitive enhancement and reduced toxicity compared to free CUR. However, a deeper understanding of CUR's pharmacokinetics and safety profile is crucial before LNPs-CUR can be considered as a medicine. Future investigations may explore the combination of NPs with other therapeutic agents to increase their efficacy in AD cases. This review provides the current position of CUR in the AD therapy paradigm, the DDS suggestions for CUR, and the previous research from the point of analytical view focused on the advantages and challenges.\n",

      "Abstract: Gantenerumab, a human monoclonal antibody (mAb), has been thought of as a potential agent to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) by specifically targeting regions of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide sequence. Aβ protein accumulation in the brain leads to amyloid plaques, causing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal damage, and neurotransmitter dysfunction, thereby causing cognitive decline in AD. Gantenerumab involves disrupting Aβ aggregation and promoting the breakdown of larger Aβ aggregates into smaller fragments, which facilitates the action of Aβ-degrading enzymes in the brain, thus slowing down the progression of AD. Moreover, Gantenerumab acts as an opsonin, coating Aβ plaques and enhancing their recognition by immune cells, which, combined with its ability to improve the activity of microglia, makes it an intriguing candidate for promoting Aβ plaque clearance. Indeed, the multifaceted effects of Gantenerumab, including Aβ disaggregation, enhanced immune recognition, and improved microglia activity, may position it as a promising therapeutic approach for AD. Of note, reports suggest that Gantenerumab, albeit its capacity to reduce or eliminate Aβ, has not demonstrated effectiveness in reducing cognitive decline. This review, after providing an overview of immunotherapy approaches that target Aβ in AD, explores the efficacy of Gantenerumab in reducing Aβ levels and cognitive decline.\n",

      "Abstract: JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202501000-00033/figure1/v/2024-05-14T021156Z/r/image-tiff The E3 ubiquitin ligase, carboxyl terminus of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) interacting protein (CHIP), also functions as a co-chaperone and plays a crucial role in the protein quality control system. In this study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of overexpressed CHIP on Alzheimer's disease. We used an adeno-associated virus vector that can cross the blood-brain barrier to mediate CHIP overexpression in APP/PS1 mouse brain. CHIP overexpression significantly ameliorated the performance of APP/PS1 mice in the Morris water maze and nest building tests, reduced amyloid-β plaques, and decreased the expression of both amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau. CHIP also alleviated the concentration of microglia and astrocytes around plaques. In APP/PS1 mice of a younger age, CHIP overexpression promoted an increase in ADAM10 expression and inhibited β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, insulin degrading enzyme, and neprilysin expression. Levels of HSP70 and HSP40, which have functional relevance to CHIP, were also increased. Single nuclei transcriptome sequencing in the hippocampus of CHIP overexpressed mice showed that the lysosomal pathway and oligodendrocyte-related biological processes were up-regulated, which may also reflect a potential mechanism for the neuroprotective effect of CHIP. Our research shows that CHIP effectively reduces the behavior and pathological manifestations of APP/PS1 mice. Indeed, overexpression of CHIP could be a beneficial approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "Abstract: γ-Secretase, called \"the proteasome of the membrane,\" is a membrane-embedded protease complex that cleaves 150+ peptide substrates with central roles in biology and medicine, including amyloid precursor protein and the Notch family of cell-surface receptors. Mutations in γ-secretase and amyloid precursor protein lead to early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. γ-Secretase has thus served as a critical drug target for treating familial Alzheimer's disease and the more common late-onset Alzheimer's disease as well. However, critical gaps remain in understanding the mechanisms of processive proteolysis of substrates, the effects of familial Alzheimer's disease mutations, and allosteric modulation of substrate cleavage by γ-secretase. In this review, we focus on recent studies of structural dynamic mechanisms of γ-secretase. Different mechanisms, including the \"Fit-Stay-Trim,\" \"Sliding-Unwinding,\" and \"Tilting-Unwinding,\" have been proposed for substrate proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein by γ-secretase based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. While an incorrect registry of the Notch1 substrate was identified in the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Notch1-bound γ-secretase, molecular dynamics simulations on a resolved model of Notch1-bound γ-secretase that was reconstructed using the amyloid precursor protein-bound γ-secretase as a template successfully captured γ-secretase activation for proper cleavages of both wildtype and mutant Notch, being consistent with biochemical experimental findings. The approach could be potentially applied to decipher the processing mechanisms of various substrates by γ-secretase. In addition, controversy over the effects of familial Alzheimer's disease mutations, particularly the issue of whether they stabilize or destabilize γ-secretase-substrate complexes, is discussed. Finally, an outlook is provided for future studies of γ-secretase, including pathways of substrate binding and product release, effects of modulators on familial Alzheimer's disease mutations of the γ-secretase-substrate complexes. Comprehensive understanding of the functional mechanisms of γ-secretase will greatly facilitate the rational design of effective drug molecules for treating familial Alzheimer's disease and perhaps Alzheimer's disease in general.\n",

      "Abstract: High-mobility group box 1 was first discovered in the calf thymus as a DNA-binding nuclear protein and has been widely studied in diverse fields, including neurology and neuroscience. High-mobility group box 1 in the extracellular space functions as a pro-inflammatory damage-associated molecular pattern, which has been proven to play an important role in a wide variety of central nervous system disorders such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Several drugs that inhibit high-mobility group box 1 as a damage-associated molecular pattern, such as glycyrrhizin, ethyl pyruvate, and neutralizing anti-high-mobility group box 1 antibodies, are commonly used to target high-mobility group box 1 activity in central nervous system disorders. Although it is commonly known for its detrimental inflammatory effect, high-mobility group box 1 has also been shown to have beneficial pro-regenerative roles in central nervous system disorders. In this narrative review, we provide a brief summary of the history of high-mobility group box 1 research and its characterization as a damage-associated molecular pattern, its downstream receptors, and intracellular signaling pathways, how high-mobility group box 1 exerts the repair-favoring roles in general and in the central nervous system, and clues on how to differentiate the pro-regenerative from the pro-inflammatory role. Research targeting high-mobility group box 1 in the central nervous system may benefit from differentiating between the two functions rather than overall suppression of high-mobility group box 1.\n",

      "Title: Targeting epigenetic mechanisms in amyloid-β-mediated Alzheimer's pathophysiology: unveiling therapeutic potential.\n",
      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a prominent chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by a gradual decline in memory leading to dementia. Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease is associated with accumulating various amyloid-β oligomers in the brain, influenced by complex genetic and environmental factors. The memory and cognitive deficits observed during the prodromal and mild cognitive impairment phases of Alzheimer's disease are believed to primarily result from synaptic dysfunction. Throughout life, environmental factors can lead to enduring changes in gene expression and the emergence of brain disorders. These changes, known as epigenetic modifications, also play a crucial role in regulating the formation of synapses and their adaptability in response to neuronal activity. In this context, we highlight recent advances in understanding the roles played by key components of the epigenetic machinery, specifically DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs, in the development of Alzheimer's disease, synaptic function, and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Moreover, we explore various strategies, including enriched environments, exposure to non-invasive brain stimulation, and the use of pharmacological agents, aimed at improving synaptic function and enhancing long-term potentiation, a process integral to epigenetic mechanisms. Lastly, we deliberate on the development of effective epigenetic agents and safe therapeutic approaches for managing Alzheimer's disease. We suggest that addressing Alzheimer's disease may require distinct tailored epigenetic drugs targeting different disease stages or pathways rather than relying on a single drug.\n",

      "Abstract: Over the last decades, the evidence accumulated about the existence of respiratory supercomplexes (SCs) has changed our understanding of the mitochondrial electron transport chain organization, giving rise to the proposal of the \"plasticity model.\" This model postulates the coexistence of different proportions of SCs and complexes depending on the tissue or the cellular metabolic status. The dynamic nature of the assembly in SCs would allow cells to optimize the use of available fuels and the efficiency of electron transfer, minimizing reactive oxygen species generation and favoring the ability of cells to adapt to environmental changes. More recently, abnormalities in SC assembly have been reported in different diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), Barth Syndrome, Leigh syndrome, or cancer. The role of SC assembly alterations in disease progression still needs to be confirmed. Nevertheless, the availability of enough amounts of samples to determine the SC assembly status is often a challenge. This happens with biopsy or tissue samples that are small or have to be divided for multiple analyses, with cell cultures that have slow growth or come from microfluidic devices, with some primary cultures or rare cells, or when the effect of particular costly treatments has to be analyzed (with nanoparticles, very expensive compounds, etc.). In these cases, an efficient and easy-to-apply method is required. This paper presents a method adapted to obtain enriched mitochondrial fractions from small amounts of cells or tissues to analyze the structure and function of mitochondrial SCs by native electrophoresis followed by in-gel activity assays or western blot.\n",

      "Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating condition that affects more than 300 million people worldwide. Current treatments are based on a trial-and-error approach, and reliable biomarkers are needed for more informed and personalized treatment solutions. One of the potential biomarkers, gamma-frequency (30-80 Hz) brainwaves, are hypothesized to originate from the excitatory-inhibitory interaction between the pyramidal cells and interneurons. The imbalance between this interaction is described as a crucial pathological mechanism in neuropsychiatric conditions, including MDD, and the modulation of this pathological interaction has been investigated as a potential target. Previous studies attempted to induce gamma activity in the brain using rhythmic light and sound stimuli (GENUS - Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory stimuli) that resulted in neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and animal models. Here, we investigate the antidepressant, cognitive, and electrophysiological effects of the novel light therapy approach using 40 Hz masked flickering light for patients diagnosed with MDD.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative condition that has various levels of effect on one's memory. It is thought to be caused by a buildup of protein in small fluid-filled spaces in the brain called perivascular spaces (PVS). The PVS often takes on the form of an annular region around arteries and is used as a protein-clearing system for the brain. To analyze the modes of mass transfer in the PVS, a digitized scan of a mouse brain PVS segment was meshed and used for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies. Tandem analyses were then carried out and compared between the mouse PVS section and a cylinder with commensurate dimensionless parameters and hydraulic resistance. The geometry pair was used to first validate the CFD model and then assess mass transfer in various advection states: no flow, constant flow, sinusoidal flow, sinusoidal flow with zero net solvent flux, and an anatomically correct asymmetrical periodic flow. Two mass transfer situations were considered, one being a protein build-up and the other being a protein blend-down. The results showed that, for all the flows in question and both protein scenarios, there was nearly no protein clearance benefit by the anatomically correct PVS geometry. Surprisingly, solute blend-down was diffusion-dominated even for high Peclet numbers. Findings herein lead to the conclusion that minimal risk would be incurred by incorporating PVS geometry into existing reduce-order modeling arterial networks.\n",

      "Abstract: Reducing fibrous aggregates of protein tau is a possible strategy for halting progression of Alzheimer's dis-ease (AD). Previously we found that in vitro the D-peptide D-TLKIVWC disassembles tau fibrils from AD brains (AD-tau) into benign segments with no energy source present beyond ambient thermal agitation. This disassembly by a short peptide was unexpected, given that AD-tau is sufficiently stable to withstand disas-sembly in boiling SDS detergent. To consider D peptide-mediated disassembly as a potential therapeutic for AD, it is essential to understand the mechanism and energy source of the disassembly action. We find as-sembly of D-peptides into amyloid-like fibrils is essential for tau fibril disassembly. Cryo-EM and atomic force microscopy reveal that these D-peptide fibrils have a right-handed twist and embrace tau fibrils which have a left-handed twist. In binding to the AD-tau fibril, the oppositely twisted D-peptide fibril produces a strain, which is relieved by the disassembly of both fibrils. This strain-relief mechanism appears to operate in other examples of amyloid fibril disassembly and provides a new direction for the development of first-in-class therapeutics for amyloid diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: We examined the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTPRS) in the context of Alzheimer's disease and synaptic integrity. Publicly available datasets (BRAINEAC, ROSMAP, ADC1) and a cohort of asymptomatic but \"at risk\" individuals (PREVENT-AD) were used to explore the relationship between PTPRS and various Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. We identified that PTPRS rs10415488 variant C shows features of neuroprotection against early tau pathology and synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This single nucleotide polymorphism correlated with higher PTPRS transcript abundance and lower P-tau181 and GAP-43 levels in the CSF. In the brain, PTPRS protein abundance was significantly correlated with the quantity of two markers of synaptic integrity: SNAP25 and SYT-1. We also found the presence of sexual dimorphism for PTPRS, with higher CSF concentrations in males than females. Male carriers for variant C were found to have a 10-month delay in the onset of AD. We thus conclude that PTPRS acts as a neuroprotective receptor in Alzheimer's disease. Its protective effect is most important in males, in whom it postpones the age of onset of the disease.\n",

      "Abstract: Rare variants, comprising a vast majority of human genetic variations, are likely to have more deleterious impact on human diseases compared to common variants. Here we present carrier statistic, a statistical framework to prioritize disease-related rare variants by integrating gene expression data. By quantifying the impact of rare variants on gene expression, carrier statistic can prioritize those rare variants that have large functional consequence in the diseased patients. Through simulation studies and analyzing real multi-omics dataset, we demonstrated that carrier statistic is applicable in studies with limited sample size (a few hundreds) and achieves substantially higher sensitivity than existing rare variants association methods. Application to Alzheimer's disease reveals 16 rare variants within 15 genes with extreme carrier statistics. We also found strong excess of rare variants among the top prioritized genes in diseased patients compared to that in healthy individuals. The carrier statistic method can be applied to various rare variant types and is adaptable to other omics data modalities, offering a powerful tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Despite the presence of significant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles, some cognitively normal elderly individuals do not inevitably develop dementia. These findings give rise to the notion of cognitive 'resilience', suggesting maintained cognitive function despite the presence of AD neuropathology, highlighting the influence of factors beyond classical pathology. Cortical astroglial inflammation, a ubiquitous feature of symptomatic AD, shows a strong correlation with cognitive impairment severity, potentially contributing to the diversity of clinical presentations. However, noninvasively imaging neuroinflammation, particularly astrogliosis, using MRI remains a significant challenge. Here we sought to address this challenge and to leverage multidimensional (MD) MRI, a powerful approach that combines relaxation with diffusion MR contrasts, to map cortical astrogliosis in the human brain by accessing sub-voxel information. Our goal was to test whether MD-MRI can map astroglial pathology in the cerebral cortex, and if so, whether it can distinguish cognitive resiliency from dementia in the presence of hallmark AD neuropathological changes. We adopted a multimodal approach by integrating histological and MRI analyses using human postmortem brain samples. \n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to progressive neurodegeneration and dementia. AD primarily affects older adults with neuropathological changes including amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. We have previously demonstrated that systemic treatment with stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (SCF+G-CSF), reduces Aβ load, increases Aβ uptake by activated microglia and monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mac), reduces neuroinflammation, and restores dendrites and synapses in the brains of aged APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. However, the mechanisms underlying SCF+G-CSF-enhanced brain repair in aged APP/PS1 mice remain unclear. This study used a transcriptomic approach to explore the mechanisms by which SCF+G-CSF treatment alters the functions of microglia and Mo/Mac in the brains of 28-month-old APP/PS1 mice. After 5-day injections of SCF+G-CSF, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on CD11b \n",

      "Abstract: Neurodegeneration is a process leading to the progressive loss of structure and functions of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease have shown many common points at the subcellular level. Neurons are metabolically active cells and need a high amount of energy. Mitochondria are known as the energy synthesis center for cells, involved in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate by oxidative phosphorylation. Rather than just being an energy synthesis center, it has critical importance for many cellular functions such as calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, cell growth, and apoptosis. In the process of mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular functions are disrupted and cells enter the apoptotic or necrotic pathway. Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4-trihydoxystilbene), a plant-derived polyphenol found in the seed of grapes, berries, peanuts, and wine, has many biological effects such as inhibition of lipid peroxidation, scavenging of free radicals, changes in eicosanoid synthesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity, and regulation of lipid metabolism. Through the reviewed literature, the current study investigated the protective role of resveratrol in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies show that resveratrol moderates mitochondrial function, redox status, and cellular dynamics in both \n",

      "Abstract: Many age-related neurological diseases still lack effective treatments, making their understanding a critical and urgent issue in the globally aging society. To overcome this challenge, an animal model that accurately mimics these diseases is essential. To date, many mouse models have been developed to induce age-related neurological diseases through genetic manipulation or drug administration. These models help in understanding disease mechanisms and finding potential therapeutic targets. However, some age-related neurological diseases cannot be fully replicated in human pathology due to the different aspects between humans and mice. Although zebrafish has recently come into focus as a promising model for studying aging, there are few genetic zebrafish models of the age-related neurological disease. This review compares the aging phenotypes of humans, mice, and zebrafish, and provides an overview of age-related neurological diseases that can be mimicked in mouse models and those that cannot. We presented the possibility that reproducing human cerebral small vessel diseases during aging might be difficult in mice, and zebrafish has potential to be another animal model of such diseases due to their similarity of aging phenotype to humans.\n",

      "Abstract: A growing number of studies apply deep neural networks (DNNs) to recordings of human electroencephalography (EEG) to identify a range of disorders. In many studies, EEG recordings are split into segments, and each segment is randomly assigned to the training or test set. As a consequence, data from individual subjects appears in both the training and the test set. Could high test-set accuracy reflect data leakage from subject-specific patterns in the data, rather than patterns that identify a disease? We address this question by testing the performance of DNN classifiers using segment-based holdout (in which segments from one subject can appear in both the training and test set), and comparing this to their performance using subject-based holdout (where all segments from one subject appear exclusively in either the training set or the test set). In two datasets (one classifying Alzheimer's disease, and the other classifying epileptic seizures), we find that performance on previously-unseen subjects is strongly overestimated when models are trained using segment-based holdout. Finally, we survey the literature and find that the majority of translational DNN-EEG studies use segment-based holdout. Most published DNN-EEG studies may dramatically overestimate their classification performance on new subjects.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disease, precipitating cognitive impairment and even memory loss. Amyloid biomarkers have been extensively used in the diagnosis of AD. However, amyloid proteins offer limited information about the disease process and accurate diagnosis depends on the presence of a substantial accumulation of amyloid deposition which significantly impedes the early screening of AD. In this study, we have combined plasma proteomics with an ensemble learning model (CatBoost) to develop a cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic method for AD. A longitudinal panel has been identified that can serve as reliable biomarkers across the entire progression of AD. Simultaneously, we have developed a neural network algorithm that utilizes plasma proteins to detect stages of Alzheimer's disease. Based on the developed longitudinal panel, the CatBoost model achieved an area under the operating curve of at least 0.90 in distinguishing mild cognitive impairment from cognitively normal. The neural network model was utilized for the detection of three stages of AD, and the results demonstrated that the neural network model exhibited an accuracy as high as 0.83, surpassing that of the traditional machine learning model.\n",

Despite their distinct etiologies, patients suffering from AD or SCZ share a common burden of disrupted memory functions unattended by current therapies. Recent preclinical analyses highlight cell-type-specific contributions of parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs), particularly the plasticity of their cellular excitability, towards intact neuronal network function (cell-to-network plasticity) and memory performance. Here we argue that deficits of PVI cell-to-network plasticity may underlie memory deficits in AD and SCZ, and we explore two therapeutic avenues: the targeting of PVI-specific neuromodulation, including by neuropeptides, and the recruitment of network synchrony in the gamma frequency range (40 Hz) by external stimulation. We finally propose that these approaches be merged under consideration of recent insights into human brain physiology.\n",

      "Abstract: Our innate immune system uses pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as a first line of defense to detect microbial ligands and initiate an immune response. Viral nucleic acids are key ligands for the activation of many PRRs and the induction of downstream inflammatory and antiviral effects. Initially it was thought that endogenous (self) nucleic acids rarely activated these PRRs, however emerging evidence indicates that endogenous nucleic acids are able to activate host PRRs in homeostasis and disease. In fact, many regulatory mechanisms are in place to finely control and regulate sensing of self-nucleic acids by PRRs. Sensing of self-nucleic acids is particularly important in the brain, as perturbations to nucleic acid sensing commonly leads to neuropathology. This review will highlight the role of nucleic acid sensors in the brain, both in disease and homeostasis. We also indicate the source of endogenous stimulatory nucleic acids where known and summarize future directions for the study of this growing field.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Previous studies have identified the critical role of astrocytes in the progression of AD. The focus of this study revolves around clarifying the regulatory mechanism of the STAT3/EZH2/BAI1 axis in astrocytes in AD. We successfully developed a rat model of AD, and measured the learning and cognitive ability of the rats by Morris water maze experiment. HE and Nissl's staining were used for histomorphological identification of the rat hippocampus. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to detect astrocyte activation and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1) expression in rat hippocampal tissue, respectively. The role of STAT3/EZH2/BAI1 regulating axis in astrocyte activation and neuronal cell apoptosis was verified by establishing the co-culture system of astrocytes and nerve cells in vitro. Western Blot (WB) was used to detect the expression of associated proteins, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect astrocyte neurotrophic factor secretion. Hochest/PI staining and flow cytometry were used to observe neuronal apoptosis. Compared with the sham group, AD rats showed significantly decreased cognitive and learning abilities, noticeable hippocampal tissue damage, and significantly low levels of BAI1 expression. In in vitro models, BAI1 was found to inhibit astrocyte activation and enhance the secretion of neurotrophins, resulting in decrease of neurone apoptosis. The regulation of BAI1 by the STAT3/EZH2 axis was shown to affect astrocyte activation and neuronal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, this study represents the pioneering discovery that regulated by the STAT3/EZH2 axis, BAI1 suppresses astrocyte activation, thus reducing neuronal apoptosis.\n",

      "Abstract: As part of the classical renin-angiotensin system, the peptidase angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) makes angiotensin II which has myriad effects on systemic cardiovascular function, inflammation, and cellular proliferation. Less well known is that macrophages and neutrophils make ACE in response to immune activation which has marked effects on myeloid cell function independent of angiotensin II. Here, we discuss both classical (angiotensin) and non-classical functions of ACE and highlight mice called ACE 10/10 in which genetic manipulation increases ACE expression by macrophages and makes these mice much more resistant to models of tumors, infection, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. In another model called NeuACE mice, neutrophils make increased ACE and these mice are much more resistant to infection. In contrast, ACE inhibitors reduce neutrophil killing of bacteria in mice and humans. Increased expression of ACE induces a marked increase in macrophage oxidative metabolism, particularly mitochondrial oxidation of lipids, secondary to increased PPARα expression, and results in increased myeloid cell ATP. ACE present in sperm has a similar metabolic effect and the lack of ACE activity in these cells reduces both sperm motility and fertilization capacity. These non-classical effects of ACE are not due to the actions of angiotensin II but to an unknown molecule, probably a peptide, that triggers a profound change in myeloid cell metabolism and function. Purifying and characterizing this peptide could offer a new treatment for several diseases and prove potentially lucrative.\n",

      "Abstract: Currently, there are no effective therapeutic agents available to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, edaravone dexborneol (EDB), a novel composite agent used to treat acute ischemic stroke, has recently been shown to exert efficacious neuroprotective effects. However, whether EDB can ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD currently remains unclear. To this end, we explored the effects of EDB on AD and its potential mechanisms using an AD animal model (male APP/PS1 mice) treated with EDB for 10 weeks starting at 6 months of age. Subsequent analyses revealed that EDB-treated APP/PS1 mice exhibited improved cognitive abilities compared to untreated APP/PS1 mice. Administration of EDB in APP/PS1 mice further alleviated neuropathological alterations of the hippocampus, including Aβ deposition, pyramidal cell karyopyknosis, and oxidative damage, and significantly decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and COX-2 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Transcriptome sequencing analysis demonstrated the critical role of the inflammatory reaction in EDB treatment in APP/PS1 mice, indicating that the alleviation of the inflammatory reaction by EDB in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice was linked to the action of the TREM2/TLR4/MAPK signaling pathway. Further in vitro investigations showed that EDB suppressed neuroinflammation in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells by inhibiting the TLR4/MAPK signaling pathway and upregulating TREM2 expression. Thus, the findings of the present study demonstrate that EDB is a promising therapeutic agent for AD-related cognitive dysfunction.\n",

      "Abstract: Synaptic dysfunction is highly correlated with cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementia syndrome in the elderly. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two primary forms of synaptic plasticity with opposite direction of synaptic efficiency change. Both LTD and LTD are considered to mediate the cellular process of learning and memory. Substantial studies demonstrate AD-associated deficiency of both LTP and LTD. Meanwhile, the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying impairment of synaptic plasticity, particularly LTD, are poorly understood. By taking advantage of the novel transgenic mouse models recently developed in our lab, here we aimed to investigate the roles of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central molecular senor that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, in regulation of LTD phenotypes in AD. We found that brain-specific suppression of the AMPKα1 isoform (but not AMPKα2 isoform) was able to alleviate mGluR-LTD deficits in APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Moreover, suppression of either AMPKα isoform failed to alleviate AD-related NMDAR-dependent LTD deficits. Taken together with our recent studies on roles of AMPK signaling in AD pathophysiology, the data indicate isoform-specific roles of AMPK in mediating AD-associated synaptic and cognitive impairments.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairments, and behavioral changes. The presence of abnormal beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain is known to be associated with AD. However, current limitations of imaging technology hinder the direct detection of these substances. Consequently, researchers are exploring alternative approaches, such as indirect assessments involving monitoring brain signals, cognitive decline levels, and blood biomarkers. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of integrating genetic information into these approaches to enhance early detection and diagnosis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of AD pathology beyond the constraints of existing imaging methods. Our study utilized electroencephalography (EEG) signals, genotypes, and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) as features for machine learning models. We compared the performance of gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to determine the optimal model. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between EEG signals and clinical manifestations, demonstrating the ability to distinguish the complexity of AD from other diseases by using genetic information. By integrating EEG with genetic data in an SVM model, we achieved exceptional classification performance, with an accuracy of 0.920 and an area under the curve of 0.916. This study presents a novel approach of utilizing real-time EEG data and genetic background information for multimodal machine learning. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of this concept, providing deeper insights into the actual condition of patients with AD and overcoming the limitations associated with single-oriented data.\n",

      "Abstract: Carbon dots (CDs) are carbon nano materials (CNMs) that find use across several biological applications because of their water solubility, biocompatible nature, eco-friendliness, and ease of synthesis. Additionally, their physiochemical properties can be chemically tuned for further optimization towards specific applications. Here, we investigate the efficacy of C70-derived Graphene Acid Quantum Dots (GAQDs) in mitigating the transformation of soluble, monomeric Hen Egg-White Lysozyme (HEWL) to mature fibrils during its amyloidogenic trajectory. Our findings reveal that GAQDs exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of HEWL fibril formation (up to 70 % at 5 mg/mL) without affecting mitochondrial membrane potential or inducing apoptosis at the same density. Furthermore, GAQDs scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS); achieving a 50 % reduction in ROS levels at a mere 100 µg/mL when exposed to a standard free radical generator. GAQDs were not only found to be biocompatible with a human neuroblastoma-derived SHSY-5Y cell line but also rescued the cells from rotenone-induced apoptosis. The GAQD-tolerance of SHSY-5Y cells coupled with their ability to restitute cells from rotenone-dependent apoptosis, when taken in conjunction with the biocompatibility data, indicate that GAQDs possess neuroprotective potential. The data position this class of CNMs as promising candidates for resolving aberrant cellular outputs that associate with the advent and progress of multifactorial neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's diseases (AD) wherein environmental causes are implicated (95 % etiology). The data suggest that GAQDs are a multifunctional carbon-based sustainable nano-platform at the intersection of nanotechnology and neuroprotection for advancing green chemistry-derived, sustainable healthcare solutions.\n",

      "Title: Periodontopathogen-Related Cell Autophagy-A Double-Edged Sword.\n",
      "Abstract: The periodontium is a highly organized ecosystem, and the imbalance between oral microorganisms and host defense leads to periodontal diseases. The periodontal pathogens, mainly Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, colonize the periodontal niches or enter the blood circulation, resulting in periodontal tissue destruction and distal organ damage. This phenomenon links periodontitis with various systemic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumors, steatohepatitis, and Alzheimer's disease. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular self-degradation process essential for eliminating internalized pathogens. Nowadays, increasing studies have been carried out in cells derived from periodontal tissues, immune system, and distant organs to investigate the relationship between periodontal pathogen infection and autophagy-related activities. On one hand, as a vital part of innate and adaptive immunity, autophagy actively participates in host resistance to periodontal bacterial infection. On the other, certain periodontal pathogens exploit autophagic vesicles or pathways to evade immune surveillance, therefore achieving survival within host cells. This review provides an overview of the autophagy process and focuses on periodontopathogen-related autophagy and their involvements in cells of different tissue origins, so as to comprehensively understand the role of autophagy in the occurrence and development of periodontal diseases and various periodontitis-associated systemic illnesses.\n",

      "Abstract: An extensive exploration of lacrimal fluid molecular biomarkers in understanding and diagnosing a spectrum of ocular and systemic diseases is presented. The chapter provides an overview of lacrimal fluid composition, elucidating the roles of proteins, lipids, metabolites, and nucleic acids within the tear film. Pooled versus single-tear analysis is discussed to underline the benefits and challenges associated with both approaches, offering insights into optimal strategies for tear sample analysis. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of tear collection methods is presented, with a focus on Schirmer's test strips and microcapillary tubes methods. Alternative tear collection techniques are also explored, shedding light on their applicability and advantages. Variability factors, including age, sex, and diurnal fluctuations, are examined in the context of their impact on tear biomarker analysis. The main body of the chapter is dedicated to discussing specific biomarkers associated with ocular discomfort and a wide array of ocular diseases. From dry eye disease and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy to keratoconus, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, the intricate relationship between molecular biomarkers and these conditions is thoroughly dissected. Expanding beyond ocular pathologies, the chapter explores the applicability of tear biomarkers in diagnosing systemic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. This broader perspective underscores the potential of lacrimal fluid analysis in offering non-invasive diagnostic tools for conditions with far-reaching implications.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is prevalent around the world, yet our understanding of the disease is still very limited. Recent work suggests that the cornerstone of AD may include the inflammation that accompanies it. Failure of a normal pro-inflammatory immune response to resolve may lead to persistent central inflammation that contributes to unsuccessful clearance of amyloid-beta plaques as they form, neuronal death, and ultimately cognitive decline. Individual metabolic, and dietary (lipid) profiles can differentially regulate this inflammatory process with aging, obesity, poor diet, early life stress and other inflammatory factors contributing to a greater risk of developing AD. Here, we integrate evidence for the interface between these factors, and how they contribute to a pro-inflammatory brain milieu. In particular, we discuss the importance of appropriate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the diet for the metabolism of specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs); raising the possibility for dietary strategies to improve AD outlook.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurological condition that has become a leading cause of cognitive decline in elder individuals. Hardly any effective medication has been developed to halt the progression of AD due to the disease's complexity. Several theories have been put forward to clarify the mechanisms underlying AD etiology. The identification of amyloid plaques as a hallmark of AD has sparked the development of numerous drugs targeting the players involved in the amyloidogenic pathway, such as the β-site of amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) blockers. Over the last ten years, preclinical and early experimental research has led several pharmaceutical companies to prioritize producing BACE1 inhibitors. Despite all these efforts, earlier discovered inhibitors were discontinued in consideration of another second-generation small molecules and recent BACE1 antagonists failed in the final stages of clinical trials because of the complications associated either with toxicity or effectiveness. In addition to discussing the difficulties associated with development of BACE1 inhibitors, this review aims to provide an overview of BACE1 and offer perspectives on the causes behind the failure of five recent BACE1 inhibitors, that would be beneficial for choosing effective treatment approaches in the future.\n",

      "Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a rapidly growing neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) and aggregation of α-synuclein. Its aetiology involves a multifaceted interplay among genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. We integrated brain gene expression data from PD patients to construct a comprehensive regulatory network encompassing messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) and, for the first time, RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Expression data from the SN of PD patients and controls were systematically selected from public databases to identify combined differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Brain co-expression analysis revealed modules comprising significant DEGs that function cooperatively. The relationships among co-expressed DEGs, miRNAs, circRNAs, and RBPs revealed an intricate competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network responsible for post-transcriptional dysregulation in PD. Many genes in the ceRNA network, including the TOMM20 and HMGCR genes, overlap with the most relevant genes in our previous Alzheimer's disease-associated ceRNA network, suggesting common underlying mechanisms between both conditions. Moreover, in the ceRNA subnetwork, the RBP Aly/REF export factor (ALYREF), which acts as an RNA 5-methylcytosine(m5C)-binding protein, stood out. Our data sheds new light on the potential role of brain ceRNA networks in PD pathogenesis.\n",

      "Abstract: The abnormal deposition of tau protein is one of the critical causes of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, there has been great interest in the use of essential oils and volatile compounds in aromatherapy for treating AD, since volatile compounds can directly reach the brain through intranasal administration. The volatile compounds α-asarone (ASA) and β-caryophyllene (BCP) have revealed various important neuroprotective properties, useful in treating AD. In this study, the volatile compounds ASA and BCP were assessed for their effectiveness in preventing tau fibrillation, disassembly of pre-formed tau fibrils, and disaggregation of tau aggregates. SDS-PAGE and AFM analyses revealed that ASA and BCP inhibited tau fibrillation/aggregation and decreased the mean size of tau oligomers. Tau samples treated with ASA and BCP, showed a reduction in ThT and ANS fluorescence intensities, and a decrease in the β-sheet content. Additionally, ASA and BCP disassembled the pre-formed tau fibrils to the granular and linear oligomeric intermediates. Treatment of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with tau samples treated with ASA and BCP, revealed protective effects as shown by reduced toxicity of the cells, due to the inhibition of tau fibrillation/aggregation. Overall, ASA and BCP appeared to be promising therapeutic candidates for AD.\n",

We evaluated mRNA expression of the PAR4 gene F2RL3 in human brain and global cognitive performance in participants with and without cognitive impairment or dementia. Data were acquired from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). F2RL3 mRNA was elevated in AD cases and was associated with worse retrospective longitudinal cognitive performance. Moreover, F2RL3 expression interacted with clinical AD diagnosis on longitudinal cognition whereas this relationship was attenuated in individuals without cognitive impairment. Additionally, when adjusting for the effects of AD neuropathology, F2RL3 expression remained a significant predictor of cognitive decline. F2RL3 expression correlated positively with transcript levels of proinflammatory markers including TNFα, IL-1β, NFκB, and fibrinogen α/β/γ. Together, these results reveal that F2RL3 mRNA expression is associated with multiple AD-relevant outcomes and its encoded product, PAR4, may play a role in disease pathogenesis.\n",

      "Title: E3 ligases and DUBs target ferroptosis: A potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "Abstract: Ferroptosis is a form of cell death mediated by iron and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Recent studies have provided compelling evidence to support the involvement of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate ferroptosis in NDDs may improve disease management. Ferroptosis is regulated by multiple mechanisms, and different degradation pathways, including autophagy and the ubiquitinproteasome system (UPS), orchestrate the complex ferroptosis response by directly or indirectly regulating iron accumulation or lipid peroxidation. Ubiquitination plays a crucial role as a protein posttranslational modification in driving ferroptosis. Notably, E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are key enzymes in the ubiquitin system, and their dysregulation is closely linked to the progression of NDDs. A growing body of evidence highlights the role of ubiquitin system enzymes in regulating ferroptosis sensitivity. However, reports on the interaction between ferroptosis and ubiquitin signaling in NDDs are scarce. In this review, we first provide a brief overview of the biological processes and roles of the UPS, summarize the core molecular mechanisms and potential biological functions of ferroptosis, and explore the pathophysiological relevance and therapeutic implications of ferroptosis in NDDs. In addition, reviewing the roles of E3s and DUBs in regulating ferroptosis in NDDs aims to provide new insights and strategies for the treatment of NDDs. These include E3- and DUB-targeted drugs and ferroptosis inhibitors, which can be used to prevent and ameliorate the progression of NDDs.\n",

      "Title: Upregulation of neuronal ER-phagy improves organismal fitness and alleviates APP toxicity.\n",
      "Abstract: ER-phagy, a selective autophagy targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for lysosomal degradation through cargo receptors, plays a critical role in ER quality control and is linked to various diseases. However, its physiological and pathological roles remain largely unclear due to a lack of animal model studies. This study establishes Drosophila as an in vivo ER-phagy model. Starvation triggers ER-phagy across multiple fly tissues. Disturbing ER-phagy by either globally upregulating or downregulating ER-phagy receptors, Atl or Rtnl1, harms the fly. Notably, moderate upregulation of ER-phagy in fly brains by overexpressing Atl or Rtnl1 significantly attenuates age-associated neurodegenerations. Furthermore, in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP), impaired ER-phagy is observed. Enhancing ER-phagy in the APP-expressing fly brain facilitates APP degradation, significantly alleviating disease symptoms. Therefore, our findings suggest that modulating ER-phagy may offer a therapeutic strategy to treat aging and diseases associated with ER protein aggregation.\n",

      "Title: Identification of high-performing antibodies for the reliable detection of Tau proteoforms by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.\n",
      "Abstract: Antibodies are essential research tools whose performance directly impacts research conclusions and reproducibility. Owing to its central role in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, hundreds of distinct antibody clones have been developed against the microtubule-associated protein Tau and its multiple proteoforms. Despite this breadth of offer, limited understanding of their performance and poor antibody selectivity have hindered research progress. Here, we validate a large panel of Tau antibodies by Western blot (79 reagents) and immunohistochemistry (35 reagents). We address the reagents' ability to detect the target proteoform, selectivity, the impact of protein phosphorylation on antibody binding and performance in human brain samples. While most antibodies detected Tau at high levels, many failed to detect it at lower, endogenous levels. By WB, non-selective binding to other proteins affected over half of the antibodies tested, with several cross-reacting with the related MAP2 protein, whereas the \"oligomeric Tau\" T22 antibody reacted with monomeric Tau by WB, thus calling into question its specificity to Tau oligomers. Despite the presumption that \"total\" Tau antibodies are agnostic to post-translational modifications, we found that phosphorylation partially inhibits binding for many such antibodies, including the popular Tau-5 clone. We further combine high-sensitivity reagents, mass-spectrometry proteomics and cDNA sequencing to demonstrate that presumptive Tau \"knockout\" human cells continue to express residual protein arising through exon skipping, providing evidence of previously unappreciated gene plasticity. Finally, probing of human brain samples with a large panel of antibodies revealed the presence of C-term-truncated versions of all main Tau brain isoforms in both control and tauopathy donors. Ultimately, we identify a validated panel of Tau antibodies that can be employed in Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry to reliably detect even low levels of Tau expression with high selectivity. This work represents an extensive resource that will enable the re-interpretation of published data, improve reproducibility in Tau research, and overall accelerate scientific progress.\n",

      "Title: Integrating the Patient's Voice into the Research Agenda for Treatment of Chemosensory Disorders.\n",
      "Abstract: World-wide some 658 million people were infected with COVID-19 and millions suffer from chemosensory impairment associated with long COVID. Current treatments for taste and smell disorders are limited. Involving patients has the potential to catalyze the dynamic exchange and development of new ideas and approaches to facilitate biomedical research and therapeutics. We assessed patients' perceptions of the efficacy of treatments for chemosensory impairment using an online questionnaire completed by 5,815 people in the U.S. Logistic regression determined variables predictive of reported treatment efficacy for patients aged 18-24, 25-39, 40-60 and 60+ yrs. who were treated with nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, smell training, theophylline, platelet rich plasma, and Omega 3. The most consistent predictor was age, with the majority of those 40-60 and 60+ reporting that nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse and smell training were only slightly effective or not effective at all. Many of these treatment strategies target regeneration and immune response, processes compromised by age. Only those under 40 reported more than slight efficacy of steroids or smell training. Findings emphasize the need to include patients of all ages in clinical trials. Older adults with olfactory impairment are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We speculate that olfactory impairment associated with long COVID introduces the potential for a significant rise in AD. Long COVID-associated chemosensory impairment increases the urgency for translational and clinical research on novel treatment strategies. Suggestions for high priority areas for epidemiological, basic, and clinical research on chemosensory impairment follow.\n",

      "Abstract: An elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in blood has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an elevated NLR has also been implicated in many other conditions that are risk factors for AD, prompting investigation into whether the NLR is directly linked with AD pathology or a result of underlying comorbidities. Herein, we explored the relationship between the NLR and AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Adjusting for sociodemographics, APOE4, and common comorbidities, we investigated these associations in two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the M.J. de Leon CSF repository at NYU. Specifically, we examined associations between the NLR and cross-sectional measures of amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment accompanied by aberrant neuronal apoptosis. Reports suggest that the pro-apoptotic mammalian set20-like kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) instigates neuronal apoptosis via activating the Hippo signaling pathway under various stress conditions, including AD. However, whether inhibiting MST1/2 has any therapeutic benefits in AD remains unknown. Thus, we tested the therapeutic effects of intervening MST1/2 activation via the pharmacological inhibitor Xmu-mp-1 in a sporadic AD rat model. Sporadic AD was established in adult rats by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) injection (3 mg/kg body weight). Xmu-mp-1 (0.5 mg/kg/body weight) was administered once every 48 h for two weeks, and Donepezil (5 mg/kg body weight) was used as a reference standard drug. The therapeutic effects of Xmu-mp-1 on ICV-STZ rats were determined through various behavioral, biochemical, histopathological, and molecular tests. At the behavioral level, Xmu-mp-1 improved cognitive deficits in sporadic AD rats. Further, Xmu-mp-1 treatment reduced STZ-associated tau phosphorylation, amyloid-beta deposition, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal apoptosis, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, Xmu-mp-1 exerted these neuroprotective actions by inactivating the Hippo signaling while potentiating the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in the AD rats. Together, the results of the present study provide compelling support that Xmu-mp-1 negated the neuronal dysregulation in the rat model of sporadic AD. Therefore, inhibiting MST/Hippo signaling and modulating its crosstalk with the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway can be a promising alternative treatment strategy against AD pathology. This is the first study providing novel mechanistic insights into the therapeutic use of Xmu-mp-1 in sporadic AD.\n",

      "Abstract: Late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, with brain changes beginning years before symptoms surface. AD is characterized by neuronal loss, the classic feature of the disease that underlies brain atrophy. However, GWAS reports and recent single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) efforts have highlighted that glial cells, particularly microglia, claim a central role in AD pathophysiology. Here, we tailor pattern-learning algorithms to explore distinct gene programs by integrating the entire transcriptome, yielding distributed AD-predictive modules within the brain's major cell-types. We show that these learned modules are biologically meaningful through the identification of new and relevant enriched signaling cascades. The predictive nature of our modules, especially in microglia, allows us to infer each subject's progression along a disease pseudo-trajectory, confirmed by post-mortem pathological brain tissue markers. Additionally, we quantify the interplay between pairs of cell-type modules in the AD brain, and localized known AD risk genes to enriched module gene programs. Our collective findings advocate for a transition from cell-type-specificity to gene modules specificity to unlock the potential of unique gene programs, recasting the roles of recently reported genome-wide AD risk loci.\n",

They provide over 18 billion hours of unpaid care per year, yet most have no formal dementia education or support. It is extremely difficult for clinicians to keep up with the demand for caregiver education, especially as dementia is neurodegenerative in nature, requiring different information at different stages of the disease process.

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder and no effective drug is available for its treatment. Numerous pathological conditions are believed to be responsible for the initiation and development of AD including c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). The JNKs are one of the enzymes from the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that controls the phosphorylation of various transcription factors on serine and threonine residues, and hold significant responsibilities in tasks like gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Since, JNK3 is primarily expressed in the brain hence its increased levels in the brain are associated with the AD pathology promoting neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, neuroinflammation, and nerve cell apoptosis. The current research work is focused on the development of novel JNK inhibitors as therapeutics for AD employing a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) approach. The ZINC database (14634052 compounds) was investigated after employing pan assay interference (PAINs), drug-likeness, and diversity picking filter to distinguish molecules interacting with JNK3 by following three docking precision criteria: High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS), Standard Precision (SP), and Extra Precision (XP) & MMGBSA. Five lead molecules showed a better docking score in the range of -13.091 to -14.051 kcal/mol better than the reference compound (- 11.828 kcal/mol). The lead compounds displayed acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations of 100 ns and binding free energy calculations. All the lead molecules showed stable RMSD and hydrogen bond interactions throughout the trajectory. The ∆G\n",

      "Abstract: Cortico-basal degeneration is a relatively uncommon cause of degenerative parkinsonism in the elderly. From a clinical point of view, it manifests as a cortico-basal syndrome (CBS), featuring a highly asymmetrical akinetic-rigid syndrome, dystonia, myoclonus and cognitive-behavioral impairment with predominant apraxia. Other clinical phenotypes are possible, including variants with mainly language or behavioral impairment, or with axial, symmetrical parkinsonism resembling progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Current diagnostic criteria take into account the heterogeneity of clinical presentations. However, a diagnosis of certainty can only be reached by a pathological study, with the evidence of TAU-positive intraneuronal inclusions. Indeed SCB may be underpinned by other lesional substrates, ranging from frontotemporal degeneration to Alzheimer's disease. Symptom management must be early, multidisciplinary and adapted to the progression of the disorder. The identification of the pathological substrate is an essential prerequisite for pathophysiological therapeutic trials.\n",

Here, we investigated sex-specific alterations in protein expression of three ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and five solute carriers (SLC) transporters in the prefrontal cortex of a commonly used model of familial AD (FAD), 5xFAD mice. Sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based quantitative targeted absolute proteomic analysis was applied for absolute quantification of transporter protein expression. We compared the changes in transporter protein expressions in 7-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice versus sex-matched wild-type mice.

Accordingly, we designed the Longitudinal Study of Health and Ageing in Kenya (LOSHAK) to generate novel data to address the health and economic consequences of this demographic transition. Specifically, LOSHAK will investigate the social, economic, environmental, biological, and policy processes that shape late-life health and economic well-being in Kenya.

      "Abstract: The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is a key hub of the default mode network underlying autobiographical memory retrieval, which falters early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently performed RNA sequencing of post-mortem PCC tissue samples from 26 elderly Rush Religious Orders Study participants who came to autopsy with an ante-mortem diagnosis of no cognitive impairment but who collectively displayed a range of Braak I-IV neurofibrillary tangle stages. Notably, cognitively unimpaired subjects displaying high Braak stages may represent cognitive resilience to AD pathology. Transcriptomic data revealed elevated synaptic and ATP-related gene expression in Braak Stages III/IV compared with Stages I/II, suggesting these pathways may be related to PCC resilience. We also mined expression profiles for small non-coding micro-RNAs (miRNAs), which regulate mRNA stability and may represent an underexplored potential mechanism of resilience through the fine-tuning of gene expression within complex cellular networks. Twelve miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between Braak Stages I/II and III/IV. However, the extent to which the levels of all identified miRNAs were associated with subject demographics, neuropsychological test performance and/or neuropathological diagnostic criteria within this cohort was not explored. Here, we report that a total of 667 miRNAs are significantly associated (rho > 0.38, \n",

      "Title: How Do Retinoids Affect Alzheimer's Disease and Can They Be Novel Drug Candidates?\n",
      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic, neurological condition that faces many challenges in its management and therapy nowadays highlighting the importance and urgent need of researching new ways of approaching this disease. Retinoic acid and its derivatives, collectively known as the retinoids, are considered promising agents that have disease-modifying properties in affecting Alzheimer's disease. This thesis aims to address the research questions of what the role of retinoids is in Alzheimer's disease, and whether they can be used as a novel drug candidate for treating this condition. Retinoids' properties and agonistic actions on the nuclear receptors retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic X receptor (RXR) affect various pathways as well as their underlying genetic factors that compose important pathophysiological hallmarks causing the progression of Alzheimer's disease as amyloid β (Aβ) production and deposition, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation and phosphorylation, and inflammatory and autoimmune responses. Retinoic acid inhibits the amplification of these pathways and modifies the disease progression in animal models, proposing a solid basis for human trials. Hence, investigating retinoids as pharmacological agents in human trials has been conducted, and several synthetic analogues have been developed to address issues concerning retinoic acid's instability and short half-life, as well as adverse drug reactions. The most prominent of these analogues is tamibarotene, a stable retinoic acid derivative with a higher half-life, higher specificity to target receptors, and fewer adverse reactions. A number of criteria that explain what a novel drug candidate should have when managing Alzheimer's disease have been formulated, and which also explain why most novel drug candidates other than retinoic acid have failed in achieving clinical results. Most of these candidates share one common trait which is a single-target approach in targeting disease pathways. This means that when administering these agents, their actions are to target a single disease-causing pathway at a time but do not affect other pathways. On the other hand, tamibarotene is a novel drug candidate that targets a range of pathways at once and provides a more comprehensive approach in its pharmacological actions.\n",

It is a colourless water insoluble liquid and obtained by the hot and cold extraction processes. The nutritional components of VCO are mainly contributed to by lauric acid, its primary content. VCO has shown its anticancer, antimicrobial, analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammatory properties. Because of these medicinal properties, VCO has gained the wider attention among the medical field. Most evidently VCO has shown its potential antioxidant property, because of its phenolic compounds and medium chain fatty acids. It is one of the beneficial compounds used to prevent and treat the oxidative stress induced neurological disorders like stress, depression and Alzheimer's disease. Dietary supplementation of VCO is easy and economical and safer in daily life among all age groups. It is also beneficial for the cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatological, reproductive and bone health. It can also be applied to the skin as a moisturizer in the paediatric age group. Hence, exploration of antioxidant property as well as other beneficial effects of VCO in various health conditions will be valuable.\n",

Characterizing white matter tissue microstructure using Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) may help elucidate the biological underpinnings of white matter injury in individuals with DLB. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and NODDI metrics were compared in 45 patients within the dementia with Lewy bodies spectrum (mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (n = 13) and probable dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 32)) against 45 matched controls using conditional logistic models. We evaluated the associations of tau and amyloid-β with DTI and NODDI parameters and examined the correlations of AD-related white matter injury with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Structural equation models (SEM) explored relationships among age, APOE ε4, amyloid-β, tau, and white matter injury. The DLB spectrum group exhibited widespread white matter abnormalities, including reduced fractional anisotropy, increased mean diffusivity, and decreased neurite density index. Tau was significantly associated with limbic and temporal white matter injury, which was, in turn, associated with worse CDR. SEM revealed that amyloid-β exerted indirect effects on white matter injury through tau. We observed widespread disruptions in white matter tracts in DLB that were not attributed to AD pathologies, likely due to α-synuclein-related injury. However, a fraction of the white matter injury could be attributed to AD pathology. Our findings underscore the impact of AD pathology on white matter integrity in DLB and highlight the utility of NODDI in elucidating the biological basis of white matter injury in DLB.\n",

      "Abstract: The biological substrate of persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia is still unclear. However, as many neurodegenerative diseases present with smell impairment at onset, it may theoretically reflect degeneration within the central olfactory circuits. However, no data still exist regarding the post-COVID-19 patients. As the olfactory neurons (ONs) mirror pathological changes in the brain, allowing for tracking the underlying molecular events, here, we performed a broad analysis of ONs from patients with persistent post-COVID-19 OD to identify traces of potential neurodegeneration. ONs were collected through the non-invasive brushing of the olfactory mucosa from ten patients with persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia (lasting > 6 months after infection) and ten age/sex-matched controls. Immunofluorescence staining for protein quantification and RT-PCR for gene expression levels were combined to measure ONs markers of α-synuclein, amyloid-β, and tau pathology, axonal injury, and mitochondrial network. Patients and controls had similar ONs levels of oligomeric α-synuclein, amyloid-β peptide, tau protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), cytochrome C oxidase subunit 3 (COX3), and the heat shock protein 60 (HSP60). Our findings thus did not provide evidence for synucleinopathy and amyloid-β mismetabolism or gross traces of neuronal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction within the olfactory system in the early phase of persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia.\n",

      "Title: Role of autophagy and proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases: Exploring the therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "Abstract: Neurodegenerative disorders are devastating disorders characterized by gradual loss of neurons and cognition or mobility impairment. The common pathological features of these diseases are associated with the accumulation of misfolded or aggregation of proteins. The pivotal roles of autophagy and proteostasis in maintaining cellular health and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). This article presents an in-depth examination of the interplay between autophagy and proteostasis, highlighting how these processes cooperatively contribute to cellular homeostasis and prevent pathogenic protein aggregate accumulation. Furthermore, the review emphasises the potential therapeutic implications of targeting autophagy and proteostasis to mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. While advancements in research hold promise for developing novel treatments, the article also addresses the challenges and complexities associated with modulating these intricate cellular pathways. Ultimately, advancing understanding of the underlying mechanism of autophagy and proteostasis in neurodegenerative disorders provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic avenues and future research directions.\n",

      "Title: Aurothioglucose encapsulated nanoparticles fostered neuroprotection in streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "Abstract: Alzherimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent ubiquitous ailment worldwide with limited therapies that only alleviate the symptoms of AD but do not cure them entirely because of the restricted blood-brain barrier passage of the drug. Hence with new advanced technology, nanoparticles can offer an opportunity as the active candidate to overcome the above limitations. Aurothioglucose, a synthetic glucose derivative of the gold compound, has been clinically proven to be an effective anti-inflammatory drug for rheumatic arthritis. Recently, several scientific groups have developed gold nanoparticle preparations and tested them for the treatment of dementia. This study was planned to prepare the PLGA nanoparticles of aurothioglucose (ATG) and check the neuroprotective potential against STZ-induced AD in rats. The nanoparticles were prepared using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method and characterized for various parameters such as drug-excipient interaction, particle size, zeta potential, and morphology. Then, rats were injected STZ (3 mg/kg/i.c.v., days 1 and 3) and ATG (5 and 10 mg/kg/s.c.), ATG NPs (2.5 and 5 mg/kg/s.c.) and donepezil (2 mg/kg/p.o) from 15th to 29th day. Behavior parameters were performed using an actophotometer, MWM, and ORT. On the 30th day, all the animals were sacrificed, and the brains were isolated for estimating biochemical, neurochemical, and proinflammatory markers. It was observed that ATG NPs significantly restored all behavior and neurotransmitter alterations caused by STZ. Also, it increased antioxidant levels and decreased inflammatory cytokines significantly, then ATG alone. Thus, the study suggests that ATG loaded PLGA NPs could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy to slow the process of AD.\n",

      "Abstract: Here, we provide an in-depth consideration of our current understanding of engrams, spanning from molecular to network levels, and hippocampal neurogenesis, in health and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review highlights novel findings in these emerging research fields and future research directions for novel therapeutic avenues for memory failure in dementia. Engrams, memory in AD, and hippocampal neurogenesis have each been extensively studied. The integration of these topics, however, has been relatively less deliberated, and is the focus of this review. We primarily focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, which is a key area of episodic memory formation. Episodic memory is significantly impaired in AD, and is also the site of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Advancements in technology, especially opto- and chemogenetics, have made sophisticated manipulations of engram cells possible. Furthermore, innovative methods have emerged for monitoring neurons, even specific neuronal populations, in vivo while animals engage in tasks, such as calcium imaging. In vivo calcium imaging contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of engram cells. Critically, studies of the engram in the DG using these technologies have shown the important contribution of hippocampal neurogenesis for memory in both health and AD. Together, the discussion of these topics provides a holistic perspective that motivates questions for future research.\n",

      "Abstract: The beta-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is well known for its role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Recent publications, including our own, have demonstrated a role for this enzyme in other chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of BACE1 in the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc). BACE1 protein levels were elevated in SSc patient skin. Inhibition of BACE1 with small molecule inhibitors or siRNA blocked SSc and fibrotic stimuli mediated fibroblast activation. Furthermore, we show that BACE1 regulation of dermal fibroblast activation is dependent on β-catenin and Notch signalling. The Neurotropic factor BDNF negatively regulates BACE1 expression and activity in dermal fibroblasts. Finally, sera from SSc patients show higher Aβ and lower BDNF levels compared to healthy controls. The ability of BACE1 to regulate SSc fibroblast activation reveals a therapeutic target in SSc. Several BACE1 inhibitors have been shown to be safe in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and could be repurposed to ameliorate fibrosis progression.\n",

In a previous work, a 3D pharmacophore model for GSK-3β inhibitors was created and the results suggested that derivative ZINC67773573, VIII, may provide a promising lead for developing novel GSK-3β inhibitors for the AD's treatment. Consequently, in this work, novel series of quinolin-2-one derivatives were synthesized and assessed for their GSK-3β inhibitory properties.

      "Abstract: Prion-like spread of disease-specific tau conformers is a hallmark of all tauopathies. A 19-residue probe peptide containing a P301L mutation and spanning the R2/R3 splice junction of tau folds and stacks into seeding-competent fibrils and induces aggregation of 4R, but not 3R tau. These tau peptide fibrils propagate aggregated intracellular tau over multiple generations, have a high β-sheet content, a colocalized lipid signal, and adopt a well-defined U-shaped fold found in 4R tauopathy brain-derived fibrils. Fully atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to compute the free energy landscapes of the conformational ensemble of the peptide monomers. These identified an aggregation-prohibiting β-hairpin structure and an aggregation-competent U-fold unique to 4R tauopathy fibrils. Guided by MD simulations, we identified that the N-terminal-flanking residues to PHF6, which slightly vary between 4R and 3R isoforms, modulate seeding. Strikingly, when a single amino acid switch at position 305 replaced the serine of 4R tau with a lysine from the corresponding position in the first repeat of 3R tau, the seeding induced by the 19-residue peptide was markedly reduced. Conversely, a 4R tau mimic with three repeats, prepared by replacing those amino acids in the first repeat with those amino acids uniquely present in the second repeat, recovered aggregation when exposed to the 19-residue peptide. These peptide fibrils function as partial prions to recruit naive 4R tau-ten times the length of the peptide-and serve as a critical template for 4R tauopathy propagation. These results hint at opportunities for tau isoform-specific therapeutic interventions.\n",

      "Abstract: Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo-enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi-rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co-immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66%. This study offers an efficient chemo-enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) accounts for the majority of dementia, and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the early stage of AD. Early and accurate diagnosis of dementia plays a vital role in more targeted treatments and effectively halting disease progression. However, the clinical diagnosis of dementia requires various examinations, which are expensive and require a high level of expertise from the doctor. In this paper, we proposed a classification method based on multi-modal data including Electroencephalogram (EEG), eye tracking and behavioral data for early diagnosis of AD and MCI. Paradigms with various task difficulties were used to identify different severity of dementia: eye movement task and resting-state EEG tasks were used to detect AD, while eye movement task and delayed match-to-sample task were used to detect MCI. Besides, the effects of different features were compared and suitable EEG channels were selected for the detection. Furthermore, we proposed a data augmentation method to enlarge the dataset, designed an extra ERPNet feature extract layer to extract multi-modal features and used domain-adversarial neural network to improve the performance of MCI diagnosis. We achieved an average accuracy of 88.81% for MCI diagnosis and 100% for AD diagnosis. The results of this paper suggest that our classification method can provide a feasible and affordable way to diagnose dementia.\n",

      "Abstract: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is extremely intricate, which makes AD patients almost incurable. Recent studies have demonstrated that analyzing multi-modal data can offer a comprehensive perspective on the different stages of AD progression, which is beneficial for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, we propose a deep self-reconstruction fusion similarity hashing (DS-FSH) method to effectively capture the AD-related biomarkers from the multi-modal data and leverage them to diagnose AD. Given that most existing methods ignore the topological structure of the data, a deep self-reconstruction model based on random walk graph regularization is designed to reconstruct the multi-modal data, thereby learning the nonlinear relationship between samples. Additionally, a fused similarity hash based on anchor graph is proposed to generate discriminative binary hash codes for multi-modal reconstructed data. This allows sample fused similarity to be effectively modeled by a fusion similarity matrix based on anchor graph while modal correlation can be approximated by Hamming distance. Especially, extracted features from the multi-modal data are classified using deep sparse autoencoders classifier. Finally, experiments conduct on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database show that DS-FSH outperforms comparable methods of AD classification. To conclude, DS-FSH identifies multi-modal features closely associated with AD, which are expected to contribute significantly to understanding of the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "Abstract: In biomedical literature, biological pathways are commonly described through a combination of images and text. These pathways contain valuable information, including genes and their relationships, which provide insight into biological mechanisms and precision medicine. Curating pathway information across the literature enables the integration of this information to build a comprehensive knowledge base. While some studies have extracted pathway information from images and text independently, they often overlook the correspondence between the two modalities. In this paper, we present a pathway figure curation system named pathCLIP for identifying genes and gene relations from pathway figures. Our key innovation is the use of an image-text contrastive learning model to learn coordinated embeddings of image snippets and text descriptions of genes and gene relations, thereby improving curation. Our validation results, using pathway figures from PubMed, showed that our multimodal model outperforms models using only a single modality. Additionally, our system effectively curates genes and gene relations from multiple literature sources. Two case studies on extracting pathway information from literature of non-small cell lung cancer and Alzheimer's disease further demonstrate the usefulness of our curated pathway information in enhancing related pathways in the KEGG database.\n",

      "Abstract: Reactive astrogliosis accompanies the two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles-and parallels neurodegeneration in AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Thus, there is growing interest in developing imaging and fluid biomarkers of reactive astrogliosis for AD/ADRD diagnosis and prognostication. Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is emerging as a target for PET imaging radiotracers of reactive astrogliosis. However, a thorough characterization of MAO-B expression in postmortem control and AD/ADRD brains is lacking. We sought to: (1) identify the primary cell type(s) expressing MAO-B in control and AD brains; (2) quantify MAO-B immunoreactivity in multiple brain regions of control and AD donors as a proxy for PET radiotracer uptake; (3) correlate MAO-B level with local AD neuropathological changes, reactive glia, and cortical atrophy; (4) determine whether the MAOB rs1799836 SNP genotype impacts MAO-B expression level; (5) compare MAO-B immunoreactivity across AD/ADRD, including Lewy body diseases (LBD) and frontotemporal lobar degenerations with tau (FTLD-Tau) and TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). We found that MAO-B is mainly expressed by subpial and perivascular cortical astrocytes as well as by fibrous white matter astrocytes in control brains, whereas in AD brains, MAO-B is significantly upregulated by both cortical reactive astrocytes and white matter astrocytes across temporal, frontal, and occipital lobes. By contrast, MAO-B expression level was unchanged and lowest in cerebellum. Cortical MAO-B expression was independently associated with cortical atrophy and local measures of reactive astrocytes and microglia, and significantly increased in reactive astrocytes surrounding Thioflavin-S+ dense-core Aβ plaques. MAO-B expression was not affected by the MAOB rs1799836 SNP genotype. MAO-B expression was also significantly increased in the frontal cortex and white matter of donors with corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, and FTLD-TDP, but not in LBD or progressive supranuclear palsy. These findings support ongoing efforts to develop MAO-B-based PET radiotracers to image reactive astrogliosis in AD/ADRD.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurological disorder characterized by insidious onset. Identifying potential markers in its emergence and progression is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Imaging genetics typically merges genetic variables with multiple imaging parameters, employing various association analysis algorithms to investigate the links between pathological phenotypes and genetic variations, and to unearth molecular-level insights from brain images. However, most existing imaging genetics algorithms based on sparse learning assume a linear relationship between genetic factors and brain functions, limiting their ability to discern complex nonlinear correlation patterns and resulting in reduced accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel nonlinear imaging genetic association analysis method, Deep Self-Reconstruction-based Adaptive Sparse Multi-view Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (DSR-AdaSMDGCCA). This approach facilitates joint learning of the nonlinear relationships between pathological phenotypes and genetic variations by integrating three different types of data: structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and gene expression data. By incorporating nonlinear transformations in DGCCA, our model effectively uncovers nonlinear associations across multiple data types. Additionally, the DSR algorithm clusters samples with identical labels, incorporating label information into the nonlinear feature extraction process and thus enhancing the performance of association analysis. The application of the DSR-AdaSMDGCCA algorithm on real data sets identified several AD risk regions (such as the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and fusiform gyrus) and risk genes (including VSIG4, NEDD4L, and PINK1), achieving maximum classification accuracy with the fewest selected features compared to baseline algorithms. Molecular biology enrichment analysis revealed that the pathways enriched by these top genes are intimately linked to AD progression, affirming that our algorithm not only improves correlation analysis performance but also identifies biologically significant markers.\n",

      "Abstract: Neurodegeneration, which manifests as several chronic and incurable diseases, is an age-related condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and poses a significant threat to the public's health for the elderly. Recent decades have experienced an alarming increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), a severe public health issue due to the ongoing development of people living in modern civilizations. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading trigger of age-related dementia. Currently, there are no efficient therapeutics to delay, stop, or reverse the disease's course development. Several studies found that dietary bioactive phytochemicals, primarily flavonoids, influence the pathophysiological processes underlying AD. Flavonoids work well as a supplement to manufactured therapies for NDDs. Flavonoids are effective in complementing synthetic approaches to treat NDDs. They are biologically active phytochemicals with promising pharmacological activities, for instance, antiviral, anti-allergic, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant effects. The production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and oxidative stress (OS) are downregulated by flavonoids, which slow the course of AD. Hence, this research turned from preclinical evidence to feasible clinical applications to develop newer therapeutics, focusing on the therapeutic potential of flavonoids against AD.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and cognitive impairment, often accompanied by alterations in mood, confusion, and, ultimately, a state of acute mental disturbance. The cerebral cortex is considered a promising area for investigating the underlying causes of AD by analyzing transcriptional patterns, which could be complemented by investigating blood samples obtained from patients. We analyzed the RNA expression profiles of three distinct areas of the brain cortex, including the frontal cortex (FC), temporal cortex (TC), and entorhinal cortex (EC) in patients with AD. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across the three regions. The two genes with the most significant expression changes in the EC region were selected for assessing mRNA expression levels in the peripheral blood of late-onset AD patients using quantitative PCR (qPCR). We identified eight shared DEGs in these regions, including AEBP1 and COLEC12, which exhibited prominent changes in expression. Functional enrichment analysis uncovered a significant association of these DEGs with the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway and processes related to angiogenesis. Importantly, we established a robust connection between the up-regulation of AEBP1 and COLEC12 in both the brain and peripheral blood. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the potential of AEBP1 and COLEC12 genes as effective diagnostic tools for distinguishing between late-onset AD patients and healthy controls. This study unveils the intricate interplay between AEBP1 and COLEC12 in AD and underscores their potential as markers for disease detection and monitoring.\n",

      "Abstract: About 11 million Americans are caregivers for the 6.7 million Americans currently living with dementia. They provide over 18 billion hours of unpaid care per year, yet most have no formal dementia education or support. It is extremely difficult for clinicians to keep up with the demand for caregiver education, especially as dementia is neurodegenerative in nature, requiring different information at different stages of the disease process. In this digital age, caregivers often seek dementia information on the internet, but clinicians lack a single, reliable compendium of expert-approved digital resources to provide to dementia caregivers.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder and no effective drug is available for its treatment. Numerous pathological conditions are believed to be responsible for the initiation and development of AD including c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). The JNKs are one of the enzymes from the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that controls the phosphorylation of various transcription factors on serine and threonine residues, and hold significant responsibilities in tasks like gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Since, JNK3 is primarily expressed in the brain hence its increased levels in the brain are associated with the AD pathology promoting neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, neuroinflammation, and nerve cell apoptosis. The current research work is focused on the development of novel JNK inhibitors as therapeutics for AD employing a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) approach. The ZINC database (14634052 compounds) was investigated after employing pan assay interference (PAINs), drug-likeness, and diversity picking filter to distinguish molecules interacting with JNK3 by following three docking precision criteria: High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS), Standard Precision (SP), and Extra Precision (XP) & MMGBSA. Five lead molecules showed a better docking score in the range of -13.091 to -14.051 kcal/mol better than the reference compound (- 11.828 kcal/mol). The lead compounds displayed acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations of 100 ns and binding free energy calculations. All the lead molecules showed stable RMSD and hydrogen bond interactions throughout the trajectory. The ∆G\n",

      "Abstract: Cortico-basal degeneration is a relatively uncommon cause of degenerative parkinsonism in the elderly. From a clinical point of view, it manifests as a cortico-basal syndrome (CBS), featuring a highly asymmetrical akinetic-rigid syndrome, dystonia, myoclonus and cognitive-behavioral impairment with predominant apraxia. Other clinical phenotypes are possible, including variants with mainly language or behavioral impairment, or with axial, symmetrical parkinsonism resembling progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Current diagnostic criteria take into account the heterogeneity of clinical presentations. However, a diagnosis of certainty can only be reached by a pathological study, with the evidence of TAU-positive intraneuronal inclusions. Indeed SCB may be underpinned by other lesional substrates, ranging from frontotemporal degeneration to Alzheimer's disease. Symptom management must be early, multidisciplinary and adapted to the progression of the disorder. The identification of the pathological substrate is an essential prerequisite for pathophysiological therapeutic trials.\n",

      "Abstract: The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is a key hub of the default mode network underlying autobiographical memory retrieval, which falters early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently performed RNA sequencing of post-mortem PCC tissue samples from 26 elderly Rush Religious Orders Study participants who came to autopsy with an ante-mortem diagnosis of no cognitive impairment but who collectively displayed a range of Braak I-IV neurofibrillary tangle stages. Notably, cognitively unimpaired subjects displaying high Braak stages may represent cognitive resilience to AD pathology. Transcriptomic data revealed elevated synaptic and ATP-related gene expression in Braak Stages III/IV compared with Stages I/II, suggesting these pathways may be related to PCC resilience. We also mined expression profiles for small non-coding micro-RNAs (miRNAs), which regulate mRNA stability and may represent an underexplored potential mechanism of resilience through the fine-tuning of gene expression within complex cellular networks. Twelve miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between Braak Stages I/II and III/IV. However, the extent to which the levels of all identified miRNAs were associated with subject demographics, neuropsychological test performance and/or neuropathological diagnostic criteria within this cohort was not explored. Here, we report that a total of 667 miRNAs are significantly associated (rho > 0.38, \n",

      "Title: How Do Retinoids Affect Alzheimer's Disease and Can They Be Novel Drug Candidates?\n",
      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic, neurological condition that faces many challenges in its management and therapy nowadays highlighting the importance and urgent need of researching new ways of approaching this disease. Retinoic acid and its derivatives, collectively known as the retinoids, are considered promising agents that have disease-modifying properties in affecting Alzheimer's disease. This thesis aims to address the research questions of what the role of retinoids is in Alzheimer's disease, and whether they can be used as a novel drug candidate for treating this condition. Retinoids' properties and agonistic actions on the nuclear receptors retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic X receptor (RXR) affect various pathways as well as their underlying genetic factors that compose important pathophysiological hallmarks causing the progression of Alzheimer's disease as amyloid β (Aβ) production and deposition, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation and phosphorylation, and inflammatory and autoimmune responses. Retinoic acid inhibits the amplification of these pathways and modifies the disease progression in animal models, proposing a solid basis for human trials. Hence, investigating retinoids as pharmacological agents in human trials has been conducted, and several synthetic analogues have been developed to address issues concerning retinoic acid's instability and short half-life, as well as adverse drug reactions. The most prominent of these analogues is tamibarotene, a stable retinoic acid derivative with a higher half-life, higher specificity to target receptors, and fewer adverse reactions. A number of criteria that explain what a novel drug candidate should have when managing Alzheimer's disease have been formulated, and which also explain why most novel drug candidates other than retinoic acid have failed in achieving clinical results. Most of these candidates share one common trait which is a single-target approach in targeting disease pathways. This means that when administering these agents, their actions are to target a single disease-causing pathway at a time but do not affect other pathways. On the other hand, tamibarotene is a novel drug candidate that targets a range of pathways at once and provides a more comprehensive approach in its pharmacological actions.\n",

It is a colourless water insoluble liquid and obtained by the hot and cold extraction processes. The nutritional components of VCO are mainly contributed to by lauric acid, its primary content. VCO has shown its anticancer, antimicrobial, analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammatory properties. Because of these medicinal properties, VCO has gained the wider attention among the medical field. Most evidently VCO has shown its potential antioxidant property, because of its phenolic compounds and medium chain fatty acids. It is one of the beneficial compounds used to prevent and treat the oxidative stress induced neurological disorders like stress, depression and Alzheimer's disease. Dietary supplementation of VCO is easy and economical and safer in daily life among all age groups. It is also beneficial for the cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatological, reproductive and bone health. It can also be applied to the skin as a moisturizer in the paediatric age group. Hence, exploration of antioxidant property as well as other beneficial effects of VCO in various health conditions will be valuable.\n",

      "Abstract: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative condition often co-occurring with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Characterizing white matter tissue microstructure using Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) may help elucidate the biological underpinnings of white matter injury in individuals with DLB. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and NODDI metrics were compared in 45 patients within the dementia with Lewy bodies spectrum (mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (n = 13) and probable dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 32)) against 45 matched controls using conditional logistic models. We evaluated the associations of tau and amyloid-β with DTI and NODDI parameters and examined the correlations of AD-related white matter injury with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Structural equation models (SEM) explored relationships among age, APOE ε4, amyloid-β, tau, and white matter injury. The DLB spectrum group exhibited widespread white matter abnormalities, including reduced fractional anisotropy, increased mean diffusivity, and decreased neurite density index. Tau was significantly associated with limbic and temporal white matter injury, which was, in turn, associated with worse CDR. SEM revealed that amyloid-β exerted indirect effects on white matter injury through tau. We observed widespread disruptions in white matter tracts in DLB that were not attributed to AD pathologies, likely due to α-synuclein-related injury. However, a fraction of the white matter injury could be attributed to AD pathology. Our findings underscore the impact of AD pathology on white matter integrity in DLB and highlight the utility of NODDI in elucidating the biological basis of white matter injury in DLB.\n",

      "Abstract: The biological substrate of persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia is still unclear. However, as many neurodegenerative diseases present with smell impairment at onset, it may theoretically reflect degeneration within the central olfactory circuits. However, no data still exist regarding the post-COVID-19 patients. As the olfactory neurons (ONs) mirror pathological changes in the brain, allowing for tracking the underlying molecular events, here, we performed a broad analysis of ONs from patients with persistent post-COVID-19 OD to identify traces of potential neurodegeneration. ONs were collected through the non-invasive brushing of the olfactory mucosa from ten patients with persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia (lasting > 6 months after infection) and ten age/sex-matched controls. Immunofluorescence staining for protein quantification and RT-PCR for gene expression levels were combined to measure ONs markers of α-synuclein, amyloid-β, and tau pathology, axonal injury, and mitochondrial network. Patients and controls had similar ONs levels of oligomeric α-synuclein, amyloid-β peptide, tau protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), cytochrome C oxidase subunit 3 (COX3), and the heat shock protein 60 (HSP60). Our findings thus did not provide evidence for synucleinopathy and amyloid-β mismetabolism or gross traces of neuronal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction within the olfactory system in the early phase of persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia.\n",

      "Abstract: Neurodegenerative disorders are devastating disorders characterized by gradual loss of neurons and cognition or mobility impairment. The common pathological features of these diseases are associated with the accumulation of misfolded or aggregation of proteins. The pivotal roles of autophagy and proteostasis in maintaining cellular health and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). This article presents an in-depth examination of the interplay between autophagy and proteostasis, highlighting how these processes cooperatively contribute to cellular homeostasis and prevent pathogenic protein aggregate accumulation. Furthermore, the review emphasises the potential therapeutic implications of targeting autophagy and proteostasis to mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. While advancements in research hold promise for developing novel treatments, the article also addresses the challenges and complexities associated with modulating these intricate cellular pathways. Ultimately, advancing understanding of the underlying mechanism of autophagy and proteostasis in neurodegenerative disorders provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic avenues and future research directions.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzherimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent ubiquitous ailment worldwide with limited therapies that only alleviate the symptoms of AD but do not cure them entirely because of the restricted blood-brain barrier passage of the drug. Hence with new advanced technology, nanoparticles can offer an opportunity as the active candidate to overcome the above limitations. Aurothioglucose, a synthetic glucose derivative of the gold compound, has been clinically proven to be an effective anti-inflammatory drug for rheumatic arthritis. Recently, several scientific groups have developed gold nanoparticle preparations and tested them for the treatment of dementia. This study was planned to prepare the PLGA nanoparticles of aurothioglucose (ATG) and check the neuroprotective potential against STZ-induced AD in rats. The nanoparticles were prepared using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method and characterized for various parameters such as drug-excipient interaction, particle size, zeta potential, and morphology. Then, rats were injected STZ (3 mg/kg/i.c.v., days 1 and 3) and ATG (5 and 10 mg/kg/s.c.), ATG NPs (2.5 and 5 mg/kg/s.c.) and donepezil (2 mg/kg/p.o) from 15th to 29th day. Behavior parameters were performed using an actophotometer, MWM, and ORT. On the 30th day, all the animals were sacrificed, and the brains were isolated for estimating biochemical, neurochemical, and proinflammatory markers. It was observed that ATG NPs significantly restored all behavior and neurotransmitter alterations caused by STZ. Also, it increased antioxidant levels and decreased inflammatory cytokines significantly, then ATG alone. Thus, the study suggests that ATG loaded PLGA NPs could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy to slow the process of AD.\n",

      "Abstract: Here, we provide an in-depth consideration of our current understanding of engrams, spanning from molecular to network levels, and hippocampal neurogenesis, in health and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review highlights novel findings in these emerging research fields and future research directions for novel therapeutic avenues for memory failure in dementia. Engrams, memory in AD, and hippocampal neurogenesis have each been extensively studied. The integration of these topics, however, has been relatively less deliberated, and is the focus of this review. We primarily focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, which is a key area of episodic memory formation. Episodic memory is significantly impaired in AD, and is also the site of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Advancements in technology, especially opto- and chemogenetics, have made sophisticated manipulations of engram cells possible. Furthermore, innovative methods have emerged for monitoring neurons, even specific neuronal populations, in vivo while animals engage in tasks, such as calcium imaging. In vivo calcium imaging contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of engram cells. Critically, studies of the engram in the DG using these technologies have shown the important contribution of hippocampal neurogenesis for memory in both health and AD. Together, the discussion of these topics provides a holistic perspective that motivates questions for future research.\n",

      "Abstract: The beta-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is well known for its role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Recent publications, including our own, have demonstrated a role for this enzyme in other chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of BACE1 in the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc). BACE1 protein levels were elevated in SSc patient skin. Inhibition of BACE1 with small molecule inhibitors or siRNA blocked SSc and fibrotic stimuli mediated fibroblast activation. Furthermore, we show that BACE1 regulation of dermal fibroblast activation is dependent on β-catenin and Notch signalling. The Neurotropic factor BDNF negatively regulates BACE1 expression and activity in dermal fibroblasts. Finally, sera from SSc patients show higher Aβ and lower BDNF levels compared to healthy controls. The ability of BACE1 to regulate SSc fibroblast activation reveals a therapeutic target in SSc. Several BACE1 inhibitors have been shown to be safe in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and could be repurposed to ameliorate fibrosis progression.\n",

      "Abstract: Recently, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) has been considered as a critical factor implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a previous work, a 3D pharmacophore model for GSK-3β inhibitors was created and the results suggested that derivative ZINC67773573, VIII, may provide a promising lead for developing novel GSK-3β inhibitors for the AD's treatment. Consequently, in this work, novel series of quinolin-2-one derivatives were synthesized and assessed for their GSK-3β inhibitory properties. In vitro screening identified three compounds: 7c, 7e and 7f as promising GSK-3β inhibitors. Compounds 7c, 7e and 7f were found to exhibit superior inhibitory effect on GSK-3β with IC\n",

We investigated whether age at menopause, vascular risk, and history of hormone therapy (HT) containing estrogens together influence cognition over a 3-year follow-up period. We hypothesized that earlier menopause and elevated vascular risk would have a synergistic association with lower cognitive scores at follow-up and that HT containing estrogens would attenuate this synergistic association to preserve cognition.\n",

      "Abstract: Prion-like spread of disease-specific tau conformers is a hallmark of all tauopathies. A 19-residue probe peptide containing a P301L mutation and spanning the R2/R3 splice junction of tau folds and stacks into seeding-competent fibrils and induces aggregation of 4R, but not 3R tau. These tau peptide fibrils propagate aggregated intracellular tau over multiple generations, have a high β-sheet content, a colocalized lipid signal, and adopt a well-defined U-shaped fold found in 4R tauopathy brain-derived fibrils. Fully atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to compute the free energy landscapes of the conformational ensemble of the peptide monomers. These identified an aggregation-prohibiting β-hairpin structure and an aggregation-competent U-fold unique to 4R tauopathy fibrils. Guided by MD simulations, we identified that the N-terminal-flanking residues to PHF6, which slightly vary between 4R and 3R isoforms, modulate seeding. Strikingly, when a single amino acid switch at position 305 replaced the serine of 4R tau with a lysine from the corresponding position in the first repeat of 3R tau, the seeding induced by the 19-residue peptide was markedly reduced. Conversely, a 4R tau mimic with three repeats, prepared by replacing those amino acids in the first repeat with those amino acids uniquely present in the second repeat, recovered aggregation when exposed to the 19-residue peptide. These peptide fibrils function as partial prions to recruit naive 4R tau-ten times the length of the peptide-and serve as a critical template for 4R tauopathy propagation. These results hint at opportunities for tau isoform-specific therapeutic interventions.\n",

      "Abstract: Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo-enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi-rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co-immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66%. This study offers an efficient chemo-enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) accounts for the majority of dementia, and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the early stage of AD. Early and accurate diagnosis of dementia plays a vital role in more targeted treatments and effectively halting disease progression. However, the clinical diagnosis of dementia requires various examinations, which are expensive and require a high level of expertise from the doctor. In this paper, we proposed a classification method based on multi-modal data including Electroencephalogram (EEG), eye tracking and behavioral data for early diagnosis of AD and MCI. Paradigms with various task difficulties were used to identify different severity of dementia: eye movement task and resting-state EEG tasks were used to detect AD, while eye movement task and delayed match-to-sample task were used to detect MCI. Besides, the effects of different features were compared and suitable EEG channels were selected for the detection. Furthermore, we proposed a data augmentation method to enlarge the dataset, designed an extra ERPNet feature extract layer to extract multi-modal features and used domain-adversarial neural network to improve the performance of MCI diagnosis. We achieved an average accuracy of 88.81% for MCI diagnosis and 100% for AD diagnosis. The results of this paper suggest that our classification method can provide a feasible and affordable way to diagnose dementia.\n",

      "Abstract: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is extremely intricate, which makes AD patients almost incurable. Recent studies have demonstrated that analyzing multi-modal data can offer a comprehensive perspective on the different stages of AD progression, which is beneficial for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, we propose a deep self-reconstruction fusion similarity hashing (DS-FSH) method to effectively capture the AD-related biomarkers from the multi-modal data and leverage them to diagnose AD. Given that most existing methods ignore the topological structure of the data, a deep self-reconstruction model based on random walk graph regularization is designed to reconstruct the multi-modal data, thereby learning the nonlinear relationship between samples. Additionally, a fused similarity hash based on anchor graph is proposed to generate discriminative binary hash codes for multi-modal reconstructed data. This allows sample fused similarity to be effectively modeled by a fusion similarity matrix based on anchor graph while modal correlation can be approximated by Hamming distance. Especially, extracted features from the multi-modal data are classified using deep sparse autoencoders classifier. Finally, experiments conduct on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database show that DS-FSH outperforms comparable methods of AD classification. To conclude, DS-FSH identifies multi-modal features closely associated with AD, which are expected to contribute significantly to understanding of the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "Abstract: In biomedical literature, biological pathways are commonly described through a combination of images and text. These pathways contain valuable information, including genes and their relationships, which provide insight into biological mechanisms and precision medicine. Curating pathway information across the literature enables the integration of this information to build a comprehensive knowledge base. While some studies have extracted pathway information from images and text independently, they often overlook the correspondence between the two modalities. In this paper, we present a pathway figure curation system named pathCLIP for identifying genes and gene relations from pathway figures. Our key innovation is the use of an image-text contrastive learning model to learn coordinated embeddings of image snippets and text descriptions of genes and gene relations, thereby improving curation. Our validation results, using pathway figures from PubMed, showed that our multimodal model outperforms models using only a single modality. Additionally, our system effectively curates genes and gene relations from multiple literature sources. Two case studies on extracting pathway information from literature of non-small cell lung cancer and Alzheimer's disease further demonstrate the usefulness of our curated pathway information in enhancing related pathways in the KEGG database.\n",

      "Abstract: Reactive astrogliosis accompanies the two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles-and parallels neurodegeneration in AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Thus, there is growing interest in developing imaging and fluid biomarkers of reactive astrogliosis for AD/ADRD diagnosis and prognostication. Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is emerging as a target for PET imaging radiotracers of reactive astrogliosis. However, a thorough characterization of MAO-B expression in postmortem control and AD/ADRD brains is lacking. We sought to: (1) identify the primary cell type(s) expressing MAO-B in control and AD brains; (2) quantify MAO-B immunoreactivity in multiple brain regions of control and AD donors as a proxy for PET radiotracer uptake; (3) correlate MAO-B level with local AD neuropathological changes, reactive glia, and cortical atrophy; (4) determine whether the MAOB rs1799836 SNP genotype impacts MAO-B expression level; (5) compare MAO-B immunoreactivity across AD/ADRD, including Lewy body diseases (LBD) and frontotemporal lobar degenerations with tau (FTLD-Tau) and TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). We found that MAO-B is mainly expressed by subpial and perivascular cortical astrocytes as well as by fibrous white matter astrocytes in control brains, whereas in AD brains, MAO-B is significantly upregulated by both cortical reactive astrocytes and white matter astrocytes across temporal, frontal, and occipital lobes. By contrast, MAO-B expression level was unchanged and lowest in cerebellum. Cortical MAO-B expression was independently associated with cortical atrophy and local measures of reactive astrocytes and microglia, and significantly increased in reactive astrocytes surrounding Thioflavin-S+ dense-core Aβ plaques. MAO-B expression was not affected by the MAOB rs1799836 SNP genotype. MAO-B expression was also significantly increased in the frontal cortex and white matter of donors with corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, and FTLD-TDP, but not in LBD or progressive supranuclear palsy. These findings support ongoing efforts to develop MAO-B-based PET radiotracers to image reactive astrogliosis in AD/ADRD.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurological disorder characterized by insidious onset. Identifying potential markers in its emergence and progression is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Imaging genetics typically merges genetic variables with multiple imaging parameters, employing various association analysis algorithms to investigate the links between pathological phenotypes and genetic variations, and to unearth molecular-level insights from brain images. However, most existing imaging genetics algorithms based on sparse learning assume a linear relationship between genetic factors and brain functions, limiting their ability to discern complex nonlinear correlation patterns and resulting in reduced accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel nonlinear imaging genetic association analysis method, Deep Self-Reconstruction-based Adaptive Sparse Multi-view Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (DSR-AdaSMDGCCA). This approach facilitates joint learning of the nonlinear relationships between pathological phenotypes and genetic variations by integrating three different types of data: structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and gene expression data. By incorporating nonlinear transformations in DGCCA, our model effectively uncovers nonlinear associations across multiple data types. Additionally, the DSR algorithm clusters samples with identical labels, incorporating label information into the nonlinear feature extraction process and thus enhancing the performance of association analysis. The application of the DSR-AdaSMDGCCA algorithm on real data sets identified several AD risk regions (such as the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and fusiform gyrus) and risk genes (including VSIG4, NEDD4L, and PINK1), achieving maximum classification accuracy with the fewest selected features compared to baseline algorithms. Molecular biology enrichment analysis revealed that the pathways enriched by these top genes are intimately linked to AD progression, affirming that our algorithm not only improves correlation analysis performance but also identifies biologically significant markers.\n",

      "Abstract: Neurodegeneration, which manifests as several chronic and incurable diseases, is an age-related condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and poses a significant threat to the public's health for the elderly. Recent decades have experienced an alarming increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), a severe public health issue due to the ongoing development of people living in modern civilizations. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading trigger of age-related dementia. Currently, there are no efficient therapeutics to delay, stop, or reverse the disease's course development. Several studies found that dietary bioactive phytochemicals, primarily flavonoids, influence the pathophysiological processes underlying AD. Flavonoids work well as a supplement to manufactured therapies for NDDs. Flavonoids are effective in complementing synthetic approaches to treat NDDs. They are biologically active phytochemicals with promising pharmacological activities, for instance, antiviral, anti-allergic, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant effects. The production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and oxidative stress (OS) are downregulated by flavonoids, which slow the course of AD. Hence, this research turned from preclinical evidence to feasible clinical applications to develop newer therapeutics, focusing on the therapeutic potential of flavonoids against AD.\n",

      "Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and cognitive impairment, often accompanied by alterations in mood, confusion, and, ultimately, a state of acute mental disturbance. The cerebral cortex is considered a promising area for investigating the underlying causes of AD by analyzing transcriptional patterns, which could be complemented by investigating blood samples obtained from patients. We analyzed the RNA expression profiles of three distinct areas of the brain cortex, including the frontal cortex (FC), temporal cortex (TC), and entorhinal cortex (EC) in patients with AD. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across the three regions. The two genes with the most significant expression changes in the EC region were selected for assessing mRNA expression levels in the peripheral blood of late-onset AD patients using quantitative PCR (qPCR). We identified eight shared DEGs in these regions, including AEBP1 and COLEC12, which exhibited prominent changes in expression. Functional enrichment analysis uncovered a significant association of these DEGs with the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway and processes related to angiogenesis. Importantly, we established a robust connection between the up-regulation of AEBP1 and COLEC12 in both the brain and peripheral blood. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the potential of AEBP1 and COLEC12 genes as effective diagnostic tools for distinguishing between late-onset AD patients and healthy controls. This study unveils the intricate interplay between AEBP1 and COLEC12 in AD and underscores their potential as markers for disease detection and monitoring.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText>This comprehensive review delves into the potential of intranasal insulin delivery for managing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) while exploring the connection between AD and diabetes mellitus (DM). Both conditions share features of insulin signalling dysregulation and oxidative stress that accelerate inflammatory response. Given the physiological barriers to brain drug delivery, including the blood-brain barrier, intranasal administration emerges as a non-invasive alternative. Notably, intranasal insulin has shown neuroprotective effects, impacting Aβ clearance, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic plasticity. In preclinical studies and clinical trials, intranasally administered insulin achieved rapid and extensive distribution throughout the brain, with optimal formulations exhibiting minimal systemic circulation. The detailed mechanism of insulin transport through the nose-to-brain pathway is elucidated in the review, emphasizing the role of olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Despite promising prospects, challenges in delivering protein drugs from the nasal cavity to the brain remain, including enzymes, tight junctions, mucociliary clearance, and precise drug deposition, which hinder its translation to clinical settings. The review encompasses a discussion of the strategies to enhance the intranasal delivery of therapeutic proteins, such as tight junction modulators, cell-penetrating peptides, and nano-drug carrier systems. Moreover, successful translation of nose-to-brain drug delivery necessitates a holistic understanding of drug transport mechanisms, brain anatomy, and nasal formulation optimization. To date, no intranasal insulin formulation has received regulatory approval for AD treatment. Future research should address challenges related to drug absorption, nasal deposition, and the long-term effects of intranasal insulin. In this context, the evaluation of administration devices for nose-to-brain drug delivery becomes crucial in ensuring precise drug deposition patterns and enhancing bioavailability.</AbstractText>\n",
