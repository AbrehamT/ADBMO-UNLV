Targeting the autophagy-NAD axis protects against cell death in Niemann-Pick type C1 disease models.,"Impairment of autophagy leads to an accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles and has been implicated in plethora of human diseases. Loss of autophagy in actively respiring cells has also been shown to trigger metabolic collapse mediated by the depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) pools, resulting in cell death. Here we found that the deficit in the autophagy-NAD axis underpins the loss of viability in cell models of a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder, Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease. Defective autophagic flux in NPC1 cells resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction due to impairment of mitophagy, leading to the depletion of both the reduced and oxidised forms of NAD as identified via metabolic profiling. Consequently, exhaustion of the NAD pools triggered mitochondrial depolarisation and apoptotic cell death. Our chemical screening identified two FDA-approved drugs, celecoxib and memantine, as autophagy activators which effectively restored autophagic flux, NAD levels, and cell viability of NPC1 cells. Of biomedical relevance, either pharmacological rescue of the autophagy deficiency or NAD precursor supplementation restored NAD levels and improved the viability of NPC1 patient fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons. Together, our findings identify the autophagy-NAD axis as a mechanism of cell death and a target for therapeutic interventions in NPC1 disease, with a potential relevance to other neurodegenerative disorders.",6450419,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/6450419/
Time perception among people living with and without dementia: A scoping review.,"Dementia often manifests with profound alterations in perception, but it is unclear if and to what extent time perception is altered among people living with dementia compared to those experiencing normal aging. Thus, this scoping review aimed to answer the following research questions: (1) What study designs, participants, time intervals, paradigms, tests, and scores have been employed and in which countries were these methods employed to study time perception in dementia? (2) In which ways do time perception differ across individuals living with and without dementia? (3) In which ways do time perception differ across individuals living with different types of dementia? After deduplication, title and abstract screening, and full-text review, a total of 12 studies were included in this scoping review. Findings generally indicated that people living with dementia perceive time differently than people living without dementia, and that some differences across dementia diagnoses may exist, but the body of literature on time perception in dementia was quite limited. Future research should focus on replicating findings while extending the research to look beyond the dementia versus non-dementia dichotomy as differences across dementia diagnoses may exist. Moreover, if people living with dementia (and, in particular, living with different dementia diagnoses) experience time differently from those experiencing normal aging, we need to begin to address these differences in dementia-friendly initiatives to improve well-being for this population.",Not available,URL not available
Early-stage Alzheimer's disease affects fast but not slow adaptive processes in motor learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an initial decline in declarative memory, while non-declarative memory processing remains relatively intact. Error-based motor adaptation is traditionally seen as a form of non-declarative memory, but recent findings suggest that it involves both fast, declarative and slow, non-declarative adaptive processes. If the declarative memory system shares resources with the fast process in motor adaptation, it can be hypothesized that the fast, but not the slow, process is disturbed in AD patients. To test this, we studied 20 early-stage AD patients and 21 age-matched controls of both sexes using a reach adaptation paradigm that relies on spontaneous recovery after sequential exposure to opposing force fields. Adaptation was measured using error clamps and expressed as an adaptation index (AI). Although patients with AD showed slightly lower adaptation to the force field than the controls, both groups demonstrated effects of spontaneous recovery. The time course of the AI was fitted by a hierarchical Bayesian two-state model in which each dynamic state is characterized by a retention and learning rate. Compared to controls, the retention rate of the fast process was the only parameter that was significantly different (lower) in the AD patients, confirming that the memory of the declarative, fast process is disturbed by AD. The slow adaptive process was virtually unaffected. Since the slow process learns only weakly from error, our results provide neurocomputational evidence for the clinical practice of errorless learning of everyday tasks in people with dementia.",Not available,URL not available
Beyond memory impairment: the complex phenotypic landscape of Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitute multifaceted behavioral manifestations that reflect processes of emotional regulation, thinking, and social behavior. They are as prevalent in AD as cognitive impairment and develop independently during the progression of neurodegeneration. As studying NPSs in AD is clinically challenging, most AD research to date has focused on cognitive decline. In this opinion article we summarize emerging literature on the prevalence, time course, and the underlying genetic, molecular, and pathological mechanisms related to NPSs in AD. Overall, we propose that NPSs constitute a cluster of core symptoms in AD, and understanding their neurobiology can lead to a more holistic approach to AD research, paving the way for more accurate diagnostic tests and personalized treatments embracing the goals of precision medicine.",Not available,URL not available
Proteomics Profiling of Extracellular Vesicle for Identification of Potential Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: A Comprehensive Review.,"The intricate origins and diverse symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose significant challenges for both diagnosis and treatment. Exosomes and microvesicles, which carry disease-specific cargo from a variety of central nervous system cell types, have emerged as promising reservoirs of biomarkers for AD. Research on the screening of possible biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease using proteomic profiling of EVs is systematically reviewed in this comprehensive review. We highlight key methodologies employed in EV isolation, characterization, and proteomic analysis, elucidating their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we summarize the evolving landscape of EV-associated biomarkers implicated in AD pathogenesis, including proteins involved in amyloid-beta metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal injury. The literature review highlights the necessity for robust validation strategies and standardized protocols to effectively transition EV-based biomarkers into clinical use. In the concluding section, this review delves into potential future avenues and technological advancements pivotal in crafting EV-derived biomarkers applicable to AD diagnostics and prognostics. This review contributes to our comprehension of AD pathology and the advancement of precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases, hinting at a promising era in AD precision medicine.",Not available,URL not available
"Quercetin ameliorates cognitive deficit, expression of amyloid precursor gene, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in an experimental models of Alzheimer's disease in Wistar rats.","Chronic stress (CS) is critically involved in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis resulting in cognitive disturbance. Also, amyloid precursor protein (APP) related gens, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and stress increases AD-related pathogenesis through increasing APP, all are important players in the development of AD. Herein, we explore the possible neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effect of quercetin (QUER) on cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine (SCOP) in stressed rats. Stress induction was performed by exposed of rats to 2-h chronic restraint stress for 10 days. Then rats were supplemented with QUER (25 mg/kg/day oral gavage, for 1 month). Ratswere submitted to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of SCOP (1 mg/kg) during the final 9 days of QUER supplementation to induce dementia like condition. Following the interventions, behavioral tests [elevated plus maze (EPM) and novel object recognition memory (NORM)] was examined to analysis the cognitive functions. Meanwhile, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of brain were used for gene expression and biochemical studies. Also, the plasma corticosterone (CORT) level was measured. We established that administration of QUER ameliorated the SCOP-related memory impairment. Also, QUER decreased stress related anxiety like behaviors in the EPM. QUER also altered the interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in both PFC and hippocampus of SCOP treated rats in stress and non-stress conditions. We found that QUER increased APP and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) mRNA expression in both non-stress and stressed rats. Also, our findings imply that QUER suppress the effect of SCOP on cognitive functions. Moreover, decreased APP mRNA expression in the hippocampus were observed following pretreatment of rats with QUER in both stress and non-stress groups. Given that decreased amyloid beta (Aβ) expression in the hippocampus of stressed rats, it can be proposed that elevations in APP mRNA expression by QUER activates non-amyloidogenic pathways leading to reduction in Aβ levels. However, our findings indicate that QUER can be a therapeutic candidate, which exerts an anti-amnesic property against SCOP-induced memory decline. On the other hand, prior QUER administration in stress condition could be a promising approach against AD prevention.",Not available,URL not available
Inhibition of CXCR4: A perspective on miracle fruit seed for Alzheimer's disease treatment.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, and its causes are currently diverse and not fully understood. In a previous study, we discovered that short-term treatment with miracle fruit seed (MFS) had a therapeutic effect on AD model mice, however, the precise mechanism behind this effect remains unclear. In this research, we aimed to establish the efficacy and safety of long-term use of MFS in AD model mice. A variety of cytokines and chemokines have been implicated in the development of AD. Previous studies have validated a correlation between the expression levels of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and disease severity in AD. In this research, we observed an upregulation of CXCR4 expression 1n hippocampal tissues in the AD model group, which was then reversed after MFS treatment. Moreover, CXCR4 knockout resulted in improved cognitive function in AD model mice, and MFS showed the ability to regulate CXCR4 expression. Finally, our findings indicate that CXCR4 knockout and long-term MFS treatment produce comparable effects in treating AD model mice. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that therapeutic efficacy and safety of long-term use in AD model mice. MFS treatment and the subsequent reduction of CXCR4 expression exhibit a neuroprotective role in the brain, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for AD.",Not available,URL not available
Eicosanoid Signaling in Neuroinflammation Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative condition affecting a substantial portion of the global population. It is marked by a complex interplay of factors, including the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles within the brain, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Recent studies have underscored the role of free lipids and their derivatives in the initiation and progression of AD. Eicosanoids, metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids like arachidonic acid (AA), emerge as key players in this scenario. Remarkably, eicosanoids can either promote or inhibit the development of AD, and this multifaceted role is determined by how eicosanoid signaling influences the immune responses within the brain. However, the precise molecular mechanisms dictating the dual role of eicosanoids in AD remain elusive. In this comprehensive review, we explore the intricate involvement of eicosanoids in neuronal function and dysfunction. Furthermore, we assess the therapeutic potential of targeting eicosanoid signaling pathways as a viable strategy for mitigating or halting the progression of AD.",Not available,URL not available

An inducible genetic tool to track and manipulate specific microglial states reveals their plasticity and roles in remyelination.,"Recent single-cell RNA sequencing studies have revealed distinct microglial states in development and disease. These include proliferative-region-associated microglia (PAMs) in developing white matter and disease-associated microglia (DAMs) prevalent in various neurodegenerative conditions. PAMs and DAMs share a similar core gene signature. However, the extent of the dynamism and plasticity of these microglial states, as well as their functional significance, remains elusive, partly due to the lack of specific tools. Here, we generated an inducible Cre driver line, Clec7a-CreER",Not available,URL not available
Geodesic shape regression based deep learning segmentation for assessing longitudinal hippocampal atrophy in dementia progression.,"Longitudinal hippocampal atrophy is commonly used as progressive marker assisting clinical diagnose of dementia. However, precise quantification of the atrophy is limited by longitudinal segmentation errors resulting from MRI artifacts across multiple independent scans. To accurately segment the hippocampal morphology from longitudinal 3T T1-weighted MR images, we propose a diffeomorphic geodesic guided deep learning method called the GeoLongSeg to mitigate the longitudinal variabilities that unrelated to diseases by enhancing intra-individual morphological consistency. Specifically, we integrate geodesic shape regression, an evolutional model that estimates smooth deformation process of anatomical shapes, into a two-stage segmentation network. We adopt a 3D U-Net in the first-stage network with an enhanced attention mechanism for independent segmentation. Then, a hippocampal shape evolutional trajectory is estimated by geodesic shape regression and fed into the second network to refine the independent segmentation. We verify that GeoLongSeg outperforms other four state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines in longitudinal morphological consistency evaluated by test-retest reliability, variance ratio and atrophy trajectories. When assessing hippocampal atrophy in longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), results based on GeoLongSeg exhibit spatial and temporal local atrophy in bilateral hippocampi of dementia patients. These features derived from GeoLongSeg segmentation exhibit the greatest discriminatory capability compared to the outcomes of other methods in distinguishing between patients and normal controls. Overall, GeoLongSeg provides an accurate and efficient segmentation network for extracting hippocampal morphology from longitudinal MR images, which assist precise atrophy measurement of the hippocampus in early stage of dementia.",Not available,URL not available
Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy: Research hotspots for comorbidity in the era of global aging.,"Neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy share a significant clinical overlap, particularly in the elderly, with each disorder potentiating the risk of the other. This interplay is significant amidst an aging global demographic. The review explores the classical pathologies of AD, including amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau, and their potential role in the genesis of epilepsy. It also delves into the imbalance of glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid activities, a key mechanism in epilepsy that may be influenced by AD pathology. The impact of age of onset on comorbidity is examined, with early-onset AD and Down syndrome presenting higher risks of epilepsy. The review suggests that epilepsy might precede cognitive symptoms in AD, indicating a complex interaction. Sleep modulation is highlighted as a factor, with sleep disturbances potentially contributing to AD progression. The necessity for cautious medication management is emphasized due to the cognitive effects of certain antiepileptic drugs. Animal models are recognized for their importance in understanding the relationship between AD and epilepsy, though creating fully representative models presents a challenge. The review concludes by noting the efficacy of medications such as lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and memantine in managing both conditions and suggests the ketogenic diet and cannabidiol as emerging treatment options, warranting further investigation for comprehensive patient care strategies.",Not available,URL not available
Identification of pleiotropic and specific therapeutic targets for cardio-cerebral diseases: A large-scale proteome-wide mendelian randomization and colocalization study.,"The cardiac-brain connection has been identified as the basis for multiple cardio-cerebral diseases.

Therefore, this study aimed to identify pleiotropic and specific therapeutic targets for cardio-cerebral diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses.",Not available,URL not available
Towards cascading genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease typically progresses in stages, which have been defined by the presence of disease-specific biomarkers: Amyloid (A), Tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N). This progression of biomarkers has been condensed into the ATN framework, where each of the biomarkers can be either positive (+) or negative (-). Over the past decades genome wide association studies have implicated about 90 different loci involved with the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease. Here we investigate whether genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease contributes equally to the progression in different disease stages or whether it exhibits a stage-dependent effect. Amyloid (A) and tau (T) status was defined using a combination of available PET and CSF biomarkers in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. In 312 participants with biomarker-confirmed A-T- status, we employed Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the contribution of APOE and polygenic risk scores (beyond APOE) to convert to A+T- status (65 conversions). Furthermore, we repeated the analysis in 290 participants with A+T- status and investigated the genetic contribution to conversion to A+T+ (45 conversions). Both survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education. For progression from A-T- to A+T-, APOE-e4 burden showed significant effect (HR=2.88; 95% CI: 1.70-4.89; P<0.001), while polygenic risk did not (HR=1.09; 95% CI: 0.84-1.42; P=0.53). Conversely, for the transition from A+T- to A+T+, the APOE-e4 burden contribution was reduced (HR=1.62 95% CI: 1.05-2.51; P=0.031), while the polygenic risk showed an increased contribution (HR=1.73; 95% CI:1.27-2.36; P<0.001). The marginal APOE effect was driven by e4 homozygotes (HR=2.58; 95% CI: 1.05-6.35; P=0.039) as opposed to e4 heterozygotes (HR=1.74; 95% CI: 0.87-3.49; P=0.12). The genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease unfolds in a disease stage-dependent fashion. A better understanding of the interplay between disease stage and genetic risk can lead to a more mechanistic understanding of transition between ATN stages, a better understanding of the molecular processes leading to Alzheimer's disease as well as opening therapeutic windows for targeted interventions.",Not available,URL not available
Localized Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5) Reductions Present Throughout the Dementia with Lewy Bodies Brain.,"Localized pantothenic acid deficiencies have been observed in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and Huntington's disease (HD), indicating downstream energetic pathway perturbations.

"Microglia-astrocyte crosstalk in the amyloid plaque niche of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, as revealed by spatial transcriptomics.","The amyloid plaque niche is a pivotal hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we employ two high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) platforms, CosMx and Spatial Enhanced Resolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), to characterize the transcriptomic alterations, cellular compositions, and signaling perturbations in the amyloid plaque niche in an AD mouse model. We discover heterogeneity in the cellular composition of plaque niches, marked by an increase in microglial accumulation. We profile the transcriptomic alterations of glial cells in the vicinity of plaques and conclude that the microglial response to plaques is consistent across different brain regions, while the astrocytic response is more heterogeneous. Meanwhile, as the microglial density of plaque niches increases, astrocytes acquire a more neurotoxic phenotype and play a key role in inducing GABAergic signaling and decreasing glutamatergic signaling in hippocampal neurons. We thus show that the accumulation of microglia around hippocampal plaques disrupts astrocytic signaling, in turn inducing an imbalance in neuronal synaptic signaling.",Not available,URL not available
Strengthening Primary Care Workforce Capacity in Dementia Diagnosis and Care: A Qualitative Study of Project Alzheimer's Disease-ECHO.,"Primary care practitioners (PCPs) are the first point of contact for most patients with suspected dementia and have identified a need for more training and support around dementia diagnosis and care. This qualitative study examined the Alzheimer's Disease-Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (AD-ECHO) program. AD-ECHO was designed to strengthen PCP capacity in dementia through bimonthly virtual meetings with a team of dementia experts. We conducted 24 hr of direct observations at AD-ECHO sessions and interviewed 14 participants about their experiences participating. Using thematic analysis, we found that participants valued the supportive learning environment and resources; knowledge gained empowered them to take more action around dementia; they identified ways of disseminating knowledge gained into their practice settings, and many desired ongoing AD-ECHO engagement. However, most identified time as a barrier to participation.

AdipoRon Ameliorates Synaptic Dysfunction and Inhibits tau Hyperphosphorylation through the AdipoR/AMPK/mTOR Pathway in T2DM Mice.,"There is growing evidence showing that adiponectin (APN) can improve Alzheimer's disease(AD)-like pathological changes by improving insulin resistance. However, the role of AdipoRon (an Adiponectin receptor agonist) on synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunction in the early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of AdipoRon in T2DM mice. We found that AdipoRon significantly restored the cognitive deficits in T2DM mice, including shorter escape latency, more crossing times, increased distances, and percentage of time in the target quadrant. In addition, AdipoRon treatment up-regulated synaptic proteins (PSD95, SYN, GAP43, and SYP), increased the number of hippocampal synapses and attenuated synaptic damage, including the length, the number and the density of dendritic spines in CA1 and DG regions. Furthermore, AdipoRon attenuated Tau phosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites (p-tau 205, p-tau 396, p-tau 404) by promoting AdipoR expression and activating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Our data suggests that AdipoRon exerts neuroprotective effects on the T2DM mice, which may be mediated by the activation of the AdipoR/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.",9661919,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/9661919/
Nanoinjection: A Platform for Innovation in Ex Vivo Cell Engineering.,"ConspectusIn human cells, intracellular access and therapeutic cargo transport, including gene-editing tools (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 and transposons), nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, mRNA, and siRNA), peptides, and proteins (e.g., enzymes and antibodies), are tightly constrained to ensure healthy cell function and behavior. This principle is exemplified in the delivery mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells for ex-vivo immunotherapy. In particular, the clinical success of CAR-T cells has established a new standard of care by curing previously incurable blood cancers. The approach involves the delivery, typically via the use of electroporation (EP) and lentivirus, of therapeutic CAR genes into a patient's own T cells, which are then engineered to express CARs that target and combat their blood cancer. But the key difficulty lies in genetically manipulating these cells without causing irreversible damage or loss of function─all the while minimizing complexities of manufacturing, safety concerns, and costs, and ensuring the efficacy of the final CAR-T cell product.Nanoinjection─the process of intracellular delivery using nanoneedles (NNs)─is an emerging physical delivery route that efficiently negotiates the plasma membrane of many cell types, including primary human T cells. It occurs with minimal perturbation, invasiveness, and toxicity, with high efficiency and throughput at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Nanoinjection promises greatly improved delivery of a broad range of therapeutic cargos with little or no damage to those cargos. A nanoinjection platform allows these cargos to function in the intracellular space as desired. The adaptability of nanoinjection platforms is now bringing major advantages in immunomodulation, mechanotransduction, sampling of cell states (nanobiopsy), controlled intracellular interrogation, and the primary focus of this account─intracellular delivery and its applications in ex vivo cell engineering.Mechanical nanoinjection typically exerts direct mechanical force on the cell membrane, offering a straightforward route to improve membrane perturbation by the NNs and subsequent transport of genetic cargo into targeted cell type (adherent or suspension cells). By contrast, electroactive nanoinjection is controlled by coupling NNs with an electric field─a new route for activating electroporation (EP) at the nanoscale─allowing a dramatic reduction of the applied voltage to a cell and so minimizing post-EP damage to cells and cargo, and overcoming many of the limitations of conventional bulk EP. Nanoinjection transcends mere technique; it is an approach to cell engineering ex vivo, offering the potential to endow cells with new, powerful features such as generating chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells for future CAR-T cell technologies.We first discuss the manufacturing of NN devices (Section 2), then delve into nanoinjection-mediated cell engineering (Section 3), nanoinjection mechanisms and interfacing methodologies (Section 4), and emerging applications in using nanoinjection to create functional CAR-T cells (Section 5).",Not available,URL not available
New insights into sodium phenylbutyrate as a pharmacotherapeutic option for neurological disorders.,"Neurological disorders (NDs) are diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems that affect more than one billion people worldwide. The risk of developing an ND increases with age due to the vulnerability of the different organs and systems to genetic, environmental, and social changes that consequently cause motor and cognitive deficits that disable the person from their daily activities and individual and social productivity. Intrinsic factors (genetic factors, age, gender) and extrinsic factors (addictions, infections, or lifestyle) favor the persistence of systemic inflammatory processes that contribute to the evolution of NDs. Neuroinflammation is recognized as a common etiopathogenic factor of ND. The study of new pharmacological options for the treatment of ND should focus on improving the characteristic symptoms and attacking specific molecular targets that allow the delay of damage processes such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, cellular metabolic dysfunction, and deregulation of transcriptional processes. In this review, we describe the possible role of sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, hepatic encephalopathy, aging, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; in addition, we describe the mechanism of action of NaPB and its beneficial effects that have been shown in various in vivo and in vitro studies to delay the evolution of any ND.",Not available,URL not available
Alzheimer Disease-Link With Major Depressive Disorder and Efficacy of Antidepressants in Modifying its Trajectory.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide, with no effective cure. The main symptoms include learning and memory loss, and the inability to carry out the simplest tasks, significantly affecting patients' quality of life. Over the past few years, tremendous progress has been made in research demonstrating a link between AD and major depressive disorder (MDD). Evidence suggests that MDD is commonly associated with AD and that it can serve as a precipitating factor for this disease. Antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are the first line of treatment for MDD, have shown great promise in the treatment of depression in AD, although their effectiveness remains controversial. The goal of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the association between AD, MDD, and antidepressant treatment. It first provides an overview of the interaction between AD and MDD at the level of genes, brain regions, neurotransmitter systems, and neuroinflammatory markers. The review then presents current evidence regarding the effectiveness of various antidepressants for AD-related pathophysiology and then finally discusses current limitations, challenges, and future directions.",Not available,URL not available
Chronic stress induces Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies through DNA damage-Chk1-CIP2A signaling.,"Stress is an important initiating factor in promoting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the mechanism by which stress induces AD-like cognitive impairment remains to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that DNA damage is increased in stress hormone Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-treated cells and in brains of mice exposed to chronic restraint stress. Accumulation of DNA damage drives activation of cell cycle checkpoint protein kinase 1 (Chk1), upregulation of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), tau hyperphosphorylation, and Aβ overproduction, eventually resulting in synaptic impairment and cognitive deficits. Pharmacological intervention targeting Chk1 by specific inhibitor and DNA damage by vitamin C, suppress DNA damage-Chk1-CIP2A signaling pathway in chronic stress animal model, which in turn attenuate AD-like pathologies, synaptic impairments and cognitive deficits. Our study uncovers a novel molecular mechanism of stress-induced AD-like pathologies and provides effective preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting this signaling pathway.",Not available,URL not available
Daphnetin protects neurons in an Alzheimer disease mouse model and normal rat neurons by inhibiting BACE1 activity and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.,"The common neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by memory dysfunction and cognitive decline in the elderly. Neuropathological features include aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the brain. Daphnetin (DAPH), a natural coumarin derivative, has the potential for inhibiting inflammatory and oxidative responses. We explored neuroprotective roles of DAPH treatment in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse AD model. DAPH ameliorated spatial learning disabilities in Morris water maze tests and reduced Aβ deposition, assessed by immunohistochemistry. It also reduced the Aβ content in supernatants of neurons from fetal APP/PS1 mice, assessed by cell-based soluble ELISA. Molecular docking and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay results suggested that DAPH could directly inhibit BACE1 activity. Furthermore, in vitro experiments utilizing isolated rat neurons assessing RNA expression profiling, immunofluorescence, TUNEL assay, and Western-blot analysis, suggested the potential of DAPH for regulating BDNF and GM-CSF expression and mitigating Aβ1-42-induced cortical injury, synaptic loss, and apoptosis. HO-1 and Nrf2 mRNA and protein expression were also increased in a dose-dependent manner. These results underscore the potential of DAPH as a neuroprotective agent in reversing memory deficits associated with AD and bolster its candidacy as a multitarget natural small-molecule drug for AD patients.",Not available,URL not available

However, the functional role of GGT5 in the development of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of GGT5 on cognitive function and brain pathology in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the underlying mechanism. We observed a significant reduction in GGT5 expression in two in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease (Aβ1-42-treated hCMEC/D3 and bEnd.3 cells), as well as in the APP/PS1 mouse model. Additionally, injection of APP/PS1 mice with an adeno-associated virus encoding GGT5 enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and mitigated cognitive deficits. Interestingly, increasing GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells reduced levels of both soluble and insoluble amyloid-β in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. This effect may be attributable to inhibition of the expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, which is mediated by nuclear factor-kappa B. Our findings demonstrate that GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells is inversely associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and that GGT5 upregulation mitigates cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggest that GGT5 expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells is a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.",Not available,URL not available
Overexpression of low-density lipoprotein receptor prevents neurotoxic polarization of astrocytes via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in experimental ischemic stroke.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202502000-00027/figure1/v/2024-05-28T214302Z/r/image-tiff Neurotoxic astrocytes are a promising therapeutic target for the attenuation of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Low-density lipoprotein receptor, a classic cholesterol regulatory receptor, has been found to inhibit NLR family pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in neurons following ischemic stroke and to suppress the activation of microglia and astrocytes in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about the effects of low-density lipoprotein receptor on astrocytic activation in ischemic stroke. To address this issue in the present study, we examined the mechanisms by which low-density lipoprotein receptor regulates astrocytic polarization in ischemic stroke models. First, we examined low-density lipoprotein receptor expression in astrocytes via immunofluorescence staining and western blotting analysis. We observed significant downregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor following middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Second, we induced the astrocyte-specific overexpression of low-density lipoprotein receptor using astrocyte-specific adeno-associated virus. Low-density lipoprotein receptor overexpression in astrocytes improved neurological outcomes in middle cerebral artery occlusion mice and reversed neurotoxic astrocytes to create a neuroprotective phenotype. Finally, we found that the overexpression of low-density lipoprotein receptor inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation injured astrocytes and that the addition of nigericin, an NLRP3 agonist, restored the neurotoxic astrocyte phenotype. These findings suggest that low-density lipoprotein receptor could inhibit the NLRP3-meidiated neurotoxic polarization of astrocytes and that increasing low-density lipoprotein receptor in astrocytes might represent a novel strategy for treating cerebral ischemic stroke.",Not available,URL not available
P2Y1 receptor in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent form of dementia characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau. Targeting amyloid-beta plaques has been a primary direction for developing Alzheimer's disease treatments in the last decades. However, existing drugs targeting amyloid-beta plaques have not fully yielded the expected results in the clinic, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Increasing evidence unravels that astrocyte morphology and function alter in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, with dysregulated astrocytic purinergic receptors, particularly the P2Y1 receptor, all of which constitute the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. These receptors are not only crucial for maintaining normal astrocyte function but are also highly implicated in neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. This review delves into recent insights into the association between P2Y1 receptor and Alzheimer's disease to underscore the potential neuroprotective role of P2Y1 receptor in Alzheimer's disease by mitigating neuroinflammation, thus offering promising avenues for developing drugs for Alzheimer's disease and potentially contributing to the development of more effective treatments.",Not available,URL not available
Nanomaterials-mediated lysosomal regulation: a robust protein-clearance approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal proteins, including amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles, primarily within the brain. Lysosomes, crucial intracellular organelles responsible for protein degradation, play a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Some studies have suggested a link between the dysregulation of the lysosomal system and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Restoring the normal physiological function of lysosomes hold the potential to reduce the pathological burden and improve the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, the efficacy of drugs in treating Alzheimer's disease is limited, with major challenges in drug delivery efficiency and targeting. Recently, nanomaterials have gained widespread use in Alzheimer's disease drug research owing to their favorable physical and chemical properties. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in using nanomaterials (polymeric nanomaterials, nanoemulsions, and carbon-based nanomaterials) to enhance lysosomal function in treating Alzheimer's disease. This review also explores new concepts and potential therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease through the integration of nanomaterials and modulation of lysosomal function. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the potential of nanomaterials in modulating lysosomal function to improve the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. The application of nanotechnology to the development of Alzheimer's disease drugs brings new ideas and approaches for future treatment of this disease.",Not available,URL not available
Interleukin 1β receptor and synaptic dysfunction in recurrent brain infection with Herpes simplex virus type-1.,"Several experimental evidence suggests a link between brain Herpes simplex virus type-1 infection and the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association are not completely understood. Among the molecular mediators of synaptic and cognitive dysfunction occurring after Herpes simplex virus type-1 infection and reactivation in the brain neuroinflammatory cytokines seem to occupy a central role. Here, we specifically reviewed literature reports dealing with the impact of neuroinflammation on synaptic dysfunction observed after recurrent Herpes simplex virus type-1 reactivation in the brain, highlighting the role of interleukins and, in particular, interleukin 1β as a possible target against Herpes simplex virus type-1-induced neuronal dysfunctions.",Not available,URL not available
The emerging role of nitric oxide in the synaptic dysfunction of vascular dementia.,"With an increase in global aging, the number of people affected by cerebrovascular diseases is also increasing, and the incidence of vascular dementia-closely related to cerebrovascular risk-is increasing at an epidemic rate. However, few therapeutic options exist that can markedly improve the cognitive impairment and prognosis of vascular dementia patients. Similarly in Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders, synaptic dysfunction is recognized as the main reason for cognitive decline. Nitric oxide is one of the ubiquitous gaseous cellular messengers involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes of the central nervous system. Recently, nitric oxide has been implicated in regulating synaptic plasticity and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia. This review introduces in detail the emerging role of nitric oxide in physiological and pathological states of vascular dementia and summarizes the diverse effects of nitric oxide on different aspects of synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction that underlie the progress of vascular dementia. Additionally, we propose that targeting the nitric oxide-sGC-cGMP pathway using certain specific approaches may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for vascular dementia.",Not available,URL not available
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in Alzheimer's disease: effects on neural and synaptic rehabilitation.,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from deficits in synaptic transmission and homeostasis. The Alzheimer's disease brain tends to be hyperexcitable and hypersynchronized, thereby causing neurodegeneration and ultimately disrupting the operational abilities in daily life, leaving patients incapacitated. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a cost-effective, neuro-modulatory technique used for multiple neurological conditions. Over the past two decades, it has been widely used to predict cognitive decline; identify pathophysiological markers; promote neuroplasticity; and assess brain excitability, plasticity, and connectivity. It has also been applied to patients with dementia, because it can yield facilitatory effects on cognition and promote brain recovery after a neurological insult. However, its therapeutic effectiveness at the molecular and synaptic levels has not been elucidated because of a limited number of studies. This study aimed to characterize the neurobiological changes following repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment, evaluate its effects on synaptic plasticity, and identify the associated mechanisms. This review essentially focuses on changes in the pathology, amyloidogenesis, and clearance pathways, given that amyloid deposition is a major hypothesis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Apoptotic mechanisms associated with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation procedures and different pathways mediating gene transcription, which are closely related to the neural regeneration process, are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss the outcomes of animal studies in which neuroplasticity is modulated and assessed at the structural and functional levels by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, with the aim to highlight future directions for better clinical translations.",Not available,URL not available
Phonological processing in Chinese word repetition: Dementia effect and age effect.,"This paper examined phonological processing as reflected in Mandarin word and non-word repetition. Issues related to dementia effects, age effects, and linguistic variables are discussed. Forty-five speakers of Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan took part in this study. Fourteen seniors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 14 healthy adults, and 17 healthy seniors individually completed a task of word repetition. Scores of accurate repetition were calculated, and error types as well as error frequency were analysed. Linguistic variables, including lexicality, frequency, non-word, and syllable length, were discussed. Major findings were indicative of a significant dementia effect, in which participants with AD were significantly impaired in repeating words with more syllables, specifically 5-syllable non-words of low frequency. Numerous significant age effects were noted. Theoretical implications and directions for future study are discussed.",Not available,URL not available

[Blood biomarkers open a window to brain pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease].,"Technical developments have paved the way for the development of ultrasensitive analytical methods that allow for precise quantification of brain-specific proteins in blood samples. Plasma levels of amyloid β, specifically the Aβ42/40 ratio, are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and show concordance with brain amyloidosis assessed by PET, but the overlap with normal elderly may be too large for reliable use in clinical applications. Plasma phosphorylated tau (P-tau), especially a variant called P-tau217, is markedly increased in the early symptomatic stages of AD but remains normal in other neurodegenerative disorders. Total tau (T-tau) is measurable in blood and shows most promise as a biomarker for acute neuronal injury (e.g. acute traumatic or hypoxic brain injury), where T-tau shows a fast and dramatic increase but does not work well as an AD biomarker due to contributions to blood levels from peripheral tissues. Instead, a novel method for tau protein produced only in the CNS called brain-derived tau (BD-tau) shows promise as a biomarker for AD-type neurodegeneration. Neurofilament light (NFL) levels in blood correlate tightly with levels in CSF and reflect axonal injury irrespective of the underlying cause. Increased blood NFL concentration is found in several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, but even more so in disorders such as motor neuron disease and frontotemporal dementia. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed with activation of astrocytes, and is mildly increased in AD, but is also very high also in acute brain disorders. These blood tests show promise as tools to identify AD pathophysiology in the first assessment of patients with early cognitive symptoms, also in primary care, to guide clinical management and possible admission to the specialist clinic. A two-step model will result in a very high accuracy to either predict or exclude brain amyloidosis of the Alzheimer type.",Not available,URL not available
Potential molecular mechanism of exercise reversing insulin resistance and improving neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are debilitating nervous system disorders attributed to various conditions such as body aging, gene mutations, genetic factors, and immune system disorders. Prominent neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Insulin resistance refers to the inability of the peripheral and central tissues of the body to respond to insulin and effectively regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance has been observed in various neurodegenerative diseases and has been suggested to induce the occurrence, development, and exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies have suggested that reversing insulin resistance may be a critical intervention for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Among the numerous measures available to improve insulin sensitivity, exercise is a widely accepted strategy due to its convenience, affordability, and significant impact on increasing insulin sensitivity. This review examines the association between neurodegenerative diseases and insulin resistance and highlights the molecular mechanisms by which exercise can reverse insulin resistance under these conditions. The focus was on regulating insulin resistance through exercise and providing practical ideas and suggestions for future research focused on exercise-induced insulin sensitivity in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.",PMC11137309,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137309/

Heavy metals toxicity on epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive decline in cognitive ability and behavior which eventually disrupts daily activities. AD has no cure and the progression rate varies unlikely. Among various causative factors, heavy metals are reported to be a significant hazard in AD pathogenesis. Metal-induced neurodegeneration has been focused globally with thorough research to unravel the mechanistic insights in AD. Recently, heavy metals suggested to play an important role in epigenetic alterations which might provide evidential results on AD pathology. Epigenetic modifications are known to play towards novel therapeutic approaches in treating AD. Though many studies focus on epigenetics and heavy metal implications in AD, there is a lack of research on heavy metal influence on epigenetic toxicity in neurological disorders. The current review aims to elucidate the plausible role of cadmium (Cd), iron (Fe), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), and lithium (Li) metals on epigenetic factors and the increase in amyloid beta and tau phosphorylation in AD. Also, the review discusses the common methods of heavy metal detection to implicate in AD pathogenesis. Hence, from this review, we can extend the need for future research on identifying the mechanistic behavior of heavy metals on epigenetic toxicity and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic markers in AD.",Not available,URL not available

Exploring the lived experiences and care challenges of formal paid caregivers for people with intellectual disability and dementia.,"A greater number of people with intellectual disability are living into older age and are at increased risk of developing conditions such as dementia. Caring for a person with dementia presents several challenges for formal caregivers due to the progressive nature of the disease. An interpretive phenomenological analysis was used to understand the lived experiences of a purposive sample of formal caregivers in caring for people with intellectual disability and dementia. Discussions from 14 individual interviews generated data were analysed. Four key super-ordinate themes emerged which were: (1) recognising early indicators and diagnosis, (2) post diagnostic support, (3) coping with change and (4) need for future development. Themes reflected the experiences, barriers to dementia diagnosis and provide a valuable insight into the challenges faced by formal caregivers in providing aged care services.",Not available,URL not available
"Identification of vilazodone as a novel plasminogen activator inhibitor to overcome Alzheimer's disease through virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, and biological evaluation.","Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU), a member of the S1 serine peptidase family in Clan PA, plays a crucial role in the conversion of plasminogen into active plasmin. However, the precise role of PLAU in the central nervous system remains incompletely elucidated, particularly, in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we successfully identified that PLAU could promote cell senescence in neurons, indicating it as a potential target for AD treatment through a systematic approach, which included both bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification. Subsequently, a structure-based virtual screening approach was employed to identify a potential PLAU inhibitor from the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug database. After analyzing docking scores and thoroughly examining the receptor-ligand complex interaction modes, vilazodone emerges as a highly promising PLAU inhibitor. Additionally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to generate a complex structure between the relatively stable inhibitor vilazodone and PLAU. Of note, vilazodone exhibited superior cytotoxicity against senescent cells, showing a senolytic activity through targeting PLAU and ultimately producing an anti-AD effect. These findings suggest that targeting PLAU could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. Furthermore, investigating the inhibitory potential and structural modifications based on vilazodone may provide valuable insights for future drug development targeting PLAU in AD disorders.",Not available,URL not available

Emerging Pro-neurogenic Therapeutic Strategies for Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review of Pre-clinical and Clinical Research.,"The neuroscience community has largely accepted the notion that functional neurons can be generated from neural stem cells in the adult brain, especially in two brain regions: the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. However, impaired neurogenesis has been observed in some neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, and also in Lewy Body dementia. Therefore, restoration of neurogenic function in neurodegenerative diseases emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract, or at least delay, disease progression. Considering this, the present study summarizes the different neuronal niches, provides a collection of the therapeutic potential of different pro-neurogenic strategies in pre-clinical and clinical research, providing details about their possible modes of action, to guide future research and clinical practice.",7550688,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/7550688/
Role of PIM Kinase Inhibitor in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is the most prevalent form of senile dementia, causing progressive deterioration of cognition, behavior, and rational skills. Neuropathologically, AD is characterized by two hallmark proteinaceous aggregates: amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed of hyperphosphorylated tau. A significant study has been done to understand how Aβ and/or tau accumulation can alter signaling pathways that affect neuronal function. A conserved protein kinase known as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is essential for maintaining the proper balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Overwhelming evidence shows mTOR signaling's primary role in age-dependent cognitive decline and the pathogenesis of AD. Postmortem human AD brains consistently show an upregulation of mTOR signaling.

Oligomeric Tau-induced oxidative damage and functional alterations in cerebral endothelial cells: Role of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.,"Despite of yet unknown mechanism, microvascular deposition of oligomeric Tau (oTau) has been implicated in alteration of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. In this study, we employed an in vitro BBB model using primary mouse cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) to investigate the mechanism underlying the effects of oTau on BBB function. We found that exposing CECs to oTau induced oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase, increased oxidative damage to proteins, decreased proteasome activity, and expressions of tight junction (TJ) proteins including occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5. These effects were suppressed by the pretreatment with Fasudil, a RhoA/ROCK signaling inhibitor. Consistent with the biochemical alterations, we found that exposing the basolateral side of CECs to oTau in the BBB model disrupted the integrity of the BBB, as indicated by an increase in FITC-dextran transport across the model, and a decrease in trans endothelial electrical resistance (TEER). oTau also increased the transmigration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the BBB model. These functional alterations in the BBB induced by oTau were also suppressed by Fasudil. Taken together, our findings suggest that targeting the RhoA/ROCK pathway can be a potential therapeutic strategy to maintain BBB function in AD.",Not available,URL not available

Oxygen-enriching triphase platform for reliable sensing of femtomolar Alzheimer's neurofilament lights.,"Accurate quantification of neurofilament lights (NfLs), a prognostic blood biomarker, is highly required to predict neurodegeneration in the presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report self-oxygen-enriching coral structures with triphase interfaces for the label-free photocathodic detection of NfLs in blood plasma with femtomolar sensitivities and high reliability. In conventional photocathodic immunoassays, the poor solubility and sluggish diffusion rate of the dissolved oxygen serving as electron acceptors have necessitated the incorporation of additional electron acceptors or aeration procedures. To address the challenge, we designed the coral-like copper bismuth oxides (CBO) with robust solid-liquid-air contact boundaries that enrich the interfacial oxygen levels without an external aeration source. By optimally assembling the perfluorododecyltrichlorosilane (FTCS) and platinum (Pt) co-catalysts into the silver-doped CBO (Ag:CBO), the stable solid-liquid-air contact boundaries were formed within the sensor interfaces, which allowed for the abundant supply of air phase oxygen through an air pocket connected to the atmosphere. The Pt/FTCS-Ag:CBO exhibited the stable background signals independent of the dissolved oxygen fluctuations and amplified photocurrent signals by 1.76-fold, which were attributed to the elevated interfacial oxygen levels and 11.15 times-lowered mass transport resistance. Under the illumination of white light-emitting diode, the oxygen-enriching photocathodic sensor composed of Pt/FTCS-Ag:CBO conjugated with NfLs-specific antibodies precisely quantified the NfLs in plasma with a low coefficient of variation (≤2.97%), a high degree of recovery (>97.0%), and a limit of detection of 40.38 fg/mL, which was 140 times lower than the typical photocathodic sensor with diphase interfaces.",Not available,URL not available

Pharmacological modulation of septins restores calcium homeostasis and is neuroprotective in models of Alzheimer's disease.,"Abnormal calcium signaling is a central pathological component of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we describe the identification of a class of compounds called ReS19-T, which are able to restore calcium homeostasis in cell-based models of tau pathology. Aberrant tau accumulation leads to uncontrolled activation of store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) by remodeling septin filaments at the cell cortex. Binding of ReS19-T to septins restores filament assembly in the disease state and restrains calcium entry through SOCCs. In amyloid-β and tau-driven mouse models of disease, ReS19-T agents restored synaptic plasticity, normalized brain network activity, and attenuated the development of both amyloid-β and tau pathology.

"Hederagenin reduces Aβ-induced oxidative damage, decreases Aβ deposition and promotes cell survival by the P13 K/Akt signaling pathway.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. β-amyloid (Aβ) is one of the typical pathological features of AD, and its accumulation leads to neuronal death from oxidative stress. Here, we found that hederagenin (HG), a natural product, exhibits anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-depressant, anti-neurodegenerative biological activities. However, whether HG has anti-Aβ activity remains unclear. Based on the characteristics of HG, it is hypothesized that HG has biological activity against Aβ injury. Therefore, Aβ-injured SH-SY5Y cells were constructed, and the protective effect of HG against Aβ injury was further evaluated using C. elegans. The results showed that HG increased superoxide dismutase activity, effectively reduced Aβ-induced oxidative damage, and reduced apoptosis via the PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway.

Effect of blood collection tube containing protease inhibitors on the pre-analytical stability of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers.,"The reliability of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be compromised by protease-induced degradation. This can limit the feasibility of conducting plasma biomarker studies in environments that lack the capacity for immediate processing and appropriate storage of blood samples. We hypothesized that blood collection tube supplementation with protease inhibitors can improve the stability of plasma biomarkers at room temperatures (RT). In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of blood biomarker stability in traditional ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes versus BD™ P100 collection tubes, the latter being coated with a protease inhibitor cocktail. The stability of six plasma AD biomarkers was evaluated over time under RT conditions. We evaluated three experimental approaches. In Approach 1, pooled plasma samples underwent storage at RT for up to 96 h. In Approach 2, plasma samples isolated upfront from whole blood collected into EDTA or P100 tubes were stored at RT for 0 h or 24 h before biomarker measurements. In Approach 3, whole blood samples were collected into paired EDTA and P100 tubes, followed by storage at RT for 0 h or 24 h before isolating the plasma for analyses. Biomarkers were measured with Single Molecule Array (Simoa) and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays. Both the IP-MS and Simoa methods revealed that the use of P100 tubes significantly improves the stability of Aβ42 and Aβ40 across all approaches. However, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio levels were significantly stabilized only in the IP-MS assay in Approach 3. No significant differences were observed in the levels of plasma p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL for samples collected using either tube type in any of the approaches. Supplementation of blood collection tubes with protease inhibitors could reduce the protease-induced degradation of plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40, and the Aβ42/40 ratio for the IP-MS assay.

Atrial Fibrillation and Cognitive Disorders.,"The prevalence of atrial fibrillation among older adults is increasing. Research has indicated that atrial fibrillation is linked to cognitive impairment disorders such as Alzheimer and vascular dementia, as well as Parkinson disease.

The specific pathologies and mechanisms of different cognitive disorders are still being studied. Potential mechanisms include cerebral hypoperfusion, ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction, and cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study of the Self-Assembly of Tau-Derived PHF6 and Its Inhibition by Oleuropein Aglycone from Extra Virgin Olive Oil.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other taupathies are neurodegenerative disorders associated with the amyloid deposition of the Tau protein in the brain. This amyloid formation may be inhibited by small molecules, which is recognized as one of the best therapeutic strategies to stop the progression of the disease. This work focuses on the small nucleating segment, hexapeptide-paired helical filament 6 (PHF6), responsible for Tau aggregation. Using computational modeling and classical molecular dynamics simulations, we show that PHF6 monomers collapse in water to form β-sheet rich structures, and the main olive oil polyphenol oleuropein aglycone (OleA) prevents peptide aggregation significantly. We gradually increase the ratio of the PHF6-OleA from 1:1 to 1:3 and find that for the 1:1 ratio, the peptide monomers are prone to form aggregated structures, while for the 1:2 ratio, the formation of the extended β-sheet structure is significantly less. For a 1:3 ratio of protein/OleA, the peptide residues are sufficiently crowded by OleA molecules through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and π-π stacking; hence, the peptide chains prefer to exist in a monomeric random coil conformation.",Not available,URL not available
Elevated calcineurin activity in primary astrocytes leads to the dephosphorylation of connexin 43 in conjunction with increased membrane permeability.,"Hyperactivation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CN) is observed in reactive astrocytes associated with neuroinflammation and progressive degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. Apart from key transcription factors (e.g. nuclear factor of activated t cells and nuclear factor-κB) very few other CN-dependent pathways have been studied in astrocytes. The hemichannel protein, connexin 43 (Cx43) is found at high levels in astrocytes and contains a CN-sensitive Ser residue near its carboxy terminus. CN-dependent dephosphorylation of Cx43 has been reported in primary astrocytes treated with injurious stimuli, but much remains unknown about CN/Cx43 interactions in the context of neuroinflammation and disease. Western blots were used to assess total Cx43 and dephosphorylated Cx43 subtypes in rat embryonic primary astrocytes treated with a hyperactive CN fragment (ΔCN, via adenovirus), or with a proinflammatory cytokine cocktail. Under similar treatment conditions, an ethidium bromide (EtBr) uptake assay was used to assess membrane permeability. Effects of ΔCN and cytokines were tested in the presence or absence of the CN inhibitor, cyclosporin A. A connexin inhibitor, carbenoxolone was also used in EtBr assays to assess the involvement of connexins in membrane permeability. Treatment with ΔCN or cytokines increased dephosphorylated Cx43 levels in conjunction with increased membrane permeability (elevated EtBr uptake). Effects of ΔCN or cytokine treatment were blocked by cyclosporine A. Treatment-induced changes in EtBr uptake were also inhibited by carbenoxolone. The results suggest that Cx43 hemichannels could be an important mechanism through which astrocytic CN disrupts neurologic function associated with neurodegenerative disease.",Not available,URL not available

Adolescent stress accelerates postpartum novelty recognition impairment in 5xFAD mice.,"Pregnancy and the postpartum period induce physiological changes that can influence women's cognitive functions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a higher prevalence in women and is exacerbated by early life stress. In the present study, we found that late adolescent social isolation combined with the experience of pregnancy and delivery accelerates the onset of cognitive deficits in 5xFAD dams, particularly affecting their ability to recognize novelty. These cognitive deficits manifested as early as 16 weeks, earlier than the usual timeline for these mice, and were closely associated with increased levels of corticosterone, suggesting dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

Exploring the in vitro stability of insulin degrading enzyme as a potential biomarker for neurocognitive disorders and Alzheimer's disease risk.,"Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a critical role in degrading insulin and beta-forming proteins, implicating its significance as a biomarker in metabolic dysfunction and neurocognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the impact of pre-analytic conditions of in vitro IDE levels is imperative for reliable biomarker assessment. This study explored the influence of freeze-thaw cycles, storage temperature, and storage time on IDE levels in human serum. Serum samples from seven healthy volunteers were subjected to various storage conditions, including refrigeration (4 °C) and freezing (-20 °C and -80 °C) for 24 h and six months, with differing freeze-thaw cycles. In vitro IDE levels were measured at 24 h and after 6 months using ELISA. Results indicate that while short-term storage at either -20 °C or -80 °C yielded similar IDE levels, prolonged storage and multiple freeze-thaw cycles significantly impacted IDE stability, with colder temperatures exhibiting better preservation. Although further research with larger cohorts and longer storage time is warranted to establish clinical significance, our study suggests preferential use of unthawed samples or consistent freeze-thaw conditions for accurate IDE assessment. Thus, optimizing sample storage conditions is paramount for reliable IDE biomarker analysis in clinical and research settings.",PMC11134899,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11134899/
MicroRNAs in microglia: deciphering their role in neurodegenerative diseases.,"This review presents a comprehensive analysis of the role of microRNAs in microglia and their implications in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia, as the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are pivotal in maintaining neural homeostasis and responding to pathological changes. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of miRNAs, small non-coding RNA molecules, in regulating microglial functions. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS), dysregulated miRNA expression in microglia contributes to disease progression through various mechanisms such regulation of gene expression, as modulation of cytokine response and phagocytosis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how miRNAs influence microglial activation, cytokine production, and phagocytic activity. Specific miRNAs, such as miR-155, are explored for their roles in modulating microglial responses in the context of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The study also discusses the impact of miRNA dysregulation on the transition of microglia from a neuroprotective to a neurotoxic phenotype, a critical aspect in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",PMC11133688,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11133688/
Alcohol Use Disorder and Dementia: A Review.,"By 2040, 21.6% of Americans will be over age 65, and the population of those older than age 85 is estimated to reach 14.4 million. Although not causative, older age is a risk factor for dementia: every 5 years beyond age 65, the risk doubles; approximately one-third of those older than age 85 are diagnosed with dementia. As current alcohol consumption among older adults is significantly higher compared to previous generations, a pressing question is whether drinking alcohol increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia.",PMC11135165,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11135165/

The Role of Microglia with Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Its Therapeutic Prospects in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a primary cause of dementia, is rapidly emerging as one of the most financially taxing, lethal, and burdensome diseases of the 21st century. Increasing evidence suggests that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a key role in both the initiation and progression of AD. Recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction, particular in microglia where precedes neuroinflammation in AD. Multiple signaling pathways are implicated in this process and pharmaceutical interventions are potentially involved in AD treatment. In this review, advance over the last five years in the signaling pathways and pharmaceutical interventions are summarized and it is proposed that targeting the signaling pathways in microglia with mitochondrial dysfunction could represent a novel direction for AD treatment.",Not available,URL not available

[Experimental study on improvement of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease by different degrees of steaming and sunning of Polygoni Multiflori Radix based on fecal metabolomics].,"The fecal metabolomics method was employed to investigate the cognitive improvement mechanism of Polygoni Multiflori Radix in Alzheimer's disease(AD) and examine the effects of different degrees of steaming and sunning on cognitive function in AD model mice. Additionally, the processing principle of Polygoni Multiflori Radix was discussed. Forty-eight 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice were randomly assigned to the following groups: model group, positive group, raw product group, three-steaming and three-sunning product group, six-steaming and six-sunning product group, and nine-steaming and nine-sunning product group. Seven negative control mice from the same litter were included as the blank group. After 150 days of intragastric administration, the learning and memory abilities of mice in each group were assessed by using the Barnes maze and dark avoidance tests. Fecal samples were collected for extensive targeted metabolomics testing. Principal component analysis(PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA), and other multivariate statistical methods were utilized to analyze metabolites in mouse feces. Comparison of behavioral results between the model group and different product groups demonstrated that the six-steaming and six-sunning product group exhibited significantly reduced latency in the Barnes maze positioning and navigation test(P&lt;0.05), as well as a notable decrease in the number of errors in the space exploration experiment(P&lt;0.05). Moreover, the latency of mice entering the dark box for the first time in the dark avoidance experiment was significantly prolonged(P&lt;0.05), indicating the best overall improvement in the learning and memory ability of AD model mice. Metabolomics results revealed that compared with the model group, the differential metabolites in other groups in descending order were as follows: six-steaming and six-sunning product group &gt; nine-steaming and nine-sunning product group &gt; raw product group &gt; three-steaming and three-sunning product group, encompassing 146, 120, 95, and 81 potential biomarkers, respectively. Among them, 16 differential metabolites were related to AD disease. Further comparisons based on the degree of processing indicated that the six-steaming and six-sunning product group exhibited the most significant adjustments in total metabolic pathways, particularly regulating the interconversion of pentose and glucuronic acid, as well as amino acid anabolism and other pathways. In summary, the mechanism of Polygoni Multiflori Radix after processing in enhancing the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice may be associated with improved amino acid metabolism and increased energy metabolism in the body. The six-steaming and six-sunning yielded the best outcomes.",Not available,URL not available
[Effect of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction on TREM2/Akt/GSK3β pathway in cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice].,"The Chinese medical mechanism of Huanglian Jieduo Decoction on treating Alzheimer's disease(AD) characterized by &quot;toxin damaging brain collateral&quot; is still unclear. This study aims to explore the mechanism of Huanglian Jieduo Decoction on regulating triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2(TREM2)/protein kinase B(Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase 3β(GSK3β) pathway to improve the cognitive deficit in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. APP/PS1 mice of approximately nine months old were randomly divided into the model group, the low, medium, and high(2.5, 5, and 10 g·kg~(-1)) groups of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, and 0.75 mg·kg~(-1) donepezil hydrochloride group, and the C57BL/6J mice with the same age were taken as the normal group. After one month of continuous oral administration, a Morris water maze was performed to detect the learning and memory ability of mice. Hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining was applied to observe the morphology of neuronal cells in the cortical area of mice. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the protein expressions of β-amyloid(Aβ_(1-42)), CD86, and arginase 1(Arg1). The mRNA levels of interleukin(IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 in the cortex of mice were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR). The protein expressions of TREM2, phosphoinositide-3 kinase(PI3K), Akt, GSK3β, and beta-catenin(β-catenin) in mouse cortex were determined by Western blot. The results indicated that the escape latency of the model group was significantly prolonged, and the residence time in the target quadrant and the number of crossing the platform were significantly reduced compared with the normal group. Mice in the model group had a significantly lower number of neurons in the cortex and showed nuclear pyknosis and a significant increase in the expressions of Aβ_(1-42) and CD86. The mRNA levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in tissue were significantly increased, IL-10 were increased, while Arg1 were significantly decreased. The expression of TREM2, p-PI3K(Y607), p-Akt(T308), p-GSK3β(Ser9), and β-catenin in the cortex were significantly down-regulated. Compared with the model group, the escape latency of the mice in the administration group was significantly shortened, and the number of crossing the platform and the residence time in the target quadrant were significantly increased. Furthermore, the number of neurons in the cortex of mice was increased, and nuclear pyknosis was improved. Aβ_(1-42) deposition was decreased significantly. The mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and CD86 were significantly decreased, while IL-10 and Arg1 levels were significantly increased. The expression of TREM2, p-PI3K(Y607), p-Akt(T308), p-GSK3β(Ser9), and β-catenin protein in the cortex of each administration group was significantly up-regulated compared with the model group. In conclusion, Huanglian Jiedu Decoction reduced the expression of Aβ_(1-42) and neuroinflammation to a neuro-protective effect, thereby improving the learning and memory ability in APP/PS1 mice, which may be related to the TREM2/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway.",Not available,URL not available

Automated deep learning segmentation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease brain sections using a proprietary software.,"Neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) relies on semiquantitative analysis of phosphorylated tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs), without consideration of lesion heterogeneity in individual cases. We developed a deep learning workflow for automated annotation and segmentation of NPs and NFTs from AT8-immunostained whole slide images (WSIs) of AD brain sections. Fifteen WSIs of frontal cortex from 4 biobanks with varying tissue quality, staining intensity, and scanning formats were analyzed. We established an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven iterative procedure to improve the generation of expert-validated annotation datasets for NPs and NFTs thereby increasing annotation quality by >50%. This strategy yielded an expert-validated annotation database with 5013 NPs and 5143 NFTs. We next trained two U-Net convolutional neural networks for detection and segmentation of NPs or NFTs, achieving high accuracy and consistency (mean Dice similarity coefficient: NPs, 0.77; NFTs, 0.81). The workflow showed high generalization performance across different cases. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for the utilization of proprietary image analysis software (Visiopharm) in the automated deep learning segmentation of NPs and NFTs, demonstrating that AI can significantly improve the annotation quality of complex neuropathological features and enable the creation of highly precise models for identifying these markers in AD brain sections.",Not available,URL not available
Unraveling the complex role of MAPT-containing H1 and H2 haplotypes in neurodegenerative diseases.,"A ~ 1 Mb inversion polymorphism exists within the 17q21.31 locus of the human genome as direct (H1) and inverted (H2) haplotype clades. This inversion region demonstrates high linkage disequilibrium, but the frequency of each haplotype differs across ancestries. While the H1 haplotype exists in all populations and shows a normal pattern of genetic variability and recombination, the H2 haplotype is enriched in European ancestry populations, is less frequent in African ancestry populations, and nearly absent in East Asian ancestry populations. H1 is a known risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, and has been associated with many other traits, suggesting its importance in cellular phenotypes of the brain and entire body. Conversely, H2 is protective for these diseases, but is associated with predisposition to recurrent microdeletion syndromes and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Many single nucleotide variants and copy number variants define H1/H2 haplotypes and sub-haplotypes, but identifying the causal variant(s) for specific diseases and phenotypes is complex due to the extended linkage equilibrium. In this review, we assess the current knowledge of this inversion region regarding genomic structure, gene expression, cellular phenotypes, and disease association. We discuss recent discoveries and challenges, evaluate gaps in knowledge, and highlight the importance of understanding the effect of the 17q21.31 haplotypes to promote advances in precision medicine and drug discovery for several diseases.",PMC11138017,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11138017/

Association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level and cognitive impairment in older chronic kidney disease patients.,"This study aims to examine whether hypovitaminosis D was associated with cognitive impairment among chronic kidney patients with different level of albuminuria. This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on elderly (over 60 years old) with urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g from 2011 to 2014 in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Cognitive function was assessed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Learning (CERAD). Subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the absence or presence of cognitive impairment and a propensity score matching (PSM) was further conducted. The association was assessed with Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis. The positive association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and cognitive score was presented. PSM analysis revealed that a higher level of 25(OH)D3 correlated to a better cognitive function in CKD patients with albuminuria, especially in patients with 30 mg/g ≤ UACR < 300 mg/g. This study indicated that a low 25(OH)D3 level was associated with poor cognitive performance, especially in patients with microalbuminuria.

Cerebrovascular disease emerges with age and Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.,"Adults with Down syndrome have a genetic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and evidence of cerebrovascular disease across the AD continuum, despite few systemic vascular risk factors. The onset and progression of AD in Down syndrome is highly age-dependent, but it is unknown at what age cerebrovascular disease emerges and what factors influence its severity. In the Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome study (ABC-DS; n = 242; age = 25-72), we estimated the age inflection point at which MRI-based white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), microbleeds, and infarcts emerge in relation to demographic data, risk factors, amyloid and tau, and AD diagnosis. Enlarged PVS and infarcts appear to develop in the early 30s, while microbleeds, WMH, amyloid, and tau emerge in the mid to late 30s. Age-residualized WMH were higher in women, in individuals with dementia, and with lower body mass index. Participants with hypertension and APOE-ε4 had higher age-residualized PVS and microbleeds, respectively. Lifespan trajectories demonstrate a dramatic cerebrovascular profile in adults with Down syndrome that appears to evolve developmentally in parallel with AD pathophysiology approximately two decades prior to dementia symptoms.",PMC11137035,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137035/

Development of a novel non-invasive biomarker panel for hepatic fibrosis in MASLD.,"Accurate non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)-related fibrosis are urgently needed. This study applies a translational approach to develop a blood-based biomarker panel for fibrosis detection in MASLD. A molecular gene expression signature identified from a diet-induced MASLD mouse model (LDLr-/-.Leiden) is translated into human blood-based biomarkers based on liver biopsy transcriptomic profiles and protein levels in MASLD patient serum samples. The resulting biomarker panel consists of IGFBP7, SSc5D and Sema4D. LightGBM modeling using this panel demonstrates high accuracy in predicting MASLD fibrosis stage (F0/F1: AUC = 0.82; F2: AUC = 0.89; F3/F4: AUC = 0.87), which is replicated in an independent validation cohort. The overall accuracy of the model outperforms predictions by the existing markers Fib-4, APRI and FibroScan.
