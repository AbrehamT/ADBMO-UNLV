"Unveiling a novel memory center in human brain: neurochemical identification of the nucleus incertus, a key pontine locus implicated in stress and neuropathology.","The nucleus incertus (NI) was originally described by Streeter in 1903, as a midline region in the floor of the fourth ventricle of the human brain with an 'unknown' function. More than a century later, the neuroanatomy of the NI has been described in lower vertebrates, but not in humans. Therefore, we examined the neurochemical anatomy of the human NI using markers, including the neuropeptide, relaxin-3 (RLN3), and began to explore the distribution of the NI-related RLN3 innervation of the hippocampus.",6736046,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/6736046/

A multiomic atlas of the aging hippocampus reveals molecular changes in response to environmental enrichment.,"Aging involves the deterioration of organismal function, leading to the emergence of multiple pathologies. Environmental stimuli, including lifestyle, can influence the trajectory of this process and may be used as tools in the pursuit of healthy aging. To evaluate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in this context, we have generated bulk tissue and single cell multi-omic maps of the male mouse dorsal hippocampus in young and old animals exposed to environmental stimulation in the form of enriched environments. We present a molecular atlas of the aging process, highlighting two distinct axes, related to inflammation and to the dysregulation of mRNA metabolism, at the functional RNA and protein level. Additionally, we report the alteration of heterochromatin domains, including the loss of bivalent chromatin and the uncovering of a heterochromatin-switch phenomenon whereby constitutive heterochromatin loss is partially mitigated through gains in facultative heterochromatin. Notably, we observed the multi-omic reversal of a great number of aging-associated alterations in the context of environmental enrichment, which was particularly linked to glial and oligodendrocyte pathways. In conclusion, our work describes the epigenomic landscape of environmental stimulation in the context of aging and reveals how lifestyle intervention can lead to the multi-layered reversal of aging-associated decline.",9427998,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/9427998/

,"Over four decades of research support the link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and somatostatin (somatotropin-releasing inhibitory factor, SRIF). SRIF and SRIF-expressing neurons play an essential role in brain function, modulating hippocampal activity and memory formation. Loss of SRIF and SRIF-expressing neurons in the brain rests at the center of a series of interdependent pathological events driven by amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ), culminating in cognitive decline and dementia. The connection between the SRIF and AD further extends to the neuropsychiatric symptoms, seizure activity, and inflammation. Whereas, preclinical AD investigations show SRIF or SRIF-receptor agonist administration capable of enhancing cognition. SRIF receptor subtype-4 activation in particular presents unique attributes, with the potential to mitigate learning and memory decline, reduce comorbid symptoms, and enhance enzymatic degradation of Aβ in the brain. Here we review the links between SRIF and AD, along with the therapeutic implications. ",Not available,URL not available

Ensemble approach of transfer learning and vision transformer leveraging explainable AI for disease diagnosis: An advancement towards smart healthcare 5.0.,"Smart healthcare has advanced the medical industry with the integration of data-driven approaches. Artificial intelligence and machine learning provided remarkable progress, but there is a lack of transparency and interpretability in such applications. To overcome such limitations, explainable AI (EXAI) provided a promising result. This paper applied the EXAI for disease diagnosis in the advancement of smart healthcare. The paper combined the approach of transfer learning, vision transformer, and explainable AI and designed an ensemble approach for prediction of disease and its severity. The result is evaluated on a dataset of Alzheimer's disease. The result analysis compared the performance of transfer learning models with the ensemble model of transfer learning and vision transformer. For training, InceptionV3, VGG19, Resnet50, and Densenet121 transfer learning models were selected for ensembling with vision transformer. The result compares the performance of two models: a transfer learning (TL) model and an ensemble transfer learning (Ensemble TL) model combined with vision transformer (ViT) on ADNI dataset. For the TL model, the accuracy is 58 %, precision is 52 %, recall is 42 %, and the F1-score is 44 %. Whereas, the Ensemble TL model with ViT shows significantly improved performance i.e., 96 % of accuracy, 94 % of precision, 90 % of recall and 92 % of F1-score on ADNI dataset. This shows the efficacy of the ensemble model over transfer learning models.",Not available,URL not available
The interactive effects of different exercises and hawthorn consumption on the pain threshold of TMT-induced Alzheimer male rats.,"Exercise increases the pain threshold in healthy people. However, the pain threshold modulation effect of exercise and hawthorn is unclear because of its potential benefits in people with persistent pain, including those with Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, after the induction of Alzheimer's disease by trimethyl chloride, male rats with Alzheimer's disease were subjected to a 12-week training regimen consisting of resistance training, swimming endurance exercises, and combined exercises. In addition, hawthorn extract was orally administered to the rats. Then, their pain threshold was evaluated using three Tail-flick, Hot-plate, and Formalin tests. Our results showed that Alzheimer's decreased the pain threshold in all three behavioral tests. Combined exercise with hawthorn consumption had the most statistically significant effect on Alzheimer's male rats' pain threshold in all three experiments. A combination of swimming endurance and resistance exercises with hawthorn consumption may modulate hyperalgesia in Alzheimer's rats. Future studies need to determine the effects of these factors on the treatment and/or management of painful conditions.",8468241,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8468241/
Astaxanthin Rescues Memory Impairments in Rats with Vascular Dementia by Protecting Against Neuronal Death in the Hippocampus.,"Vascular dementia (VaD) is a cognitive disorder characterized by a decline in cognitive function resulting from cerebrovascular disease. The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to ischemic insults, leading to memory deficits in VaD. Astaxanthin (AST) has shown potential therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying its protective effects in VaD and against hippocampal neuronal death remain unclear. In this study, We used the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) method to establish a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rat model of VaD and administered a gastric infusion of AST at 25 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks to explore its therapeutic effects. Memory impairments were assessed using Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. We also performed biochemical analyses to evaluate levels of hippocampal neuronal death and apoptosis-related proteins, as well as the impact of astaxanthin on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that AST significantly rescued memory impairments in VaD rats. Furthermore, astaxanthin treatment protected against hippocampal neuronal death and attenuated apoptosis. We also observed that AST modulated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, suggesting its involvement in promoting neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, AST exhibited antioxidant properties, mitigating oxidative stress in the hippocampus. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic effects of AST in VaD. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying the actions of AST, this study highlights the importance of protecting hippocampal neurons and suggests potential targets for intervention in VaD. There are still some unanswered questions include long-term effects and optimal dosage of the use in human. Further research is warranted to fully understand the therapeutic potential of AST and its application in the clinical treatment of VaD.",8065559,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8065559/
Cellular and pathological functions of tau.,"Tau protein is involved in various cellular processes, including having a canonical role in binding and stabilization of microtubules in neurons. Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases marked by the abnormal accumulation of tau protein aggregates in neurons, as seen, for example, in conditions such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease. Mutations in tau coding regions or that disrupt tau mRNA splicing, tau post-translational modifications and cellular stress factors (such as oxidative stress and inflammation) increase the tendency of tau to aggregate and interfere with its clearance. Pathological tau is strongly implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and the propagation of tau aggregates is associated with disease severity. Recent technological advancements, including cryo-electron microscopy and disease models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, have increased our understanding of tau-related pathology in neurodegenerative conditions. Substantial progress has been made in deciphering tau aggregate structures and the molecular mechanisms that underlie protein aggregation and toxicity. In this Review, we discuss recent insights into the diverse cellular functions of tau and the pathology of tau inclusions and explore the potential for therapeutic interventions.",6763080,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/6763080/
Brain inflammation co-localizes highly with tau in mild cognitive impairment due to early-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"Brain inflammation, with an increased density of microglia and macrophages, is an important component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a potential therapeutic target. However, it is incompletely characterized, particularly in patients whose disease begins before the age of 65 years and, thus, have few co-pathologies. Inflammation has been usefully imaged with translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET), but most inflammation PET tracers cannot image subjects with a low-binder TSPO rs6971 genotype. In an important development, participants with any TSPO genotype can be imaged with a novel tracer, [11C]ER176, that has a high binding potential and a more favorable metabolite profile than other TSPO tracers currently available. We applied [11C]ER176 to detect brain inflammation in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) caused by early-onset AD. Furthermore, we sought to correlate the brain localization of inflammation, volume loss, elevated Aβ and tau. We studied brain inflammation in 25 patients with early-onset amnestic MCI (average age 59 ± 4.5 years, 10 women) and 23 healthy controls (average age 65 ± 6.0 years, 12 women), both groups with a similar proportion of all three TSPO-binding affinities. [11C]ER176 total distribution volume (VT), obtained with an arterial input function, was compared across patients and controls using voxel-wise and region-wise analyses. In addition to inflammation PET, most MCI patients had Aβ (n=23), and tau PET (n=21). For Aβ and tau tracers, standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated using cerebellar grey matter as region of reference. Regional correlations among the three tracers were determined. Data were corrected for partial volume effect. Cognitive performance was studied with standard neuropsychological tools. In MCI caused by early-onset AD, there was inflammation in the default network, reaching statistical significance in precuneus and lateral temporal and parietal association cortex bilaterally, and in the right amygdala. Topographically, inflammation co-localized most strongly with tau (r= 0.63 ± 0.24). This correlation was higher than the co-localization of Aβ with tau (r= 0.55±0.25) and of inflammation with Aβ (0.43±0.22). Inflammation co-localized least with atrophy (-0.29±0.26). These regional correlations could be detected in participants with any of the three rs6971 TSPO polymorphisms. Inflammation in AD-related regions correlated with impaired cognitive scores. Our data highlight the importance of inflammation, a potential therapeutic target, in the AD process. Furthermore, they support the notion that, as shown in experimental tissue and animal models, the propagation of tau in humans is associated with brain inflammation.",Not available,URL not available
Retinal imaging with hand-held optical coherence tomography in older people with or without postoperative delirium after hip fracture surgery: A feasibility study.,"Postoperative delirium in older people may result from the interaction between intrinsic brain vulnerability (e.g. neurodegeneration) and precipitating factors (e.g. surgery induced cytokines). Intrinsic brain vulnerability may be overt (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) or preclinical. In cognitively intact older people presenting for surgery, identification of preclinical neurodegeneration using bedside tools could aid postoperative delirium risk stratification. Thinning of the circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness is associated with neurodegenerative disorders e.g. Alzheimer's disease. We propose that thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer may be present some older people with postoperative delirium due to preclinical neurodegeneration, albeit to a lesser extent than in overt dementia.",Not available,URL not available

Rexinoids Induce Differential Gene Expression in Human Glioblastoma Cells and Protein-Protein Interactions in a Yeast Two-Hybrid System.,"Rexinoids are compounds that bind to the rexinoid X receptor (RXR) to modulate gene expression and have been proposed as a new class of therapeutics to treat Alzheimer's disease. Different rexinoids will initiate downstream effects that can be quite marked even though such compounds can be structurally similar and have comparable RXR binding affinities. RXR can both homo- and heterodimerize, and these protein-protein interactions and subsequent transactivating potential lead to differential gene expression, depending on the RXR dimeric partner, additional cofactors recruited, and downstream transcription factors that are up- or downregulated. Expression analysis was performed in the U87 human glioblastoma cell line treated with a panel of rexinoids, and our analysis demonstrated that rexinoids with similar RXR EC",Not available,URL not available

"Dysregulation of Lipid Metabolism Serves as A Link Between Alzheimer's and Cardiovascular Disease, As Witnessed in A Cross-Sectional Study.","Cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) increase the risk of suffering dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Here, we set out to define specific molecular profiles of CVD in patients with DAT to better understand its relationship, to unravel the mechanisms underlying the high risk of developing DAT in CVD patients and to define new markers of early disease. Plasma samples from patients with DAT, with and without CVD, were analyzed through a multiomics approach, with integration of metabolomics and proteomics datasets using the OmicsNet web-based tool. Metabolomics results showed an enrichment in lipids and lipid-like molecules. Similarly, the most significant cluster identified through proteomics was formed by 5 proteins related to lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism. After integration and functional enrichment, glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation and sphingolipid metabolism were among the most significant functions. Finally, differential expression of ABCA1 and APOH proteins was verified, in an independent cohort also including controls and patients with CVD alone. Both proteins positively correlated with phospho-Tau (181), a classical hallmark of DAT. Different molecular profiles exist in patients with DAT, with and without CVD, with exacerbated alterations in patients in which DAT and CVD co-exist. This information may help to define biomarkers like ABCA1 and APOH that identify patients with cardiovascular dysfunction that are at high risk of developing DAT. Such markers will allow more personalized interventions to be selected, a further step towards precision medicine for individuals whose molecular profiles indicate a distinct response to the same management strategies.",Not available,URL not available
APOE 5'UTR Methylation Pattern Analysis in Blood and Brain Tissue from Alzheimer's Disease Affected Patients.,"APOE ε4 allele is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Furthermore, APOE methylation pattern has been described to be associated with the disease and to follow a bimodal pattern, with a hypermethylated CpG island and a hypomethylated promoter region. However, little is known about the methylation levels in the APOE 5'UTR region. Here, the methylation of two regions (R1 and R2) within APOE 5'UTR was investigated in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and hippocampus (HIC) samples to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and to associate clinical, genetic features and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers levels. DNA was extracted from PBMCs of 20 AD and 20 healthy controls (HC) and from 6 AD and 3 HC HIC samples. The methylation analysis was carried out by means of pyrosequencing. In AD PBMCs we found that R1 region displayed a higher methylation level, while the opposite trend was observed in R2. The presence of ε4 allele highlighted a marked increase in R1 methylation level and a decrease in R2. In AD PBMCs and HIC, age progression resulted to be associated with an increase in the methylation level of R1. Lastly, the methylation of a CpG site in R2 was found to be related to CSF biomarkers. Despite the lack of a statistical significance, the outcome from this exploratory analysis highlighted the presence of a difference in methylation in APOE 5'UTR in PBMCs of AD patients which seemed to be associated also with APOE genotype, age and CSF biomarkers level.",Not available,URL not available

The Role of Gut Microbiota in the Neuroprotective Effects of Selenium in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The objective of the present review was to provide a timely update on the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of Se in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and discuss the potential role of gut microbiota modulation in this neuroprotective effect. The existing data demonstrate that selenoproteins P, M, S, R, as well as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases are involved in regulation of Aβ formation and aggregation, tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles formation, as well as mitigate the neurotoxic effects of Aβ and phospho-tau. Correspondingly, supplementation with various forms of Se in cellular and animal models of AD was shown to reduce Aβ formation, tau phosphorylation, reverse the decline in brain antioxidant levels, inhibit neuronal oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production, improve synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, altogether resulting in improved cognitive functions. In addition, most recent findings demonstrate that these neuroprotective effects are associated with Se-induced modulation of gut microbiota. In animal models of AD, Se supplementation was shown to improve gut microbiota biodiversity with a trend to increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Desulfivibrio, while reducing that of Lachnospiracea_NK4A136, Rikenella, and Helicobacter. Moreover, the relative abundance of Se-affected taxa was significantly associated with Aβ accumulation, tau phosphorylation, neuronal oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, indicative of the potential role of gut microbiota to mediate the neuroprotective effects of Se in AD. Hypothetically, modulation of gut microbiota along with Se supplementation may improve the efficiency of the latter in AD, although further detailed laboratory and clinical studies are required.",9370215,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/9370215/
Biflavonoid Methylchamaejasmin and Khaya grandifoliola Extract Inhibit NLRP3 Inflammasome in THP-1 Cell Model of Neuroinflammation.,"Neuroinflammation is a common hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with NLRP3 inflammasome proven to be activated in microglia of AD patients' brains. In this study, a newly isolated biflavonoid (7,7'-di-O-methylchamaejasmin/M8) and a crude extract of the plant Khaya grandifoliola (KG) were investigated for their inhibitory effect on inflammasome activation. In preliminary experiments, M8 and KG showed no cytotoxicity on human macrophage-like differentiated THP-1 cells and exhibited anti-inflammatory inhibition of nitric oxide produced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore, M8 and KG blocked IL-1β and IL-18 production by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome components including NFκB, NLRP3, Caspase-1, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18 at the mRNA and protein levels. Regarding the formation of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) specks during inflammasome activation, the size and fluorescent intensity of the existing specks were unchanged across all treatment conditions. However, M8 and KG treatments were shown to prevent further speck formation. In addition, experiments on amyloid β phagocytosis showed that M8 and KG pretreatments can restore the phagocytic activity of THP-1 cells, which was impaired following inflammasome activation. Altogether, our findings describe for the first time a promising role of biflavonoids and KG extract in preventing inflammasome activation and protecting against neuroinflammation, a key factor in AD development.",5952855,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/5952855/
An Expanded Narrative Review of Neurotransmitters on Alzheimer's Disease: The Role of Therapeutic Interventions on Neurotransmission.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles are the key players responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease. The accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau affect the balance in chemical neurotransmitters in the brain. Thus, the current review examined the role of neurotransmitters in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and discusses the alterations in the neurochemical activity and cross talk with their receptors and transporters. In the presence of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, changes may occur in the expression of neuronal receptors which in turn triggers excessive release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft contributing to cell death and neuronal damage. The GABAergic system may also be affected by AD pathology in a similar way. In addition, decreased receptors in the cholinergic system and dysfunction in the dopamine neurotransmission of AD pathology may also contribute to the damage to cognitive function. Moreover, the presence of deficiencies in noradrenergic neurons within the locus coeruleus in AD suggests that noradrenergic stimulation could be useful in addressing its pathophysiology. The regulation of melatonin, known for its effectiveness in enhancing cognitive function and preventing Aβ accumulation, along with the involvement of the serotonergic system and histaminergic system in cognition and memory, becomes remarkable for promoting neurotransmission in AD. Additionally, nitric oxide and adenosine-based therapeutic approaches play a protective role in AD by preventing neuroinflammation. Overall, neurotransmitter-based therapeutic strategies emerge as pivotal for addressing neurotransmitter homeostasis and neurotransmission in the context of AD. This review discussed the potential for neurotransmitter-based drugs to be effective in slowing and correcting the neurodegenerative processes in AD by targeting the neurochemical imbalance in the brain. Therefore, neurotransmitter-based drugs could serve as a future therapeutic strategy to tackle AD.",8354300,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8354300/

Spotlight on pro-inflammatory chemokines: regulators of cellular communication in cognitive impairment.,"Cognitive impairment is a decline in people's ability to think, learn, and remember, and so forth. Cognitive impairment is a global health challenge that affects the quality of life of thousands of people. The condition covers a wide range from mild cognitive impairment to severe dementia, which includes Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), among others. While the etiology of cognitive impairment is diverse, the role of chemokines is increasingly evident, especially in the presence of chronic inflammation and neuroinflammation. Although inflammatory chemokines have been linked to cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment is usually multifactorial. Researchers are exploring the role of chemokines and other inflammatory mediators in cognitive dysfunction and trying to develop therapeutic strategies to mitigate their effects. The pathogenesis of cognitive disorders is very complex, their underlying causative mechanisms have not been clarified, and their treatment is always one of the challenges in the field of medicine. Therefore, exploring its pathogenesis and treatment has important socioeconomic value. Chemokines are a growing family of structurally and functionally related small (8-10 kDa) proteins, and there is growing evidence that pro-inflammatory chemokines are associated with many neurobiological processes that may be relevant to neurological disorders beyond their classical chemotactic function and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of cognitive disorders. In this paper, we review the roles and regulatory mechanisms of pro-inflammatory chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL20, and CXCL8) in cognitive impairment. We also discuss the intrinsic relationship between the two, hoping to provide some valuable references for the treatment of cognitive impairment.",PMC11247373,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11247373/

Are the promnestic effects of neurokinin 3 receptor mediated by hippocampal neurogenesis in a Aβ-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterised by cognitive dysfunction, memory loss and mood changes. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been suggested to play a role in learning and memory. Neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) has been shown to be prevalent in the hippocampus region. The aim of the project was to investigate the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in the promnestic effects of NK3R agonist administration in an amyloid beta-induced AD rat model. Wistar albino rats were divided into control, Alzheimer, NK3R agonist and Alzheimer + NK3R agonist groups. The open field (OF) test and Morris water maze (MWM) test were performed for locomotor activity and memory analysis. Peptide gene expression levels (Nestin, DCX, Neuritin, MASH1, Neun, BDNF) were analysed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the OF test, the group-time relationship was found to be statistically different in the parameters of distance travelled and percentage of movement (p < 0.05). In MWM, the time to reach the platform and the time spent in the target quadrant were statistically significant between the groups (p < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were observed in gene expression levels (Nestin, DCX, Neuritin, MASH1) in the hippocampal tissue of rats between the groups (p < 0.05). NK3 receptor agonism favourably affected hippocampal neurogenesis in AD model rats. It was concluded that NK3 receptor agonism in the hippocampus, which is the first affected region in the physiopathology of AD, may be effective in both the formation of neural precursor cells and the reduction of neuronal degeneration. The positive effect of NK3R on cognitive functions may be mediated by hippocampal neurogenesis.",Not available,URL not available
A Peculiar Tau Accumulation Pattern Identified Via 18F-Florzolotau PET Imaging in a Patient With Frontotemporal Dementia Caused by a Mutation in the MAPT Gene.,"We reported imaging findings with a peculiar tau accumulation pattern in a 56 year-old woman with frontotemporal dementia caused by Q351R mutation in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene. She had a 10-year history of gradually worsening memory loss. 18F-FDG PET demonstrated hypometabolism in medial temporal lobes, but 18F-florbetapir PET manifested no abnormal amyloid beta deposition, which ruled out Alzheimer disease. 18F-florzolotau PET showed tau proteins accumulated in medial temporal lobes, basal ganglia brainstem, and cerebellum. The pattern is different from other known MAPT gene mutation. Multitracer imaging can help differentiate between Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia caused by MAPT mutation.",Not available,URL not available

Psychological distress among family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in Uganda.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present growing global health challenges, especially in aging populations, such as Uganda. In Uganda, familial caregiving, predominantly undertaken by female relatives, is the primary form of support provided to patients with ADRD. Cultural stigma around dementia and limited access to support services amplify caregivers' challenges.

Truncated tau interferes with the autophagy and endolysosomal pathway and results in lipid accumulation.,"The autophagy-lysosomal pathway plays a critical role in the clearance of tau protein aggregates that deposit in the brain in tauopathies, and defects in this system are associated with disease pathogenesis. Here, we report that expression of Tau35, a tauopathy-associated carboxy-terminal fragment of tau, leads to lipid accumulation in cell lines and primary cortical neurons. Our findings suggest that this is likely due to a deleterious block of autophagic clearance and lysosomal degradative capacity by Tau35. Notably, upon induction of autophagy by Torin 1, Tau35 inhibited nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a key regulator of lysosomal biogenesis. Both cell lines and primary cortical neurons expressing Tau35 also exhibited changes in endosomal protein expression. These findings implicate autophagic and endolysosomal dysfunction as key pathological mechanisms through which disease-associated tau fragments could lead to the development and progression of tauopathy.",5390006,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/5390006/

Network Pharmacology Reveals Key Targets and Pathways of Madhuca longifolia for Potential Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.,"Madhuca longifolia, commonly known as the mahua tree, has been traditionally used in medicine due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and antimicrobial properties. Its active compounds help in managing diabetes, alleviating cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, the exact neuroprotective mechanism of Madhuca longifolia against Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. This study looked into possible methods by which Madhuca longifolia protects against Alzheimer's disease using network pharmacology, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations studies. By applying pre-screening of active constituents, target prediction, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, our study found that Madhuca longifolia is related to eight active ingredients (Ascorbic acid, Riboflavin, Pantothenic acid, (4 R)-2beta,3beta,23-trihydroxy-oleana-5,12-dien-28-oic acid, Quercetin, Nicotinic acid, Bassiaic acid Thiamine) and 272 common gene targets, with significant involvement in pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Network analysis demonstrated how Madhuca longifolia can prevent AD by modifying important signalling networks, which may be one of the molecular mechanisms driving the plant's effectiveness against the disease. Molecular docking studies revealed that there were robust binding abilities of Quercetin, Riboflavin and Pantothenic acid to key target proteins AKT1, JUN, and STAT3. Later, molecular dynamic simulations was done to examine the successful activity of the active compounds against potential targets, and it was found that AKT1 and AKT1-Quercetin complex became stable at 260 ps. It may be seen through the study that quercetin may act as a good inhibitor for treatment. This thorough investigation provides a strong basis for future research and development efforts by advancing our understanding of Madhuca longifolia medicinal potential in Alzheimer's disease.",9220886,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/9220886/
Synthesis and Neurobehavioral Evaluation of a Potent Multitargeted Inhibitor for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant health challenge worldwide, affecting millions of individuals, and projected to increase further as the global population ages. Current pharmacological interventions primarily target acetylcholine deficiency and amyloid plaque formation, but offer limited efficacy and are often associated with adverse effects. Given the multifactorial nature of AD, there is a critical need for novel therapeutic approaches that simultaneously target multiple pathological pathways. Targeting key enzymes involved in AD pathophysiology, such as acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and gamma-secretase, is a potential strategy to mitigate disease progression. To this end, our research group has conducted comprehensive in silico screening to identify some lead compounds, including IQ6 (SSZ), capable of simultaneously inhibiting the enzymes mentioned above. Building upon this foundation, we synthesized SSZ, a novel multitargeted ligand/inhibitor to address various pathological mechanisms underlying AD. Chemically, SSZ exhibits pharmacological properties conducive to AD treatment, featuring pyrrolopyridine and N-cyclohexyl groups. Preclinical experimental evaluation of SSZ in AD rat model showed promising results, with notable improvements in behavioral and cognitive parameters. Specifically, SSZ treatment enhanced locomotor activity, ameliorated gait abnormalities, and improved cognitive function compared to untreated AD rats. Furthermore, brain morphological analysis demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of SSZ, attenuating Aβ-induced neuronal damage and preserving brain morphology. Combined treatment of SSZ and conventional drugs (DON and MEM) showed synergistic effects, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for AD management. Overall, our study highlights the efficacy of multitargeted ligands like SSZ in combating AD by addressing the complex etiology of the disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the full therapeutic potential of SSZ and the exploration of similar compounds in clinical settings, offering hope for an effective AD treatment in the future.",6489761,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/6489761/
Mitochondrial DNA abundance in blood is associated with Alzheimer's disease- and dementia-risk.,"The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been portrayed through molecular, cellular, and animal studies; however large epidemiological studies are lacking. This study aimed to explore the association of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), a marker representative of mtDNA abundance per cell, with risk of incident all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia diagnosis within 17 years and dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL). Additionally, sex-stratified analyses were completed. In this German population-based cohort study (ESTHER), 9940 participants aged 50-75 years were enrolled by general practitioners and followed for 17 years. Participants were included in this study if information on dementia status and blood-based mtDNAcn measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction were available. In a nested case-control approach, a subsample of participants additionally had measurements of P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL in blood samples taken at baseline. Of 4913 participants eligible for analyses, 386 were diagnosed with incident all-cause dementia, including 130 AD and 143 vascular dementia cases, while 4527 participants remained without dementia diagnosis within 17 years. Participants with low mtDNAcn (lowest 10%) experienced 45% and 65% percent increased risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD after adjusting for age and sex (all-cause dementia: HRadj, 95%CI:1.45, 1.08-1.94; AD: HRadj, 95%CI: 1.65, 1.01-2.68). MtDNAcn was not associated to vascular dementia diagnosis and was more strongly associated with all-cause dementia among women. In the nested case-control study (n = 790), mtDNAcn was not significantly associated with the dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) levels in blood from baseline before dementia diagnosis. This study provides novel epidemiological evidence connecting mtDNA abundance, measured via mtDNAcn, to incident dementia and AD at the population-based level. Reduced mitochondrial abundance may play a role in pathogenesis, especially among women.",7392084,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/7392084/
The autophagy adaptor TRIAD3A promotes tau fibrillation by nested phase separation.,"Multiple neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by aberrant proteinaceous accumulations of tau. Here, we report a RING-in-between-RING-type E3 ligase, TRIAD3A, that functions as an autophagy adaptor for tau. TRIAD3A(RNF216) is an essential gene with mutations causing age-progressive neurodegeneration. Our studies reveal that TRIAD3A E3 ligase catalyses mixed K11/K63 polyubiquitin chains and self-assembles into liquid-liquid phase separated (LLPS) droplets. Tau is ubiquitinated and accumulates within TRIAD3A LLPS droplets and, via LC3 interacting regions, targets tau for autophagic degradation. Unexpectedly, tau sequestered within TRIAD3A droplets rapidly converts to fibrillar aggregates without the transitional liquid phase of tau. In vivo studies show that TRIAD3A decreases the accumulation of phosphorylated tau in a tauopathy mouse model, and a disease-associated mutation of TRIAD3A increases accumulation of phosphorylated tau, exacerbates gliosis and increases pathological tau spreading. In human Alzheimer disease brain, TRIAD3A co-localizes with tau amyloid in multiple histological forms, suggesting a role in tau proteostasis. TRIAD3A is an autophagic adaptor that utilizes E3 ligase and LLPS as a mechanism to capture cargo and appears especially relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.",8041349,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8041349/

c-KIT inhibitors reduce pathology and improve behavior in the Tg(SwDI) model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Treatments for Alzheimer's disease have primarily focused on removing brain amyloid plaques to improve cognitive outcomes in patients. We developed small compounds, known as BK40143 and BK40197, and we hypothesize that these drugs alleviate microglial-mediated neuroinflammation and induce autophagic clearance of neurotoxic proteins to improve behavior in models of neurodegeneration. Specificity binding assays of BK40143 and BK40197 showed primary binding to c-KIT/Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptors (PDGFR)α/β, whereas BK40197 also differentially binds to FYVE finger-containing phosphoinositide kinase (PIKFYVE). Both compounds penetrate the CNS, and treatment with these drugs inhibited the maturation of peripheral mast cells in transgenic mice, correlating with cognitive improvements on measures of memory and anxiety. In the brain, microglial activation was profoundly attenuated and amyloid-beta and tau were reduced via autophagy. Multi-kinase inhibition, including c-KIT, exerts multifunctional effects to reduce neurodegenerative pathology via autophagy and microglial activity and may represent a potential therapeutic option for neurodegeneration.",Not available,URL not available

Human fibroblasts from sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) show mitochondrial alterations and lysosome dysfunction.,"Mitophagy is a mechanism that maintains mitochondrial integrity and homeostasis and is thought to promote longevity and reduce the risk of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate the abundance of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial function, and mitophagy in primary fibroblasts from patients with sporadic AD (sAD) and normal healthy controls. The results show increased levels of mitochondrial ROS, changes in mitochondrial morphology, altered bioenergetic properties, and defects in autophagy, mitophagy, and lysosome-mediated degradation pathways in sAD fibroblasts relative to control fibroblasts. Interestingly, lysosome abundance and the staining of lysosomal markers remained high, while the capacity of lysosome-dependent degradation was lower in sAD fibroblasts than in controls fibroblasts. Nicotinamide riboside supplementation decreased mitochondrial ROS, while capacity for lysosomal degradation remained unchanged in sAD fibroblasts relative to healthy control fibroblasts. These findings provide insight into molecular mechanisms involving the dysregulation of lysosome and autophagy/mitophagy pathways that may contribute significantly to clinical signs and pathological features of sAD.",Not available,URL not available

Magnesium and Cognitive Health in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Magnesium (Mg) plays a key role in neurological functioning and manifestations. However, the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohorts on Mg and cognitive health among adults has not been systematically reviewed. We aimed to examine the associations of various Mg forms (supplements, dietary intake, and biomarkers) with cognitive outcomes by summarizing evidence from RCTs and cohorts. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant peer-reviewed articles published up to May 3, 2024. Three random-effects models were performed, when appropriate, to evaluate the relationship between Mg and cognitive outcomes: 1) linear meta-regression, 2) non-linear (quadratic) meta-regression, and 3) meta-analysis using Mg variables categorized based on pre-existing recommendations. Three RCTs and 12 cohort studies were included in this systematic review. Evidence from the limited numbers of RCTs was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of Mg supplements. Cohort studies showed inconsistent dose-response relationships between dietary Mg and cognitive disorders, with high heterogeneity across populations. However, consistent U-shape associations of serum Mg with all-cause dementia and cognitive impairment were found in cohorts, suggesting an optimal serum Mg concentration around 0.85 mmol/L. This non-linear association was detected in meta-regression (P",Not available,URL not available
Early spatial recognition memory deficits in 5XFAD female mice are associated with disruption of prefrontal parvalbumin neurons.,"Women have a two-fold increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, yet the underlying mechanisms of this sex-specific vulnerability remain unknown. Here, we aimed at determining in the 5XFAD mouse model whether deficits in prefrontal-dependent cognitive functions, which are impacted in the preclinical stages of AD, appear earlier in females, and whether these cognitive deficits are associated with alterations in the activity of prefrontal parvalbumin (PV)-neurons that regulate prefrontal circuits activity. We observed that 3.5-month-old 5XFAD females, but not males, display impairments in spatial short-term recognition memory, a function that relies on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions were intact in both sexes. We then observed that 5XFAD females have more prefrontal PV neurons expressing the marker of chronic activity FosB; this was inversely correlated with prefrontal-dependent cognitive performances. Our findings show for the first time sex-specific, early deregulation of prefrontal PV neurons activity, which is associated with early appearance of prefrontal-dependent cognitive functions in 5XFAD females providing a potential novel mechanism to the increased risk to AD in females.",Not available,URL not available
Comparative performance of five cognitive screening tests in a large sample of seniors.,"Introduction Recent introductions of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease have re-invigorated the cause of early dementia detection. Cognitive ""Paper &amp;amp; pencil"" tests represent the bedrock of clinical assessment, because they are cheap, easy to perform, and don't require brain imaging or biological testing. Cognitive tests vary greatly in duration, complexity, sociolinguistic biases, probed cognitive domains, and their specificity and sensitivity of detecting cognitive impairment (CI). Consequently, an ecologically valid head-to-head comparison seems essential for evidence-based dementia screening. Method We compared five tests: MoCA, ADAS, ACE-III, Eurotest, and Phototest on a large sample of seniors (N=456, 77.9 ± 8 years, 71% females). Their specificity and sensitivity was estimated in a novel way by contrasting each test's outcome to the majority outcome across the remaining tests (Comparative Specificity &amp;amp; Sensitivity Calculation - CSSC). This obviates the need for an a priori gold standard such as a clinically clear-cut sample of dementia/MCI/controls. We posit that the CSSC results in a more ecologically valid estimation of clinical performance while precluding biases resulting from different dementia/MCI diagnostic criteria, and the proficiency of detecting these conditions. Results There exists a stark trade-off between behavioral test specificity and sensitivity. The test with the highest specificity had the lowest sensitivity, and vice versa. The comparative specificities and sensitivities were, respectively: Phototest (97%, 47%), Eurotest (94%, 55%), ADAS (90%, 68%), ACE-III (72%, 77%), MoCA (55%, 95%). Conclusion Assuming a CI prevalence of 10%, the shortest (~3 min) and the simplest instrument - the Phototest, was shown to have the best overall performance (accuracy 92%, PPV 66%, NPV 94%).",Not available,URL not available

"Systemic inflammatory markers in ageing, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.","Systemic inflammation with alterations in inflammatory markers is involved in aging and Alzheimer's disease. However, few studies have investigated the longitudinal trajectories of systemic inflammatory markers during aging and Alzheimer's disease, and specific markers contributing to Alzheimer's disease remain undetermined. In this study, a longitudinal cohort (cohort 1: n = 290; controls, 136; preclinical Alzheimer's disease, 154) and a cross-sectional cohort (cohort 2: n = 351; controls, 62; Alzheimer's disease, 63; vascular dementia, 58; Parkinson's disease dementia, 56; behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 57; dementia with Lewy bodies, 55) were included. Plasma levels of inflammatory markers were measured every 2 years during a 10-year follow-up in the longitudinal cohort and once in the cross-sectional cohort. The study demonstrated that the inflammatory markers significantly altered during both aging and the development of Alzheimer's disease. However, only complement C3, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 exhibited significant changes in participants with preclinical Alzheimer's disease, and their longitudinal changes were significantly associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease compared to controls over the 10-year follow-up. In the cross-sectional cohort, complement C3 demonstrates specificity to Alzheimer's disease, while interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 were also altered in other dementias. The study provides a new perspective on the involvement of inflammatory markers in the aging process and the development of Alzheimer's disease, implying that regulating inflammation may have a pivotal role in promoting successful aging and in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Not available,URL not available
Implications of microbe-derived ɣ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in gut and brain barrier integrity and GABAergic signaling in Alzheimer's disease.,"The gut microbial ecosystem communicates bidirectionally with the brain in what is known as the gut-microbiome-brain axis. Bidirectional signaling occurs through several pathways including signaling via the vagus nerve, circulation of microbial metabolites, and immune activation. Alterations in the gut microbiota are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Perturbations in gut microbial communities may affect pathways within the gut-microbiome-brain axis through altered production of microbial metabolites including ɣ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory mammalian neurotransmitter. GABA has been shown to act on gut integrity through modulation of gut mucins and tight junction proteins and may be involved in vagus nerve signal inhibition. The GABAergic signaling pathway has been shown to be dysregulated in AD, and may be responsive to interventions. Gut microbial production of GABA is of recent interest in neurological disorders, including AD. ",Not available,URL not available

DAP12 interacts with RER1 and is retained in the secretory pathway before assembly with TREM2.,"DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) is a transmembrane adapter protein expressed in lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells. It interacts with several immunoreceptors forming functional complexes that trigger intracellular signaling pathways. One of the DAP12 associated receptors is the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). Mutations in both DAP12 and TREM2 have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, mechanisms involved in the regulation of subcellular trafficking and turnover of these proteins are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that proteasomal degradation of DAP12 is increased in the absence of TREM2. Interestingly, unassembled DAP12 is also retained in early secretory compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), thereby preventing its transport to the plasma membrane. We also show that unassembled DAP12 interacts with the retention in ER sorting receptor 1 (RER1). The deletion of endogenous RER1 decreases expression of functional TREM2-DAP12 complexes and membrane proximal signaling, and resulted in almost complete inhibition of phagocytic activity in THP-1 differentiated macrophage-like cells. These results indicate that RER1 acts as an important regulator of DAP12 containing immunoreceptor complexes and immune cell function.",151875,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/151875/
"Engram Studies: A Call for Historical, Philosophical, and Sociological Approaches.","In this chapter, we identify three distinct avenues of research on the philosophical, historical, and sociopolitical dimensions of engram research. First, we single out the need to refine philosophical understandings of memory within neuroscientific research on the engram. Specifically, we question the place of constructivist and preservationist philosophical claims on memory in the formulation of the engram concept and its operationalization in contemporary neuroscience research. Second, we delve into the received historiography of the engram claiming its disappearance after Richard Semon's (1859-1918) coinage of the concept. Differently from this view, we underline that Semon's legacy is still largely undocumented: Unknown are the ways the engram circulated within studies of organic memory as well as the role Semon's ideas had in specific national contexts of research in neurosciences. Finally, another research gap on the engram concerns a socio-anthropological documentation of the factual and normative resources this research offers to think about memory in healthcare and society. Representations of memory in this research, experimental strategies of intervention into the engram, as well as their translational potential for neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and psychiatric (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) conditions have not yet received scrutiny notwithstanding their obvious social and political relevance.All these knowledge gaps combined call for a strong commitment towards interdisciplinarity to align the ambitions of a foundational neuroscience of the engram with a socially responsible circulation of this knowledge. What role can the facts, metaphors, and interventional strategies of engram research play in the wider society? With what implications for philosophical questions at the foundation of memory, which have accompanied its study from antiquity?

Prediction of the 3D conformation of a small peptide vaccine targeting Aβ42 oligomers.,"The original etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins, which starts from the aggregation of the Aβ oligomers. The optimal therapeutic strategy targeting Aβ oligomer aggregation is the development of AD vaccines. Despite the fact that positive progress has been made for experimental attempts at AD vaccines, the physicochemical and even structural properties of these AD vaccines remain unclear. In this study, through immunoinformatic and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we first designed and simulated an alternative of vaccine TAPAS and found that the structure of the alternative can reproduce the 3D conformation of TAPAS determined experimentally. Meanwhile, immunoinformatic methods were used to analyze the physicochemical properties of TAPAS, including immunogenicity, antigenicity, thermal stability, and solubility, which confirm well the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, and validate the scheme reliability of immunoinformatic and MD simulations in designing and simulating the TAPAS vaccine.

Rapid Microbial Profiling through Multimodal Biosensors for Transversal Analysis.,"The intricate interactions between host and microbial communities hold significant implications for biology and medicine. However, traditional microbial profiling methods face limitations in processing time, measurement of absolute abundance, detection of low biomass, discrimination between live and dead cells, and functional analysis. This study introduces a rapid multimodal microbial characterization platform, Multimodal Biosensors for Transversal Analysis (MBioTA), for capturing the taxonomy, viability, and functional genes of the microbiota. The platform incorporates single cell biosensors, scalable microwell arrays, and automated image processing for rapid transversal analysis in as few as 2 h. The multimodal biosensors simultaneously characterize the taxon, viability, and functional gene expression of individual cells. By automating the image processing workflow, the single cell analysis techniques enable the quantification of bacteria with sensitivity down to 0.0075%, showcasing its capability in detecting low biomass samples. We illustrate the applicability of the MBioTA platform through the transversal analysis of the gut microbiota composition, viability, and functionality in a familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model.

Specifically, we anchor subjects relative to the time of disease diagnosis (anchoring time) as in a revival process, and we estimate networks at each time point of interest relative to the anchoring time. To use all available data, we apply kernel weights to borrow information across observations that are close to the time of interest. Adaptive lasso weights are introduced to encourage temporal smoothness in edge strength, while a novel elastic fused- ",Not available,URL not available
Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of Benfotiamine in a Sporadic Alzheimer's-Like Disease Rat Model: Insights into Insulin Signaling and Cognitive function.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative process, also considered a metabolic condition due to alterations in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathways in the brain, which share similarities with diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of benfotiamine (BFT), a vitamin B1 analog, in the early stages of the neurodegenerative process in a sporadic model of Alzheimer's-like disease induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Supplementation with 150 mg/kg of BFT for 7 days reversed the cognitive impairment in short- and long-term memories caused by STZ in rodents. We attribute these effects to BFT's ability to modulate glucose transporters type 1 and 3 (GLUT1 and GLUT3) in the hippocampus, inhibit GSK3 activity in the hippocampus, and modulate the insulin signaling in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, as well as reduce the activation of apoptotic pathways (BAX) in the hippocampus. Therefore, BFT emerges as a promising and accessible intervention in the initial treatment of conditions similar to AD.",Not available,URL not available
Systemic Administration of Neurotransmitter-Derived Lipidoids-PROTACs-DNA Nanocomplex Promotes Tau Clearance and Cognitive Recovery for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant burden on the economy and healthcare systems worldwide. Although the pathophysiology of AD remains debatable, its progression is strongly correlated with the accumulation of tau aggregates. Therefore, tau clearance from brain lesions can be a promising strategy for AD therapy. To achieve this, the present study combined proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), a novel protein-degradation technique that mediates degradation of target proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and a neurotransmitter-derived lipidoid (NT-lipidoid) nanoparticle delivery system with high blood-brain barrier-penetration activity, to generate a novel nanomedicine named NPD. Peptide 1, a cationic tau-targeting PROTAC is loaded onto the positively charged nanoparticles using DNA-intercalation technology. The resulting nanomedicine displayed good encapsulation efficiency, serum stability, drug release profile, and blood-brain barrier-penetration capability. Furthermore, NPD potently induced tau clearance in both cultured neuronal cells and the brains of AD mice. Moreover, intravenous injection of NPD led to a significant improvement in the cognitive function of the AD mice, without any remarkable abnormalities, thereby supporting its clinical development. Collectively, the novel nanomedicine developed in this study may serve as an innovative strategy for AD therapy, since it effectively and specifically induces tau protein clearance in brain lesions, which in turn enhances cognition.",Not available,URL not available

Enhancing socio-communicative functions in an MCI patient with intra-nasal insulin: a case report.,"This report examines extended intra-nasal insulin treatment [INI] for an Insulin Resistant early Mild Cognitive Impairment [MCI] patient. Patient [EJ] also had medial temporal lobe [MTL] damage, poor short-term memory, significant irritability, and social and linguistic withdrawal at treatment start. Compared to baseline, nine months INI treatment increased grey matter volume, lowered beta-amyloid levels, and improved MCI and FAS scores. Patient also increased pragmatic capacities in social conversation and procedural memory. These findings align with results from prior clinical trials on INI and suggest that treatment can slow neurodegenerative disease progression in early MCI patients.",PMC11239438,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11239438/

Cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases: an emerging research frontier.,"The cerebellum is crucial for both motor and nonmotor functions. Alzheimer's disease (AD), alongside other dementias such as vascular dementia (VaD), Lewy body dementia (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as other neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA), are characterized by specific and non-specific neurodegenerations in central nervous system. Previously, the cerebellum's significance in these conditions was underestimated. However, advancing research has elevated its profile as a critical node in disease pathology. We comprehensively review the existing evidence to elucidate the relationship between cerebellum and the aforementioned diseases. Our findings reveal a growing body of research unequivocally establishing a link between the cerebellum and AD, other forms of dementia, and other NDs, supported by clinical evidence, pathological and biochemical profiles, structural and functional neuroimaging data, and electrophysiological findings. By contrasting cerebellar observations with those from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, we highlight the cerebellum's distinct role in the disease processes. Furthermore, we also explore the emerging therapeutic potential of targeting cerebellum for the treatment of these diseases. This review underscores the importance of the cerebellum in these diseases, offering new insights into the disease mechanisms and novel therapeutic strategies.",PMC11245631,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11245631/
Neuroinflammation: A Critical Factor in Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"This review offers a comprehensive review of the signals and the paramount role neuroinflammation plays in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study explores the sophisticated interactions between microglial, astrocytic, and dendritic cells and how neuroinflammation affects long-term neuronal damage and dysfunction. There are specific pathways related to the mentioned inflammatory processes, including Janus kinases/signal transducer and activator of transcriptions, nuclear factor-κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways. Neuroinflammation is argued to be a double-edged sword, being not only a protective agent that prevents further neuron damage but also the causative factor in more cell injury development. This concept of contrasting inflammation with neuroprotection advocates for the use of therapeutic techniques that seek to modulate neuroinflammatory responses as part of the neurodegeneration treatment. The recent research findings are integrated with the established knowledge to help present a comprehensive image of neuroinflammation's impact on neurodegenerative diseases and its implications for future therapy.",PMC11246070,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11246070/

Contrastive Self-supervised Learning for Neurodegenerative Disorder Classification.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) involve specific loss of brain volume, detectable in vivo using T1-weighted MRI scans. Supervised machine learning approaches classifying neurodegenerative diseases require diagnostic-labels for each sample. However, it can be difficult to obtain expert labels for a large amount of data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an alternative for training machine learning models without data-labels. We investigated if the SSL models can applied to distinguish between different neurodegenerative disorders in an interpretable manner. Our method comprises a feature extractor and a downstream classification head. A deep convolutional neural network trained in a contrastive self-supervised way serves as the feature extractor, learning latent representation, while the classifier head is a single-layer perceptron. We used N=2694 T1-weighted MRI scans from four data cohorts: two ADNI datasets, AIBL and FTLDNI, including cognitively normal controls (CN), cases with prodromal and clinical AD, as well as FTLD cases differentiated into its sub-types. Our results showed that the feature extractor trained in a self-supervised way provides generalizable and robust representations for the downstream classification. For AD vs. CN, our model achieves 82% balanced accuracy on the test subset and 80% on an independent holdout dataset. Similarly, the Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (BV) vs. CN model attains an 88% balanced accuracy on the test subset. The average feature attribution heatmaps obtained by the Integrated Gradient method highlighted hallmark regions, i.e., temporal gray matter atrophy for AD, and insular atrophy for BV. In conclusion, our models perform comparably to state-of-the-art supervised deep learning approaches. This suggests that the SSL methodology can successfully make use of unannotated neuroimaging datasets as training data while remaining robust and interpretable.",PMC11245060,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11245060/
A Comprehensive Head-to-Head Comparison of Key Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 Biomarker Tests.,"Plasma phosphorylated-tau 217 (p-tau217) is currently the most promising biomarkers for reliable detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.

"Gradient synchronization for multivariate functional data, with application to brain connectivity.","Quantifying the association between components of multivariate random curves is of general interest and is a ubiquitous and basic problem that can be addressed with functional data analysis. An important application is the problem of assessing functional connectivity based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where one aims to determine the similarity of fMRI time courses that are recorded on anatomically separated brain regions. In the functional brain connectivity literature, the static temporal Pearson correlation has been the prevailing measure for functional connectivity. However, recent research has revealed temporally changing patterns of functional connectivity, leading to the study of dynamic functional connectivity. This motivates new similarity measures for pairs of random curves that reflect the dynamic features of functional similarity. Specifically, we introduce gradient synchronization measures in a general setting. These similarity measures are based on the concordance and discordance of the gradients between paired smooth random functions. Asymptotic normality of the proposed estimates is obtained under regularity conditions. We illustrate the proposed synchronization measures via simulations and an application to resting-state fMRI signals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and they are found to improve discrimination between subjects with different disease status.",PMC11239314,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11239314/
Association of Klotho with Neuropsychiatric Disorder: A Meta-Analysis.,"Neuropsychiatric disorders are mainly concerned with the behavioural, emotional and cognition symptoms that may be due to disturbed cerebral functions or extracerebral disease. Klotho protein is an antiaging protein that is mostly associated with cognitive changes in these disorders and thus this meta-analysis is conducted in order to find Klotho proteins association with these disorders. We searched related topics in pubmed, by using the key word i.e. Klotho and related disorder from neuropsychiatry e.g. Klotho levels and schizophrenia, Klotho levels and parkinsonism etc. Total 82 studies were found till 9th February 2021 after extensive search and 10 studies were selected for further analysis. The meta-analysis of studies was performed using the Random effect model. The forest plot represented each study in the meta-analysis, so as to make the comparison of SMD value across studies. The meta-analysis outcome demonstrated that overall schizophrenia had higher klotho levels as compared with bipolar disorder, psychosocial stress, parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy controls, followed by MS. The meta-analysis also found that bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease were associated with low klotho levels as compared to schizophrenia. The results indicate a significant association of the klotho levels and schizophrenia. Further studies are needed to characterize the potential biological roles of klotho levels in psychiatric disorders.",PMC11239616,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11239616/
Non-coding RNAs involved in the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia globally, having a pathophysiology that is complex and multifactorial. Recent findings highlight the significant role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), specifically microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. These ncRNAs are involved in critical biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, amyloid-beta aggregation, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and autophagy, which are pivotal in AD development and progression. This systematic review aims to consolidate current scientific knowledge on the role of ncRNAs in AD, making it the first to encompass the four types of ncRNAs associated with the disease. Our comprehensive search and analysis reveal that ncRNAs not only play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AD but also hold potential as biomarkers for its early detection and as novel therapeutic targets. Specifically, the findings underscore the significance of miRNAs in regulating genes involved in key AD pathways such as activin receptor signaling pathway, actomyosin contractile ring organization, and advanced glycation endproducts-receptor advanced glycation endproducts (AGE-RAGE) signaling pathway. This review also highlights the potential of ncRNAs in unveiling novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the need for further research to validate their clinical utility. Our systematic exploration provides a foundation for future bioinformatic analyses and the development of ncRNA-based precision medicine approaches for AD, offering new insights into the disease's molecular pathology and paving the way for innovative treatment strategies.",PMC11243705,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11243705/
