Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common neurodegenerative disorders. AD is characterized by deposition of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, leading to associated secondary pathologies, progressive neurodegeneration, and eventually death. Currently used diagnostics are largely image-based, lack accuracy and do not detect early disease, ie, prior to onset of symptoms, thus limiting treatment options and outcomes. Although biomarkers such as amyloid-β and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid have gained much attention, these are generally limited to disease progression. Unfortunately, identification of biomarkers for early and accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. As such, body fluids such as sweat, serum, saliva, mucosa, tears, and urine are under investigation as alternative sources for biomarkers that can aid in early disease detection. This review focuses on biomarkers identified through proteomics in various biofluids and their potential for early and accurate diagnosis of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biofluid; Biomarker; Blood; CSF; Diagnosis; Saliva; Sweat; Tears,,"Rajendran, K; Krishnan, UM"

"The PREVENT dementia programme: baseline demographic, lifestyle, imaging and cognitive data from a midlife cohort study investigating risk factors for dementia.","PREVENT is a multi-centre prospective cohort study in the UK and Ireland that aims to examine midlife risk factors for dementia and identify and describe the earliest indices of disease development. The PREVENT dementia programme is one of the original epidemiological initiatives targeting midlife as a critical window for intervention in neurodegenerative conditions. This paper provides an overview of the study protocol and presents the first summary results from the initial baseline data to describe the cohort. Participants in the PREVENT cohort provide demographic data, biological samples (blood, saliva, urine and optional cerebrospinal fluid), lifestyle and psychological questionnaires, undergo a comprehensive cognitive test battery and are imaged using multi-modal 3-T MRI scanning, with both structural and functional sequences. The PREVENT cohort governance structure is described, which includes a steering committee, a scientific advisory board and core patient and public involvement groups. A number of sub-studies that supplement the main PREVENT cohort are also described. The PREVENT cohort baseline data include 700 participants recruited between 2014 and 2020 across five sites in the UK and Ireland (Cambridge, Dublin, Edinburgh, London and Oxford). At baseline, participants had a mean age of 51.2 years (range 40-59, SD ± 5.47), with the majority female (",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; brain health; observational cohort; preclinical dementia; risk factors,,"Ritchie, CW; Bridgeman, K; Gregory, S; O'Brien, JT; Danso, SO; Dounavi, ME; Carriere, I; Driscoll, D; Hillary, R; Koychev, I; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Su, L; Low, A; Mak, E; Malhotra, P; Manson, J; Marioni, R; Murphy, L; Ntailianis, G; Stewart, W; Muniz-Terrera, G; Ritchie, K"
The Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Neurodegenerative Disorders; Focus on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown great promise in the diagnosis, prediction, treatment plans, and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders. AI algorithms can analyze huge quantities of data from numerous sources, including medical images, quantifiable proteins in urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic information, clinical records, electroencephalography (EEG) signals, driving behaviors, and so forth.

Association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level and cognitive impairment in older chronic kidney disease patients.,"This study aims to examine whether hypovitaminosis D was associated with cognitive impairment among chronic kidney patients with different level of albuminuria. This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on elderly (over 60 years old) with urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g from 2011 to 2014 in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Cognitive function was assessed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Learning (CERAD). Subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the absence or presence of cognitive impairment and a propensity score matching (PSM) was further conducted. The association was assessed with Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis. The positive association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and cognitive score was presented. PSM analysis revealed that a higher level of 25(OH)D3 correlated to a better cognitive function in CKD patients with albuminuria, especially in patients with 30 mg/g ≤ UACR < 300 mg/g. This study indicated that a low 25(OH)D3 level was associated with poor cognitive performance, especially in patients with microalbuminuria. Thus, early diagnosis of vitamin D insufficiency and an effective intervention might be a useful therapeutic strategy to prevent cognitive decline in patients with the progression of renal dysfunction.",2024,,"Humans; Female; Male; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Calcifediol; Middle Aged; Albuminuria; Vitamin D Deficiency; Aged, 80 and over; Nutrition Surveys","Zhang, J; Zhang, A"
A Copper-Selective Sensor and Its Inhibition of Copper-Amyloid Beta Aggregation.,"Copper is an essential trace metal for biological processes in humans and animals. A low level of copper detection at physiological pH using fluorescent probes is very important for in vitro applications, such as the detection of copper in water or urine, and in vivo applications, such as tracking the dynamic copper concentrations inside cells. Copper homeostasis is disrupted in neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease, and copper forms aggregates with amyloid beta (Ab42) peptide, resulting in senile plaques in Alzheimer's brains. Therefore, a selective copper detector probe that can detect amyloid beta peptide-copper aggregates and decrease the aggregate size has potential uses in medicine.

Predicting exacerbation of renal function by DNA methylation clock and DNA damage of urinary shedding cells: a pilot study.,"Recent reports have shown the feasibility of measuring biological age from DNA methylation levels in blood cells from specific regions identified by machine learning, collectively known as the epigenetic clock or DNA methylation clock. While extensive research has explored the association of the DNA methylation clock with cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, its relationship with kidney diseases remains largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether the DNA methylation clock could serve as a predictor of worsening kidney function. In this pilot study involving 20 subjects, we investigated the association between the DNA methylation clock and subsequent deterioration of renal function. Additionally, we noninvasively evaluated DNA damage in urinary shedding cells using a previously reported method to examine the correlation with the DNA methylation clock and worsening kidney function. Our findings revealed that patients with an accelerated DNA methylation clock exhibited increased DNA damage in urinary shedding cells, along with a higher rate of eGFR decline. Moreover, in cases of advanced CKD (G4-5), the DNA damage in urinary shedding cells was significantly increased, highlighting the interplay between elevated DNA damage and eGFR decline. This study suggests the potential role of the DNA methylation clock and urinary DNA damage as predictive markers for the progression of chronic kidney disease.",2024,,"Humans; DNA Methylation; Pilot Projects; Male; DNA Damage; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; Kidney; Epigenesis, Genetic","Hishikawa, A; Nishimura, ES; Yoshimoto, N; Nakamichi, R; Hama, EY; Ito, W; Maruki, T; Nagashima, K; Shimizu-Hirota, R; Takaishi, H; Itoh, H; Hayashi, K"
Circulating Cell Free DNA and DNA Double-Strand Breakage in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. AD is pathologically characterized by age-dependent accumulation of amyloid-β protein and the phosphorylation of tau protein in the brains of patients with AD. Clinically, manifestations of AD include cognitive decline, dementia, alterations of high-order brain functions, and movement disorders. Double-stranded DNA breaks are a lethal form of DNA damage and are typically repaired via non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. However, in AD brain, repair mechanism is disrupted, leading to a cascade of events, cognitive dysfunction, organ failure and reduced lifespan. Increased circulating cell-free DNA in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine in patients with AD, can be used as early detectable biomarkers for AD. The purpose of our article is to explore the potential uses of cell-free DNA and double-stranded DNA breaks as prognostic markers for AD and examine the recent research on the application of these markers in studies.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; cell-free DNA; dementia; double-stranded DNA breaks,,"Nguyen, M; Wood, C; Rios, A; Salter, Z; Reddy, PH"

Specific Binding of Alzheimer's Aβ Peptides to Extracellular Vesicles.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth leading cause of death among adults aged 65 and older, yet the onset and progression of the disease is poorly understood. What is known is that the presence of amyloid, particularly polymerized Aβ42, defines when people are on the AD continuum. Interestingly, as AD progresses, less Aβ42 is detectable in the plasma, a phenomenon thought to result from Aβ becoming more aggregated in the brain and less Aβ42 and Aβ40 being transported from the brain to the plasma via the CSF. We propose that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in this transport. EVs are found in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid and carry diverse ""cargos"" of bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites) that dynamically reflect changes in the cells from which they are secreted. While Aβ42 and Aβ40 have been reported to be present in EVs, it is not known whether this interaction is specific for these peptides and thus whether amyloid-carrying EVs play a role in AD and/or serve as brain-specific biomarkers of the AD process. To determine if there is a specific interaction between Aβ and EVs, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and discovered that Aβ42 and Aβ40 bind to EVs in a manner that is sequence specific, saturable, and endothermic. In addition, Aβ incubation with EVs overnight yielded larger amounts of bound Aβ peptide that was fibrillar in structure. These findings point to a specific amyloid-EV interaction, a potential role for EVs in the transport of amyloid from the brain to the blood, and a role for this amyloid pool in the AD process.",2024,amyloid; atomic force microscopy (AFM); extracellular vesicles (EVs); isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),Adult; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Peptides; Extracellular Vesicles; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Plasma,"Coughlan, C; Lindenberger, J; Jacot, JG; Johnson, NR; Anton, P; Bevers, S; Welty, R; Graner, MW; Potter, H"
Surface protein profiling and subtyping of extracellular vesicles in body fluids reveals non-CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"Noninvasive and effortless diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains challenging. Here we report the multiplexed profiling of extracellular vesicle (EV) surface proteins at the single EV level in five types of easily accessible body fluids using a proximity barcoding assay (PBA). A total of 183 surface proteins were detected on the EVs from body fluids collected from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and patients with AD. The AD-associated differentially expressed EV proteins could discriminate between the control and AD/AD model samples with high accuracy. Based on machine learning predictive models, urinary EV proteins exhibited the highest diagnostic potential compared to those on other biofluid EVs, both in mice and humans. Single EV analysis further revealed AD-associated EV subpopulations in the tested body fluids, and a urinary EV subpopulation with the signature proteins PLAU, ITGAX and ANXA1 could diagnose patients with AD in blinded datasets with 88% accuracy. Our results suggest that EVs and their subpopulations from noninvasive body fluids, particularly urine, are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; diagnostic biomarker; extracellular vesicles; noninvasive body fluids; proximity barcoding assay; surface protein profiling,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Mice, Transgenic; Membrane Proteins; Body Fluids","Cai, Y; Chen, T; Cai, Y; Liu, J; Yu, B; Fan, Y; Su, J; Zeng, Y; Xiao, X; Ren, L; Tang, Y"

Urine proteome profile of firefighters with exposure to emergency fire-induced smoke: A pilot study to identify potential carcinogenic effects.,"Firefighters are frequently exposed to a variety of chemicals formed from smoke, which pose a risk for numerous diseases, including cancer. Comparative urine proteome profiling could significantly improve our understanding of the early detection of potential cancer biomarkers. In this study, for the first time, we conducted a comparative protein profile analysis of 20 urine samples collected from ten real-life firefighters prior to and following emergency fire-induced smoke. Using a label-free quantitative proteomics platform, we identified and quantified 1325 unique protein groups, of which 45 proteins showed differential expressions in abundance in response to fire-smoke exposure (post) compared to the control (pre). Pathway analysis showed proteins associated with epithelium development (e.g., RHCG, HEG1, ADAMTSL2) and Alzheimer's disease (SORL1) were significantly increased in response to smoke exposure samples. A protein-protein-network study showed a possible link between these differentially abundant proteins and the known cancer gene (TP53). Moreover, a cross-comparison analysis revealed that seven proteins-ALDH1A1, APCS, POMC, COL2A1, RDX, DDAH2, and SDC4 overlapped with the previously published urine cancer proteome datasets, suggesting a potential cancer risk. Our findings demonstrated that the discovery proteomic platform is a promising analytical technique for identifying potential non-invasive biomarkers associated with fire-smoke exposure in firefighters that may be related to cancer.",2024,Biomarkers; Cancer; Fire smoke; Firefighters; Proteomic; Urine,Firefighters; Humans; Pilot Projects; Smoke; Proteome; Occupational Exposure; Male; Biomarkers; Adult; Carcinogens; Proteomics,"Hwang, J; Peng, Z; Najar, FZ; Xu, C; Agnew, RJ; Xu, X; Yang, Z; Ahsan, N"

Assessment of social behavior and chemosensory cue detection in an animal model of neurodegeneration.,"Numerous studies have shown that aging in humans leads to a decline in olfactory function, resulting in deficits in acuity, detection threshold, discrimination, and olfactory-associated memories. Furthermore, impaired olfaction has been identified as a potential indicator for the onset of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies conducted on mouse models of AD have largely mirrored the findings in humans, thus providing a valuable system to investigate the cellular and circuit adaptations of the olfactory system during natural and pathological aging. However, the majority of previous research has focused on assessing the detection of neutral or synthetic odors, with little attention given to the impact of aging and neurodegeneration on the recognition of social cues-a critical feature for the survival of mammalian species. Therefore, in this study, we present a battery of olfactory tests that use conspecific urine samples to examine the changes in social odor recognition in a mouse model of neurodegeneration.",2024,Aging; Alzheimer's disease; Olfactory system; Social behavior; Social cues; Vomeronasal system,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Cues; Smell; Olfaction Disorders; Alzheimer Disease; Social Behavior; Disease Models, Animal; Mammals","Portalés, A; Sánchez-Aguilera, A; Royo, M; Jurado, S"
Evaluation of Exploratory Fluid Biomarker Results from a Phase 1 Senolytic Trial in Mild Alzheimer's Disease.,"Senescent cell accumulation contributes to the progression of age-related disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical trials evaluating senolytics, drugs that clear senescent cells, are underway, but lack standardized outcome measures. Our team recently published data from the first open-label trial to evaluate senolytics (dasatinib plus quercetin) in AD. After 12-weeks of intermittent treatment, we reported brain exposure to dasatinib, favorable safety and tolerability, and modest post-treatment changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory and AD biomarkers using commercially available assays. Herein, we present more comprehensive exploratory analyses of senolytic associated changes in AD relevant proteins, metabolites, lipids, and transcripts measured across blood, CSF, and urine. These analyses included mass spectrometry for precise quantification of amyloid beta (Aß) and tau in CSF; immunoassays to assess senescence associated secretory factors in plasma, CSF, and urine; mass spectrometry analysis of urinary metabolites and lipids in blood and CSF; and transcriptomic analyses relevant to chronic stress measured in peripheral blood cells. Levels of Aß and tau species remained stable. Targeted cytokine and chemokine analyses revealed treatment-associated increases in inflammatory plasma fractalkine and MMP-7 and CSF IL-6. Urinary metabolites remained unchanged. Modest treatment-associated lipid profile changes suggestive of decreased inflammation were observed both peripherally and centrally.

Heart rate and breathing effects on attention and memory (HeartBEAM): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial in older adults.,"In healthy people, the ""fight-or-flight"" sympathetic system is counterbalanced by the ""rest-and-digest"" parasympathetic system. As we grow older, the parasympathetic system declines as the sympathetic system becomes hyperactive. In our prior heart rate variability biofeedback and emotion regulation (HRV-ER) clinical trial, we found that increasing parasympathetic activity through daily practice of slow-paced breathing significantly decreased plasma amyloid-β (Aβ) in healthy younger and older adults. In healthy adults, higher plasma Aβ is associated with greater risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our primary goal of this trial is to reproduce and extend our initial findings regarding effects of slow-paced breathing on Aβ.

Whole-body metabolic modelling reveals microbiome and genomic interactions on reduced urine formate levels in Alzheimer's disease.,"In this study, we aimed to understand the potential role of the gut microbiome in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We took a multi-faceted approach to investigate this relationship. Urine metabolomics were examined in individuals with AD and controls, revealing decreased formate and fumarate concentrations in AD. Additionally, we utilised whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data obtained from a separate group of individuals with AD and controls. This information allowed us to create and investigate host-microbiome personalised whole-body metabolic models. Notably, AD individuals displayed diminished formate microbial secretion in these models. Additionally, we identified specific reactions responsible for the production of formate in the host, and interestingly, these reactions were linked to genes that have correlations with AD. This study suggests formate as a possible early AD marker and highlights genetic and microbiome contributions to its production. The reduced formate secretion and its genetic associations point to a complex connection between gut microbiota and AD. This holistic understanding might pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues in AD management.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Co-metabolism; Constraint-based modelling; Formate; Host-microbiome; Metabolic modelling; Metabolomics; Microbiome; Pathways,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Microbiota; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genomics; Formates,"Martinelli, F; Heinken, A; Henning, AK; Ulmer, MA; Hensen, T; González, A; Arnold, M; Asthana, S; Budde, K; Engelman, CD; Estaki, M; Grabe, HJ; Heston, MB; Johnson, S; Kastenmüller, G; Martino, C; McDonald, D; Rey, FE; Kilimann, I; Peters, O; Wang, X; Spruth, EJ; Schneider, A; Fliessbach, K; Wiltfang, J; Hansen, N; Glanz, W; Buerger, K; Janowitz, D; Laske, C; Munk, MH; Spottke, A; Roy, N; Nauck, M; Teipel, S; Knight, R; Kaddurah-Daouk, RF; Bendlin, BB; Hertel, J; Thiele, I"

Urine biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: A new opportunity for wastewater-based epidemiology?,"While Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, management, and care have become priorities for healthcare providers and researcher's worldwide due to rapid population aging, epidemiologic surveillance efforts are currently limited by costly, invasive diagnostic procedures, particularly in low to middle income countries (LMIC). In recent years, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a promising tool for public health assessment through detection and quantification of specific biomarkers in wastewater, but applications for non-infectious diseases such as AD remain limited. This early review seeks to summarize AD-related biomarkers and urine and other peripheral biofluids and discuss their potential integration to WBE platforms to guide the first prospective efforts in the field. Promising results have been reported in clinical settings, indicating the potential of amyloid β, tau, neural thread protein, long non-coding RNAs, oxidative stress markers and other dysregulated metabolites for AD diagnosis, but questions regarding their concentration and stability in wastewater and the correlation between clinical levels and sewage circulation must be addressed in future studies before comprehensive WBE systems can be developed.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Alzheimer’s disease Biomarkers; Proteins; Urine molecules; Wastewater-based epidemiology; lncRNAs,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring; Wastewater; Prospective Studies; Biomarkers,"Armenta-Castro, A; Núñez-Soto, MT; Rodriguez-Aguillón, KO; Aguayo-Acosta, A; Oyervides-Muñoz, MA; Snyder, SA; Barceló, D; Saththasivam, J; Lawler, J; Sosa-Hernández, JE; Parra-Saldívar, R"

Digital remote monitoring for screening and early detection of urinary tract infections.,"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are one of the most prevalent bacterial infections in older adults and a significant contributor to unplanned hospital admissions in People Living with Dementia (PLWD), with early detection being crucial due to the predicament of reporting symptoms and limited help-seeking behaviour. The most common diagnostic tool is urine sample analysis, which can be time-consuming and is only employed where UTI clinical suspicion exists. In this method development and proof-of-concept study, participants living with dementia were monitored via low-cost devices in the home that passively measure activity, sleep, and nocturnal physiology. Using 27828 person-days of remote monitoring data (from 117 participants), we engineered features representing symptoms used for diagnosing a UTI. We then evaluate explainable machine learning techniques in passively calculating UTI risk and perform stratification on scores to support clinical translation and allow control over the balance between alert rate and sensitivity and specificity. The proposed UTI algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 65.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 64.3-66.2) and specificity of 70.9% (68.6-73.1) when predicting UTIs on unseen participants and after risk stratification, a sensitivity of 74.7% (67.9-81.5) and specificity of 87.9% (85.0-90.9). In addition, feature importance methods reveal that the largest contributions to the predictions were bathroom visit statistics, night-time respiratory rate, and the number of previous UTI events, aligning with the literature. Our machine learning method alerts clinicians of UTI risk in subjects, enabling earlier detection and enhanced screening when considering treatment.",2024,,,"Capstick, A; Palermo, F; Zakka, K; Fletcher-Lloyd, N; Walsh, C; Cui, T; Kouchaki, S; Jackson, R; Tran, M; Crone, M; Jensen, K; Freemont, P; Vaidyanathan, R; Kolanko, M; True, J; Daniels, S; Wingfield, D; Nilforooshan, R; Barnaghi, P"

After three weeks of D-galactose injection, bilateral hippocampal Aβ_(25-35) injections were performed for modeling. The rats were administrated with corresponding drugs(10 mL·kg~(-1)) by gavage since week 2, and the rats in the model and control group with an equal volume of double distilled water once a day for 35 continuous days. The memory behaviour and pathological changes in the hippocampal tissue were observed. The untargeted metabolites in the urine were detected by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q/TOF-MS). Principal component analysis(PCA) and orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA) were employed to characterize and screen differential metabolites and potential biomarkers, for which the metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was conducted. The results indicated that BBPR and SPR increased the new object recognition index, shortened the escape latency, and increased the times of crossing the platform of AD rats in the Morris water maze test. The results of hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining showed that the cells in the hippocampal tissue of the drug administration groups were closely arranged. Moreover, the drugs reduced the content of interleukin-6(IL-6, P&lt;0.01) and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) in the hippocampal tissue, which were more obvious in the BBPR group(P&lt;0.05). After screening, 15 potential biomarkers were identified, involving two metabolic pathways: dicoumarol pathway and piroxicam pathway. BBPR and SPR may alleviate AD by regulating the metabolism of dicoumarol and piroxicam.",2023,Alzheimer′s disease(AD); UPLC-Q/TOF-MS; black bean-processed Polygonati Rhizoma(BBPR); metabolomics; stewed Polygonati Rhizoma(SPR),"Rats; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dicumarol; Galactose; Piroxicam; Metabolomics; Biomarkers","Zhu, N; Zhu, XD; Yang, YS; Yan, FX; Zhang, P; Wan, LC; Wu, Y; Huang, LP"

UPLC-Q-TOF/MS based serum and urine metabolomics strategy to analyze the mechanism of nervonic acid in treating Alzheimer's disease.,"Nervonic acid is a natural component of breast milk and is frequently used as a food additive due to its excellent neuroprotective effects. Although it has been reported that nervonic acid may play a role in the recovery of human cognitive impairment, its specific mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, the results of serum biochemical indexes showed that nervonic acid improved inflammation and reduced amyloid β peptide (Aβ) deposition and tau protein phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. Subsequently, we further used a metabolomics approach to investigate the potential mechanism of action of nervonic acid in the treatment of AD. The results of serum and urine metabolomics study showed that the intervention of nervonic acid significantly reversed the metabolic profile disorder in AD rats. A total of 52 metabolites were identified. They mainly involved linoleic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism, and all these metabolic pathways were associated with the emergence of inflammation in vivo. It suggests that the therapeutic effect of nervonic acid on AD is likely to be produced by ameliorating inflammation. The results obtained in this study provide new insights into the mechanism of nervonic acid treatment of AD and lay a foundation for the clinical application of nervonic acid in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Inflammation; Metabolomics; Nervonic acid; Unsaturate fatty acid,"Humans; Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Metabolomics; Inflammation; Biomarkers; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated","Chen, Z; Liu, S; Zhou, H; Wang, M; Pei, S; Wang, R; Liu, Z"
Memantine Improves Memory and Neurochemical Damage in a Model of Maple Syrup Urine Disease.,"Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is a metabolic disease characterized by the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in different tissues due to a deficit in the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The most common symptoms are poor feeding, psychomotor delay, and neurological damage. However, dietary therapy is not effective. Studies have demonstrated that memantine improves neurological damage in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, we hypothesize that memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist can ameliorate the effects elicited by BCAA in an MSUD animal model. For this, we organized the rats into four groups: control group (1), MSUD group (2), memantine group (3), and MSUD + memantine group (4). Animals were exposed to the MSUD model by the administration of BCAA (15.8 µL/g) (groups 2 and 4) or saline solution (0.9%) (groups 1 and 3) and treated with water or memantine (5 mg/kg) (groups 3 and 4). Our results showed that BCAA administration induced memory alterations, and changes in the levels of acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, induction of oxidative damage and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities along with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines were verified in the cerebral cortex. Thus, memantine treatment prevented the alterations in memory, acetylcholinesterase activity, 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein oxidation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels, sulfhydryl content, and inflammation. These findings suggest that memantine can improve the pathomechanisms observed in the MSUD model, and may improve oxidative stress, inflammation, and behavior alterations.",2024,Cholinergic system; High leucine; Inflammation; Oxidative stress; branched-chain amino acids,"Rats; Animals; Maple Syrup Urine Disease; Memantine; Acetylcholinesterase; Disease Models, Animal; Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Antioxidants; Inflammation","Lemos, IDS; Torres, CA; Alano, CG; Matiola, RT; de Figueiredo Seldenreich, R; Padilha, APZ; De Pieri, E; Effting, PS; Machado-De-Ávila, RA; Réus, GZ; Leipnitz, G; Streck, EL"
NMR-based metabolomics in Alzheimer's disease research: a review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population worldwide. Currently, there is no cure for AD, and the continuous increase in the number of susceptible individuals poses one of the most significant emerging threats to public health. However, the molecular pathways involved in the onset and progression of AD are not fully understood. This information is crucial for developing less invasive diagnostic instruments and discovering novel potential therapeutic targets. Metabolomics studies the complete ensemble of endogenous and exogenous metabolites present in biological specimens and may provide an interesting approach to identify alterations in multiple biochemical processes associated with AD onset and evolution. In this mini review, we summarize the results from metabolomic studies conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on human biological samples (blood derivatives, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, and tissues) from AD patients. We describe the metabolic alterations identified in AD patients compared to controls and to patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, we discuss the challenges and issues associated with the application of NMR-based metabolomics in the context of AD research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; NMR; lipoproteins; metabolites; mild cognitive impairment,,"Vignoli, A; Tenori, L"

Innovative SALDI mass spectrometry analysis for Alzheimer's disease synthetic peptides detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is nowadays the prominent cause of senile dementia. This pathology is characterized by aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles in cells and by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Noteworthy, a phosphorylated protein (tau protein) and a peptide presenting two overlapping sequences of 40 or 42 residues named β-amyloid peptides 1-40 (Aβ 1-40) and 1-42 (Aβ 1-42), respectively, were related to such deleterious phenomena. Singularly, the neurotoxicity was primarily attributed to the amyloid peptide Aβ 1-42 form due to its capacity to fold into beta-sheets rendering it insoluble thus causing subsequent aggregation and accumulation in vivo. Regarding AD diagnosis relying on mass spectrometry, Aβ 1-42 and/or Aβ 1-40 were considered as relevant biomarkers being measured in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), blood and urine. Under that context, we aimed at implementing an innovative method to evidence the depletion of circulating Aβ 1-42 amyloid peptide compared to the shorter Aβ 1-40 form indicating a pathologic state. We investigated Surface-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SALDI-MS) in order to monitor the Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 ratio without any prior sample treatment or enrichment. Taking into account that β-amyloid peptide and 1-42 can aggregate into beta-sheets depending on the experimental conditions, specific attention was devoted to sample integrity monitoring performed by circular dichroism experiments during SALDI-MS method development.",2024,CD; Imaging MS; Nanoneedles; Nanowires; SALDI-MS; β-Amyloid peptides,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Plaque, Amyloid; Biomarkers","Cournut, A; Moustiez, P; Coffinier, Y; Enjalbal, C; Bich, C"

Characteristics of Nationwide Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Visits by Age and Type II Diabetes Status in Women.,"Background Through a national database search of office visits, we studied the contribution of two known risk factors for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women: age and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methodology The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) database was queried for visits including a UTI diagnosis and a urine culture order. Data were included for all visits involving adult women for available years, 2014-2016 and 2018. Data on demographics, reason for visit, T2DM status, UTI workup, and UTI treatment were collected. Patients with Alzheimer's disease or chronic kidney disease were excluded. Descriptive statistics were displayed as weighted means with standard errors for continuous variables. The effect of age was compared based on a 65-year-old cutoff. Results One hundred sixty-seven surveyed visits were analyzed for the years 2014-2016 and 2018, representing an estimated 7.4 million visits nationwide. Women ≥65 years were more likely to be white, non-Hispanic/non-Latino, from the Midwest or West, from metropolitan areas, and on Medicare/Medicaid than their younger counterparts.

Establishing an online resource to facilitate global collaboration and inclusion of underrepresented populations: Experience from the MJFF Global Genetic Parkinson's Disease Project.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, currently affecting ~7 million people worldwide. PD is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with at least 10% of all cases explained by a monogenic cause or strong genetic risk factor. However, the vast majority of our present data on monogenic PD is based on the investigation of patients of European White ancestry, leaving a large knowledge gap on monogenic PD in underrepresented populations. Gene-targeted therapies are being developed at a fast pace and have started entering clinical trials. In light of these developments, building a global network of centers working on monogenic PD, fostering collaborative research, and establishing a clinical trial-ready cohort is imperative. Based on a systematic review of the English literature on monogenic PD and a successful team science approach, we have built up a network of 59 sites worldwide and have collected information on the availability of data, biomaterials, and facilities. To enable access to this resource and to foster collaboration across centers, as well as between academia and industry, we have developed an interactive map and online tool allowing for a quick overview of available resources, along with an option to filter for specific items of interest. This initiative is currently being merged with the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2), which will attract additional centers with a focus on underrepresented sites. This growing resource and tool will facilitate collaborative research and impact the development and testing of new therapies for monogenic and potentially for idiopathic PD patients.",2023,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Palliative Care,"Vollstedt, EJ; Madoev, H; Aasly, A; Ahmad-Annuar, A; Al-Mubarak, B; Alcalay, RN; Alvarez, V; Amorin, I; Annesi, G; Arkadir, D; Bardien, S; Barker, RA; Barkhuizen, M; Basak, AN; Bonifati, V; Boon, A; Brighina, L; Brockmann, K; Carmine Belin, A; Carr, J; Clarimon, J; Cornejo-Olivas, M; Correia Guedes, L; Corvol, JC; Crosiers, D; Damásio, J; Das, P; de Carvalho Aguiar, P; De Rosa, A; Dorszewska, J; Ertan, S; Ferese, R; Ferreira, J; Gatto, E; Genç, G; Giladi, N; Gómez-Garre, P; Hanagasi, H; Hattori, N; Hentati, F; Hoffman-Zacharska, D; Illarioshkin, SN; Jankovic, J; Jesús, S; Kaasinen, V; Kievit, A; Klivenyi, P; Kostic, V; Koziorowski, D; Kühn, AA; Lang, AE; Lim, SY; Lin, CH; Lohmann, K; Markovic, V; Martikainen, MH; Mellick, G; Merello, M; Milanowski, L; Mir, P; Öztop-Çakmak, Ö; Pimentel, MMG; Pulkes, T; Puschmann, A; Rogaeva, E; Sammler, EM; Skaalum Petersen, M; Skorvanek, M; Spitz, M; Suchowersky, O; Tan, AH; Termsarasab, P; Thaler, A; Tumas, V; Valente, EM; van de Warrenburg, B; Williams-Gray, CH; Wu, RM; Zhang, B; Zimprich, A; Solle, J; Padmanabhan, S; Klein, C"
Neuro-Urology and Biobanking: An Integrated Approach for Advancing Research and Improving Patient Care.,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neuro-urological disorders is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Through the establishment of comprehensive biobanks, researchers can collect and store various biological specimens, including urine, blood, tissue, and DNA samples, to study these mechanisms. In the context of neuro-urology, biobanking facilitates the identification of genetic variations, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression patterns associated with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. These conditions often present as symptoms of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, and many others. Biobanking of tissue specimens from such patients is essential to understand why these diseases cause the respective symptoms and what can be done to alleviate them. The utilization of high-throughput technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and gene expression profiling, enables researchers to explore the molecular landscape of these conditions in an unprecedented manner. The development of specific and reliable biomarkers resulting from these efforts may help in early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective monitoring of neuro-urological conditions, leading to improved patient care and management. Furthermore, these biomarkers could potentially facilitate the monitoring of novel therapies currently under investigation in neuro-urological clinical trials. This comprehensive review explores the synergistic integration of neuro-urology and biobanking, with particular emphasis on the translation of biobanking approaches in molecular research in neuro-urology. We discuss the advantages of biobanking in neuro-urological studies, the types of specimens collected and their applications in translational research. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of standardization and quality assurance when collecting samples and discuss challenges that may compromise sample quality and impose limitations on their subsequent utilization. Finally, we give recommendations for sampling in multicenter studies, examine sustainability issues associated with biobanking, and provide future directions for this dynamic field.",2023,biobank; biomarker; biorepository; biospecimen; lower urinary tract symptoms; neuro-urology; neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction; translational research,Humans; Urology; Biological Specimen Banks; Patient Care; Neurology; Alzheimer Disease,"Botter, SM; Kessler, TM"
A Multiplexed Urinary Biomarker Panel Has Potential for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using Targeted Proteomics and Machine Learning.,"As disease-modifying therapies are now available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), accessible, accurate and affordable biomarkers to support diagnosis are urgently needed. We sought to develop a mass spectrometry-based urine test as a high-throughput screening tool for diagnosing AD. We collected urine from a discovery cohort (n = 11) of well-characterised individuals with AD (n = 6) and their asymptomatic, CSF biomarker-negative study partners (n = 5) and used untargeted proteomics for biomarker discovery. Protein biomarkers identified were taken forward to develop a high-throughput, multiplexed and targeted proteomic assay which was tested on an independent cohort (n = 21). The panel of proteins identified are known to be involved in AD pathogenesis. In comparing AD and controls, a panel of proteins including MIEN1, TNFB, VCAM1, REG1B and ABCA7 had a classification accuracy of 86%. These proteins have been previously implicated in AD pathogenesis. This suggests that urine-targeted mass spectrometry has potential utility as a diagnostic screening tool in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s; biomarkers; diagnosis; machine learning; mass spectrometry; proteomics; urine,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Proteomics; Urinary Tract; Machine Learning; Biomarkers; Neoplasm Proteins; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,"Hällqvist, J; Pinto, RC; Heywood, WE; Cordey, J; Foulkes, AJM; Slattery, CF; Leckey, CA; Murphy, EC; Zetterberg, H; Schott, JM; Mills, K; Paterson, RW"

Whole-body modelling reveals microbiome and genomic interactions on reduced urine formate levels in Alzheimer's disease.,"In this study, we aimed to understand the potential role of the gut microbiome in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We took a multi-faceted approach to investigate this relationship. Urine metabolomics were examined in individuals with AD and controls, revealing decreased formate and fumarate concentrations in AD. Additionally, we utilized whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data obtained from a separate group of individuals with AD and controls. This information allowed us to create and investigate host-microbiome personalized models. Notably, AD individuals displayed diminished formate microbial secretion in these models. Additionally, we identified specific reactions responsible for the production of formate in the host, and interestingly, these reactions were linked to genes that have correlations with AD. This study suggests formate as a possible early AD marker and highlights genetic and microbiome contributions to its production. The reduced formate secretion and its genetic associations point to a complex connection between gut microbiota and AD.

Isoniazid derivatization strategy of carboxyl-containing metabolites for LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics.,"Metabolomics is a biochemical analysis tool for identifying metabolic phenotypes and used to reveal the pathogenic mechanisms of disease and to inform drug-targeted therapies. Carboxyl-containing metabolites (CCMs) account for an important proportion of the metabolome, but because of the diversity of physical and chemical properties of CCMs in biological samples, traditional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) targeted metabolome analysis methods cannot achieve simultaneous quantification of multiple types of CCMs. Therefore, we proposed for the first time a targeted metabolomics strategy using isoniazid derivatization combined with LC-MS/MS to simultaneously quantify 39 CCMs of 5 different types (short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, bile acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolic pathway acids) with large polarity differences associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and significantly improve the detection coverage and sensitivity. The yields of isoniazid derivative CCMs were high and could guarantee the accuracy of CCM quantification. The LODs of CCMs increased significantly (1.25-2000-fold) after derivatization. The method showed good selectivity, intra-day and inter-day accuracies and precisions, and repeatability. There was no significant effect on the determination of CCMs in terms of matrix effect and recovery. CCMs showed good stability. And CCMs showed good stability under short-term storage and freeze-thaw cycles. At the same time, the regulatory effects of Schisandrae chinensis Fructus and Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma (SG) herb pair on CCM metabolic disorders in feces, urine, serum, and the brain of AD rats were elucidated from the perspective of targeted metabolomics. In combination with pharmacodynamic evaluation and gut microbiota analysis, the mechanism of SG herb pair on AD rats was comprehensively understood. In summary, this innovative isoniazid derivatization combined with a targeted metabolomics method has great potential for trace biological lineage analysis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Carboxyl-containing metabolites; Isoniazid derivatization; Targeted metabolomics,,"Wang, A; Fan, Y; Fu, J; Song, F; Liu, Z; Liu, S"

A Protease-Responsive Polymer/Peptide Conjugate and Reversible Assembly of Silver Clusters for the Detection of ,"We report the reversible aggregation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) assemblies using the combination of a cationic arginine-based peptide and sulfur-capped polyethylene glycol (PEG). The formation and dissociation of the aggregates were studied by optical methods and electron microscopy. The dissociation of silver clusters depends on the peptide sequence and PEG size. A molecular weight of 1 kDa for PEG was optimal for the dissociation. The most important feature of this dissociation method is that it can operate in complex biofluids such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell media, or even seawater without a significant decrease in performance. Moreover, the peptide-particle assemblies are highly stable and do not degrade (or express of loss of signal upon dissociation) when dried and resolubilized, frozen and thawed, or left in daylight for a month. Importantly, the dissociation capacity of PEG can be reduced via the conjugation of a peptide-cleavable substrate. The dissociation capacity is restored in the presence of an enzyme. Based on these findings, we designed a PEG-peptide hybrid molecule specific to the ",2023,P. gingivalis; PEG; peptides; periodontitis; protease sensing; reversible assembly; silver nanoparticles,Peptide Hydrolases; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Silver; Polymers; Metal Nanoparticles; Endopeptidases; Peptides; Polyethylene Glycols,"Retout, M; Amer, L; Yim, W; Creyer, MN; Lam, B; Trujillo, DF; Potempa, J; O'Donoghue, AJ; Chen, C; Jokerst, JV"

Efficacy evaluation and metabolomics analysis of Huanglian Jiedu decoction in combination with donepezil for Alzheimer's disease treatment.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease with continuous brain changes and has caused a severe burden on families and society. Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJD) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine formula that can improve AD animals' cognitive impairment. This study recruited 50 AD patients who were divided into two groups, one receiving donepezil (DON) treatment and the other receiving DON + HLJD treatment for 3 months. The curative effect, inflammatory and oxidative stress levels were analyzed. The PES-D/11, MMSE, and ADL scales were used to evaluate traditional Chinese medicine syndrome elements, cognitive function, mental state, and life ability. There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics and vital sign indicators. After drug treatment, the results showed that AD patients with HLJD combined with DON treatment didn't increase the adverse effects and had good compliance. HLJD combined with DON could improve the disease syndrome, making the differences in PES-D/11, MMSE, and ADL scores before and after the intervention larger. Furthermore, both DON and DON+HLJD treatment inhibited the levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MDA, raised SOD level, and HLJD enhances the inhibitory effect of DON on inflammation and oxidative stress. IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MDA levels were significantly correlated with curative effect. Moreover, this study found 107 (206) up-regulated metabolites and 1430 (145) down-regulated metabolites in urine (serum) and conducted differential metabolite screening and correlation analysis suggesting that HLJD may interfere with oxidative stress and inflammation in AD by regulating lipid metabolism and glutamic acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid, diaminopimelic acid, and 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid may play an important role in HLJD to improve AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Huanglian Jiedu Decoction; Inflammation; Metabolomics; Oxidative stress,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Donepezil; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Interleukin-6; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Metabolomics; Inflammation","Xu, M; Yue, Y; Huang, J"
Liquid Biopsy in Neurological Diseases.,"The most recent and non-invasive approach for studying early-stage biomarkers is liquid biopsy. This implies the extraction and analysis of non-solid biological tissues (serum, plasma, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid) without undergoing invasive procedures to determine disease prognosis. Liquid biopsy can be used for the screening of several components, such as extracellular vesicles, microRNAs, cell-free DNA, cell-free mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, transfer RNA, and circular DNA or RNA derived from body fluids. Its application includes early disease diagnosis, the surveillance of disease activity, and treatment response monitoring, with growing evidence for validating this methodology in cancer, liver disease, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This review will provide an overview of mentioned liquid biopsy components, which could serve as valuable biomarkers for the evaluation of complex neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, CNS tumours, and neuroinfectious diseases. Furthermore, this review highlights the future directions and potential limitations associated with liquid biopsy.",2023,cfDNA; liquid biopsy; microRNA; neurological diseases,Humans; Liquid Biopsy; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; MicroRNAs; Central Nervous System Neoplasms; Biomarkers,"Malhotra, S; Miras, MCM; Pappolla, A; Montalban, X; Comabella, M"
Characterization of chemical constituents and metabolites in vivo and in vitro after oral administration of Wuteng tablets in rats by UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS.,"Waste medicinal plants are widely used in drug production. With the increasing demand for botanical drugs, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective drugs and improve the utilization of medicinal plant resources. Wuteng tablets (WTP) are extracted from the stem of Schisandra chinensis and have a good therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease. In this study, a holistic identification strategy based on UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS was developed for the first time to investigate the metabolites and metabolic pathways involved in the in vitro metabolism and liver microsomal incubation and in the in vivo metabolic system of rats after WTP administration. After the oral administration of WTP, 21 metabolites were identified in the serum and 25 metabolites were identified in the urine, of which six were new metabolites; 33 metabolites were inferred from the microsomal metabolites in vitro. The metabolic pathways related to WTP mainly involve demethylation, hydroxylation, dehydroxylation and dehydrogenation. In this study, the metabolites and metabolic pathways of WTP were elucidated via UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS, which provided a basis for an in-depth study of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacotoxicological effects of WTP.",2023,Schisandra chinensis; UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS; Wuteng tablet; metabolomics,"Rats; Animals; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Administration, Oral; Alzheimer Disease; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Drugs, Chinese Herbal","Chen, P; Pang, C; Xu, T; Dong, P; Han, H"
The role of exosomes in adult neurogenesis: implications for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Exosomes are cup-shaped extracellular vesicles with a lipid bilayer that is approximately 30 to 200 nm in thickness. Exosomes are widely distributed in a range of body fluids, including urine, blood, milk, and saliva. Exosomes exert biological function by transporting factors between different cells and by regulating biological pathways in recipient cells. As an important form of intercellular communication, exosomes are increasingly being investigated due to their ability to transfer bioactive molecules such as lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs between cells, and because they can regulate physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system. Adult neurogenesis is a multistage process by which new neurons are generated and migrate to be integrated into existing neuronal circuits. In the adult brain, neurogenesis is mainly localized in two specialized niches: the subventricular zone adjacent to the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. An increasing body of evidence indicates that adult neurogenesis is tightly controlled by environmental conditions with the niches. In recent studies, exosomes released from different sources of cells were shown to play an active role in regulating neurogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, thereby participating in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders in patients and in various disease models. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art synopsis of existing research that aimed to identify the diverse components of exosome cargoes and elucidate the therapeutic potential of exosomal contents in the regulation of neurogenesis in several neurodegenerative diseases. We emphasize that exosomal cargoes could serve as a potential biomarker to monitor functional neurogenesis in adults. In addition, exosomes can also be considered as a novel therapeutic approach to treat various neurodegenerative disorders by improving endogenous neurogenesis to mitigate neuronal loss in the central nervous system.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Huntington’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; adult neurogenesis; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; exosome; neurodegenerative disease; neurogenic niches,,"Yu, Z; Teng, Y; Yang, J; Yang, L"
Urinary Cytokines as Potential Biomarkers of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: A Pilot Study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 80% of all cases.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and changes in brain cortical thickness and an Alzheimer's disease-specific marker for cortical atrophy in adults: A longitudinal neuroimaging study of the EPINEF cohort.,"Although several epidemiological studies have suggested that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may induce brain atrophy, no longitudinal study has investigated the effect of PAH exposure on brain structural changes. This study examined the longitudinal associations between urinary PAH metabolites and brain cortical thickness. We obtained urinary concentrations of PAH metabolites and brain magnetic resonance images from 327 adults (≥50 years of age) without dementia at baseline and 3-year follow-up. We obtained whole-brain and regional cortical thicknesses, as well as an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-specific marker for cortical atrophy (a higher score indicated a greater similarity to patients with AD) at baseline and follow-up. We built a linear mixed-effect model including each of urinary PAH metabolites as the time-varying exposure variable of interest. We found that increases in urinary concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene (β = -0.004; 95% CI, -0.008 to -0.001) and 2-hydroxyfluorene (β = -0.011; 95% CI, -0.015 to -0.006) were significantly associated with a reduced whole-brain cortical thickness. A urinary concentration of 2-hydroxyfluorene was significantly associated with an increased AD-specific cortical atrophy score (β = 2.031; 95% CI, 0.512 to 3.550). The specific brain regions showing the association of urinary concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene, 2-naphthol, 1-hydroxyphenanthrene, or 2-hydroxyfluorene with cortical thinning were the frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate lobes. These findings suggested that exposure to PAHs may reduce brain cortical thickness and increase the similarity to AD-specific cortical atrophy patterns in adults.",2023,Cortical thickness; Linear mixed model; Neuroimaging; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon,Humans; Adult; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Alzheimer Disease; Brain Cortical Thickness; Neuroimaging; Atrophy; Biomarkers,"Cho, J; Sohn, J; Yang, SH; Lee, SK; Noh, Y; Oh, SS; Koh, SB; Kim, C"
Saliva: a challenging human fluid to diagnose brain disorders with a focus on Alzheimer's disease.,"Biomarkers are molecules of biological processes that help in both the diagnosis of human diseases and in follow-up assessments of therapeutic responses. Biomarkers can be measured in many human fluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva. The -omics methods (genomics, RNomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are useful at measuring thousands of markers in a small volume. Saliva is a human fluid that is easily accessible, without any ethical concerns. Yet, saliva remains unexplored in regard to many human disease biomarkers. In this review, we will give an overview on saliva and how it can be influenced by exogenous factors. As we focus on the potential use of saliva as a diagnostic tool in brain disorders (especially Alzheimer's disease), we will cover how saliva is linked to the brain. We will discuss that saliva is a heterogeneous human fluid, yet useful for the discovery of biomarkers in human disorders. However, a procedure and consensus that is controlled, validated, and standardized for the collection and processing of saliva is required, followed by a highly sensitive diagnostic approach.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; diagnosis; oral-gut-brain axis; periodontitis; saliva,,"Zürcher, C; Humpel, C"

Case report: Evolution of catatonic mutism and psychotic symptoms in an adolescent with Down syndrome: transition from Down syndrome disintegrative disorder to anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.,"During her first year of junior high school, a 12-year-old Japanese girl with Down syndrome experienced dizziness, gait disruption, paroxysmal weakness in her hands, and sluggish speaking. Regular blood tests and a brain MRI revealed no abnormalities, and she was tentatively diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Nine months later, the patient experienced a subacute sickness of chest pain, nausea, sleep problem with night terrors, and delusion of observation. Rapid deterioration then developed with simultaneous fever, akinetic mutism, loss of facial expression, and urine incontinence. These catatonic symptoms improved after a few weeks after admission and treatment with lorazepam, escitalopram, and aripiprazole. After discharge, nonetheless, daytime slumber, empty eyes, paradoxical laughter, and declined verbal communication persisted. Upon confirmation of the cerebrospinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoantibody, methylprednisolone pulse therapy was tried, but it had little effect. Visual hallucinations and cenesthopathy, as well as suicidal thoughts and delusions of death, have predominated in the following years. Cerebrospinal IL-1ra, IL-5, IL-15, CCL5, G-CSF, PDGFbb, and VFGF were raised in the early stage of initial medical attention with nonspecific complaints, but were less prominent in the later stages of catatonic mutism and psychotic symptoms.

Effects of donepezil treatment on plasma and urine metabolites in amyloid beta-induced Alzheimer's disease rats.,"Accumulated clinical and biomedical evidence suggests that abnormalities in systemic metabolic processes such as fatty acid and amino acid metabolism can affect the brain function and behavior of various central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, metabolic profiling was used to investigate changes in plasma and urine metabolites following stereotactic injection of amyloid β (Aβ) and treatment with donepezil in rats. Aβ causes cognitive impairment, while donepezil treatment successfully improves memory impairment. Donepezil improves Aβ-induced plasma fatty acid and bile acid metabolism disorders, as well as Aβ-induced urine phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolism disorders in rats. More specifically, the plasma fatty acids improved by donepezil include alpha-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid, among others. Additionally, donepezil significantly restored the downregulation of bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and glycocholic acid caused by Aβ. As for urine metabolites, phenylacetylglycine, epinephrine, and other phenylalanine metabolites, as well as kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, and other tryptophan metabolites, were worsened by Aβ and improved by donepezil. These findings suggest that the cognitive impairment induced by Aβ and the improvement by donepezil are associated with changes in metabolic disorders in rats. This study provides basic data for the effects of Aβ and donepezil on plasma and urine metabolites in Aβ-induced AD rat models.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Donepezil; Metabolomics; UPLC-Q-TOF-MS,"Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Donepezil; Tryptophan; Fatty Acids; Disease Models, Animal","Huang, H; Fang, C; Niu, H; Yin, X; Ruan, J; Wei, M; Zhou, Y"
Dietary flavanols restore hippocampal-dependent memory in older adults with lower diet quality and lower habitual flavanol consumption.,"Dietary flavanols are food constituents found in certain fruits and vegetables that have been linked to cognitive aging. Previous studies suggested that consumption of dietary flavanols might specifically be associated with the hippocampal-dependent memory component of cognitive aging and that memory benefits of a flavanol intervention might depend on habitual diet quality. Here, we tested these hypotheses in the context of a large-scale study of 3,562 older adults, who were randomly assigned to a 3-y intervention of cocoa extract (500 mg of cocoa flavanols per day) or a placebo [(COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study) COSMOS-Web, NCT04582617]. Using the alternative Healthy Eating Index in all participants and a urine-based biomarker of flavanol intake in a subset of participants [n = 1,361], we show that habitual flavanol consumption and diet quality at baseline are positively and selectively correlated with hippocampal-dependent memory. While the prespecified primary end point testing for an intervention-related improvement in memory in all participants after 1 y was not statistically significant, the flavanol intervention restored memory among participants in lower tertiles of habitual diet quality or habitual flavanol consumption. Increases in the flavanol biomarker over the course of the trial were associated with improving memory. Collectively, our results allow dietary flavanols to be considered in the context of a depletion-repletion paradigm and suggest that low flavanol consumption can act as a driver of the hippocampal-dependent component of cognitive aging.",2023,cognitive aging; dietary flavanols; hippocampus,Humans; Aged; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Polyphenols; Biomarkers; Cacao; Double-Blind Method,"Brickman, AM; Yeung, LK; Alschuler, DM; Ottaviani, JI; Kuhnle, GGC; Sloan, RP; Luttmann-Gibson, H; Copeland, T; Schroeter, H; Sesso, HD; Manson, JE; Wall, M; Small, SA"
Structural-Activity Relationship of Rare Ginsenosides from Red Ginseng in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Rare ginsenosides are the major components of red ginseng.

In this work, BV-2 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or nigericin, the anti-inflammatory activity of eight rare ginsenosides, and the target proteins expression of AD were compared. In addition, the Morris water maze test, HE staining, thioflavins staining, and urine metabonomics were used to evaluate the effect of Rh4 on AD mice.

Urinary Biomarkers and Point-of-Care Urinalysis Devices for Early Diagnosis and Management of Disease: A Review.,"Biosensing and microfluidics technologies are transforming diagnostic medicine by accurately detecting biomolecules in biological samples. Urine is a promising biological fluid for diagnostics due to its noninvasive collection and wide range of diagnostic biomarkers. Point-of-care urinalysis, which integrates biosensing and microfluidics, has the potential to bring affordable and rapid diagnostics into the home to continuing monitoring, but challenges still remain. As such, this review aims to provide an overview of biomarkers that are or could be used to diagnose and monitor diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the different materials and techniques for the fabrication of microfluidic structures along with the biosensing technologies often used to detect and quantify biological molecules and organisms are reviewed. Ultimately, this review discusses the current state of point-of-care urinalysis devices and highlights the potential of these technologies to improve patient outcomes. Traditional point-of-care urinalysis devices require the manual collection of urine, which may be unpleasant, cumbersome, or prone to errors. To overcome this issue, the toilet itself can be used as an alternative specimen collection and urinalysis device. This review then presents several smart toilet systems and incorporated sanitary devices for this purpose.",2023,biomarkers; biosensing; continuous monitoring; microfluidics; noninvasive health monitoring; urinalysis; urine metabolites,,"Sequeira-Antunes, B; Ferreira, HA"
Monitoring long-term chemical exposome by characterizing the hair metabolome using a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based suspect screening approach.,"Hair has recently emerged as a biospecimen for characterizing the long-term chemical exposome in biomonitoring investigations spanning several months, as chemical compounds circulating in the bloodstream accumulate in hair. Although there has been interest in using human hair as a biospecimen for exposome studies, it has yet to be widely adopted compared to blood and urine. Here, we applied a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based suspect screening strategy to characterize the long-term chemical exposome in human hair. Hair samples were collected from 70 subjects and cut into 3 cm segments, which were then mixed to prepare pooled samples. The pooled hair samples underwent a sample preparation procedure, and the hair extracts were further analyzed using an HRMS-based suspect screening approach. An in-house chemical suspect list containing 1227 chemical entries from National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals (Report) published by the U.S. CDC and the Exposome-Explorer 3.0 database developed by the WHO was subsequently used to screen and filter the suspect features against the HRMS dataset. Overall, we matched 587 suspect features in the HRMS dataset to 246 unique chemical formulas in the suspect list, and the structures of 167 chemicals were further identified through a fragmentation analysis. Among these, chemicals such as mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, methyl paraben, and 1-naphthol, which have been detected in the urine or blood for exposure assessment, were also identified in human hair. This suggests that hair reflects the accumulation of environmental compounds to which an individual is exposed. Exposure to exogenous chemicals may exert adverse effects on cognitive function, and we discovered 15 chemicals in human hair that may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This finding suggests that human hair may be a promising biospecimen for monitoring long-term exposure to multiple environmental chemicals and perturbations in endogenous chemicals in biomonitoring investigations.",2023,Biomonitoring; Chemical exposome; Hair; High-resolution mass spectrometry; Long-term; Suspect screening,"Humans; Exposome; Environmental Monitoring; Chromatography, Liquid; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolome","Chang, CW; Hsu, JY; Su, YH; Chen, YC; Hsiao, PZ; Liao, PC"
Insulin Resistance and Impaired Branched-Chain Amino Acid Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complicated and involves multiple contributing factors. Mounting evidence supports the concept that AD is an age-related metabolic neurodegenerative disease mediated in part by brain insulin resistance, and sharing similar metabolic dysfunctions and brain pathological characteristics that occur in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other insulin resistance disorders. Brain insulin signal pathway is a major regulator of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. In the past several years, impaired BCAA metabolism has been described in several insulin resistant states such as obesity, T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Disrupted BCAA metabolism leading to elevation in circulating BCAAs and related metabolites is an early metabolic phenotype of insulin resistance and correlated with future onset of T2DM. Brain is a major site for BCAA metabolism. BCAAs play pivotal roles in normal brain function, especially in signal transduction, nitrogen homeostasis, and neurotransmitter cycling. Evidence from animal models and patients support the involvement of BCAA dysmetabolism in neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and maple syrup urine disease. More recently, growing studies have revealed altered BCAA metabolism in AD, but the relationship between them is poorly understood. This review is focused on the recent findings regarding BCAA metabolism and its role in AD. Moreover, we will explore how impaired BCAA metabolism influences brain function and participates in the pathogenesis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; branched-chain amino acids; insulin resistance; metabolic neurodegenerative disease; metabolism,"Animals; Insulin Resistance; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Insulin; Amino Acids, Branched-Chain","Liu, R; Zhang, L; You, H"

"The Geroprotective Drug Candidate CMS121 Alleviates Diabetes, Liver Inflammation, and Renal Damage in db/db Leptin Receptor Deficient Mice.","db/db mice, which lack leptin receptors and exhibit hyperphagia, show disturbances in energy metabolism and are a model of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The geroneuroprotector drug candidate CMS121 has been shown to be effective in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and aging through the modulation of metabolism. Thus, the hypothesis was that CMS121 could protect db/db mice from metabolic defects and thereby reduce liver inflammation and kidney damage. The mice were treated with CMS121 in their diet for 6 months. No changes were observed in food and oxygen consumption, body mass, or locomotor activity compared to control db/db mice, but a 5% reduction in body weight was noted. Improved glucose tolerance and reduced HbA1c and insulin levels were also seen. Blood and liver triglycerides and free fatty acids decreased. Improved metabolism was supported by lower levels of fatty acid metabolites in the urine. Markers of liver inflammation, including NF-κB, IL-18, caspase 3, and C reactive protein, were lowered by the CMS121 treatment. Urine markers of kidney damage were improved, as evidenced by lower urinary levels of NGAL, clusterin, and albumin. Urine metabolomics studies provided further evidence for kidney protection. Mitochondrial protein markers were elevated in db/db mice, but CMS121 restored the renal levels of NDUFB8, UQCRC2, and VDAC. Overall, long-term CMS121 treatment alleviated metabolic imbalances, liver inflammation, and reduced markers of kidney damage. Thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential therapeutic use of CMS121 in treating metabolic disorders.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; geroneuroprotector; inflammation; kidney damage; metabolic disorders; obesity,"Mice; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Receptors, Leptin; Liver; Kidney; Hepatitis; Mice, Inbred Strains; Inflammation; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Leptin","Zahid, S; Dafre, AL; Currais, A; Yu, J; Schubert, D; Maher, P"
Mouse Models with SGLT2 Mutations: Toward Understanding the Role of SGLT2 beyond Glucose Reabsorption.,"The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) mainly carries out glucose reabsorption in the kidney.

Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors are attracting attention as a new therapeutic drug for diabetes, which is increasing worldwide. In fact, SGLT2 inhibitors not only suppress hyperglycemia but also reduce renal, heart, and cardiovascular diseases. However, whether long-term SGLT2 inhibition is completely harmless requires further investigation.

Copper Induces Cognitive Impairment in Mice via Modulation of Cuproptosis and CREB Signaling.,"It has been reported that disordered Cu metabolism is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, 4-week-old male mice were exposed to Cu by free-drinking water for three months. Then, the effects of Cu on cognitive functions in mice were tested by Morris water maze tests, and the potential mechanisms were investigated by the ELISA, immunochemistry, TUNEL, and Western blot tests. It was found that Cu exacerbates learning and memory impairment, and leads to Cu-overload in the brain and urine of mice. The results showed that Cu induces neuronal degeneration and oxidative damage, promotes the expression of apoptosis-related protein Bax, cuproptosis-related proteins FDX1 and DLAT and the proteotoxic stress marker HSP70, and decreases Fe-S cluster proteins. In addition, Cu affects the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic regulatory mechanisms through inhibiting the expression of PSD-95 and SYP. Cu also suppresses phosphorylation levels in CREB and decreases the expression of BDNF and TrkB in the mouse hippocampus. In conclusion, Cu might mediate cuproptosis, damage synaptic plasticity and inhibit the CREB/BDNF pathway to cause cognitive dysfunction in mice.",2023,CREB/BDNF; Cu; cognitive impairment; cuproptosis,Animals; Male; Mice; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cognitive Dysfunction; Copper; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Hippocampus; Signal Transduction; Apoptosis,"Zhang, Y; Zhou, Q; Lu, L; Su, Y; Shi, W; Zhang, H; Liu, R; Pu, Y; Yin, L"
Effects of electroacupuncture on urinary metabolome and microbiota in presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout mice.,"The treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a worldwide problem due to the unclear pathogenesis and lack of effective therapeutic targets. In recent years, metabolomic and gut microbiome changes in patients with AD have received increasing attention, and the microbiome-gut-brain (MGB) axis has been proposed as a new hypothesis for its etiology. Considering that electroacupuncture (EA) efficiently moderates cognitive deficits in AD and its mechanisms remain poorly understood, especially regarding its effects on the gut microbiota, we performed urinary metabolomic and microbial community profiling on EA-treated AD model mice, presenilin 1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, to observe the effect of EA treatment on the gut microbiota in AD and find the connection between affected gut microbiota and metabolites.",2022,Alzheimer’s disease; PS cDKO mice; electroacupuncture; gut microbiota; metabolomics,,"Gao, J; Zhou, N; Lu, M; Wang, Q; Zhao, C; Wang, J; Zhou, M; Xu, Y"

Dry Chemistry-Based Bipolar Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay Device for Point-of-Care Testing of Alzheimer-Associated Neuronal Thread Protein.,"In this study, we developed, for the first time, a novel dry chemistry-based bipolar electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay device for point-of-care testing (POCT) of Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP), where the ECL signals were automatically collected and analyzed after the sample and buffer solutions were manually added onto the immunosensor. The proposed immunoassay device contains an automatic ECL analyzer and a dry chemistry-based ECL immunosensor fabricated with a screen-printed fiber material-based chip and a three-dimensional (3D)-printed shell. Each pad of the fiber material-based chip was premodified with certain reagents for immunoreaction and then assembled to form the ECL immunosensor. The self-enhanced ECL of the Ru(II)-poly-l-lysine complex and the lateral flow fiber material-based chip make the addition of coreactants and repeated flushing unnecessary. Only the sample and buffer solutions are added to the ECL immunosensor, and the process of ECL detection can be completed in about 6 min using the proposed automatic ECL analyzer. Under optimized conditions, the linear detection range for AD7c-NTP was 1 to 10",2023,,Humans; Immunoassay; Alzheimer Disease; Biosensing Techniques; Reproducibility of Results; Immunologic Tests; Luminescent Measurements; Electrochemical Techniques; Nerve Tissue Proteins,"Liang, Y; Xue, K; Shi, Y; Zhan, T; Lai, W; Zhang, C"

Nicked tRNAs are stable reservoirs of tRNA halves in cells and biofluids.,"Nonvesicular extracellular RNAs (nv-exRNAs) constitute the majority of the extracellular RNAome, but little is known about their stability, function, and potential use as disease biomarkers. Herein, we measured the stability of several naked RNAs when incubated in human serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We identified extracellularly produced tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs) with half-lives of several hours in CSF. Contrary to widespread assumptions, these intrinsically stable small RNAs are full-length tRNAs containing broken phosphodiester bonds (i.e., nicked tRNAs). Standard molecular biology protocols, including phenol-based RNA extraction and heat, induce the artifactual denaturation of nicked tRNAs and the consequent in vitro production of tDRs. Broken bonds are roadblocks for reverse transcriptases, preventing amplification and/or sequencing of nicked tRNAs in their native state. To solve this, we performed enzymatic repair of nicked tRNAs purified under native conditions, harnessing the intrinsic activity of phage and bacterial tRNA repair systems. Enzymatic repair regenerated an RNase R-resistant tRNA-sized band in northern blot and enabled RT-PCR amplification of full-length tRNAs. We also separated nicked tRNAs from tDRs by chromatographic methods under native conditions, identifying nicked tRNAs inside stressed cells and in vesicle-depleted human biofluids. Dissociation of nicked tRNAs produces single-stranded tDRs that can be spontaneously taken up by human epithelial cells, positioning stable nv-exRNAs as potentially relevant players in intercellular communication pathways.",2023,RNA stability; extracellular RNA; liquid biopsies; tRF; tRNA halves,"Humans; RNA, Transfer; RNA; Bacteria; Epithelial Cells","Costa, B; Li Calzi, M; Castellano, M; Blanco, V; Cuevasanta, E; Litvan, I; Ivanov, P; Witwer, K; Cayota, A; Tosar, JP"

A review on comparative studies addressing exosome isolation methods from body fluids.,"Exosomes emerged as valuable sources of disease biomarkers and new therapeutic tools. However, extracellular vesicles isolation with exosome-like characteristics from certain biofluids is still challenging which can limit their potential use in clinical settings. While ultracentrifugation-based procedures are the gold standard for exosome isolation from cell cultures, no unique and standardized method for exosome isolation from distinct body fluids exists. The complexity, specific composition, and physical properties of each biofluid constitute a technical barrier to obtain reproducible and pure exosome preparations, demanding a detailed characterization of both exosome isolation and characterization methods. Moreover, some isolation procedures can affect downstream proteomic or RNA profiling analysis. This review compiles and discussed a set of comparative studies addressing distinct exosome isolation methods from human biofluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, serum, saliva, and urine, also focusing on body fluid specific challenges, physical properties, and other potential variation sources. This summarized information will facilitate the choice of exosome isolation methods, based on the type of biological samples available, and hopefully encourage the use of exosomes in translational and clinical research.",2023,Biofluids; Extracellular vesicles; Isolation methods,Humans; Exosomes; Proteomics; Ultracentrifugation; Body Fluids; Cell Culture Techniques,"Martins, TS; Vaz, M; Henriques, AG"
Environmental exposure of the general population to cadmium as a risk factor of the damage to the nervous system: A critical review of current data.,"Nowadays, more and more attention has been focused on the risk of the neurotoxic action of cadmium (Cd) under environmental exposure. Due to the growing incidence of nervous system diseases, including neurodegenerative changes, and suggested involvement of Cd in their aetiopathogenesis, this review aimed to discuss critically this element neurotoxicity. Attempts have been made to recognize at which concentrations in the blood and urine Cd may increase the risk of damage to the nervous system and compare it to the risk of injury of other organs and systems. The performed overview of the available literature shows that Cd may have an unfavourable impact on the human's nervous system at the concentration >0.8 μg Cd/L in the urine and >0.6 μg Cd/L in the blood. Because such concentrations are currently noted in the general population of industrialized countries, it can be concluded that environmental exposure to this xenobiotic may create a risk of damage to the nervous system and be involved in the aetiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as worsening cognitive and behavioural functions. The potential mechanism of Cd neurotoxicity consists in inducing oxidative stress, disrupting the activity of enzymes essential to the proper functioning of the nervous system and destroying the homoeostasis of bioelements in the brain. Thus, further studies are necessary to recognize accurately both the risk of nervous system damage in the general population due to environmental exposure to Cd and the mechanism of this action.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease; cadmium; chronic exposure; environmental exposure; neurodegeneration; neurodegenerative diseases; neurotoxicity,Humans; Cadmium; Environmental Exposure; Oxidative Stress; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Risk Factors,"Ruczaj, A; Brzóska, MM"
