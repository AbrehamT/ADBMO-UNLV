At-admission prediction of mortality and pulmonary embolism in an international cohort of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 using statistical and machine learning methods.,"By September 2022, more than 600 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported globally, resulting in over 6.5 million deaths. COVID-19 mortality risk estimators are often, however, developed with small unrepresentative samples and with methodological limitations. It is highly important to develop predictive tools for pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 patients as one of the most severe preventable complications of COVID-19. Early recognition can help provide life-saving targeted anti-coagulation therapy right at admission. Using a dataset of more than 800,000 COVID-19 patients from an international cohort, we propose a cost-sensitive gradient-boosted machine learning model that predicts occurrence of PE and death at admission. Logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and Shapley values were used to identify key predictors for PE and death. Our prediction model had a test AUROC of 75.9% and 74.2%, and sensitivities of 67.5% and 72.7% for PE and all-cause mortality respectively on a highly diverse and held-out test set. The PE prediction model was also evaluated on patients in UK and Spain separately with test results of 74.5% AUROC, 63.5% sensitivity and 78.9% AUROC, 95.7% sensitivity. Age, sex, region of admission, comorbidities (chronic cardiac and pulmonary disease, dementia, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, obesity, smoking), and symptoms (any, confusion, chest pain, fatigue, headache, fever, muscle or joint pain, shortness of breath) were the most important clinical predictors at admission. Age, overall presence of symptoms, shortness of breath, and hypertension were found to be key predictors for PE using our extreme gradient boosted model. This analysis based on the, until now, largest global dataset for this set of problems can inform hospital prioritisation policy and guide long term clinical research and decision-making for COVID-19 patients globally. Our machine learning model developed from an international cohort can serve to better regulate hospital risk prioritisation of at-risk patients.",2024,,"Humans; COVID-19; Pulmonary Embolism; Machine Learning; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Hospitalization; SARS-CoV-2; Cohort Studies; Spain; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Risk Factors; United Kingdom","Mesinovic, M; Wong, XC; Rajahram, GS; Citarella, BW; Peariasamy, KM; van Someren Greve, F; Olliaro, P; Merson, L; Clifton, L; Kartsonaki, C"

"Transforming Hypertension Diagnosis and Management in The Era of Artificial Intelligence: A 2023 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Workshop Report.","Hypertension is among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. The artificial intelligence (AI) field is advancing quickly, and there has been little discussion on how AI could be leveraged for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension. AI technologies, including machine learning tools, could alter the way we diagnose and manage hypertension, with potential impacts for improving individual and population health. The development of successful AI tools in public health and health care systems requires diverse types of expertise with collaborative relationships between clinicians, engineers, and data scientists. Unbiased data sources, management, and analyses remain a foundational challenge. From a diagnostic standpoint, machine learning tools may improve the measurement of blood pressure and be useful in the prediction of incident hypertension. To advance the management of hypertension, machine learning tools may be useful to find personalized treatments for patients using analytics to predict response to antihypertension medications and the risk for hypertension-related complications. However, there are real-world implementation challenges to using AI tools in hypertension. Herein, we summarize key findings from a diverse group of stakeholders who participated in a workshop held by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in March 2023. Workshop participants presented information on communication gaps between clinical medicine, data science, and engineering in health care; novel approaches to estimating BP, hypertension risk, and BP control; and real-world implementation challenges and issues.",2024,artificial intelligence; blood pressure; delivery of health care; hypertension; machine learning,,"Shimbo, D; Shah, RU; Abdalla, M; Agarwal, R; Ahmad, FS; Anaya, G; Attia, ZI; Bull, S; Chang, AR; Commodore-Mensah, Y; Ferdinand, K; Kawamoto, K; Khera, R; Leopold, J; Luo, J; Makhni, S; Mortazavi, BJ; Oh, YS; Savage, LC; Spatz, ES; Stergiou, G; Turakhia, MP; Whelton, PK; Yancy, CW; Iturriaga, E"

A pathologic study of Perivascular pTDP-43 Lin bodies in LATE-NC.,"TAR DNA-Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) pathological inclusions are a distinctive feature in dozens of neurodegenerative pathologies, including limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). Prior investigations identified vascular-associated TDP-43-positive micro-lesions, known as ""Lin bodies,"" located on or near the brain capillaries of some individuals with LATE-NC. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the accumulation of Lin bodies and glial cells in LATE-NC and the potential co-localization with ferritin, a protein associated with iron storage. Using multiplexed immunohistochemistry and digital pathology tools, we conducted pathological analyses to investigate the relationship between Lin bodies and glial markers (GFAP for astrocytes, IBA1 for microglia) and ferritin.

Verification of the effect of data-driven brain motion correction on PET imaging.,"Brain positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans are useful for identifying the cause of dementia by evaluating glucose metabolism in the brain with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose or Aβ deposition with F-18-florbetaben. However, since imaging time ranges from 10 to 30 minutes, movements during the examination might result in image artifacts, which interfere with diagnosis. To solve this problem, data-driven brain motion correction (DDBMC) techniques are capable of performing motion corrected reconstruction using highly accurate motion estimates with high temporal resolution.

Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy in the oldest old: a population-based study.,"Population-based cohort studies are essential for understanding the pathological basis of dementia in older populations. Previous studies have shown that limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC) increases with age, but there have been only a few studies, which have investigated this entity in a population-based setting. Here we studied the frequency of LATE-NC and its associations with other brain pathologies and cognition in a population aged ≥ 85 years. The population-based Vantaa 85+ study cohort includes all 601 individuals aged ≥ 85 years who were living in Vantaa, Finland in 1991. A neuropathological examination was performed on 304 subjects (50.5%) and LATE-NC staging was possible in 295 of those. Dementia status and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were defined in the baseline study and 3 follow-ups (1994-99). The LATE-NC stages were determined based on TDP-43 immunohistochemistry, according to recently updated recommendations. Arteriolosclerosis was digitally assessed by calculating the average sclerotic index of five random small arterioles in amygdala and hippocampal regions, and frontal white matter. The association of LATE-NC with arteriolosclerosis and previously determined neuropathological variables including Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (ADNC), Lewy-related pathology (LRP), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and cognitive variables were analysed by Fisher's exact test, linear and logistic regression (univariate and multivariate) models. LATE-NC was found in 189 of 295 subjects (64.1%). Stage 2 was the most common (28.5%) and stage 3 the second most common (12.9%), whereas stages 1a, 1b and 1c were less common (9.5%, 5.1% and 8.1%, respectively). Stages 1a (P < 0.01), 2 (P < 0.001) and 3 (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with dementia and lower MMSE scores. LATE-NC was associated with ADNC (P < 0.001), HS (P < 0.001), diffuse neocortical LRP (P < 0.002), and arteriolosclerosis in amygdala (P < 0.02). In most cases LATE-NC occurred in combination alongside other neuropathological changes. There were only six subjects with dementia who had LATE-NC without high levels of ADNC or LRP (2% of the cohort, 3% of the cases with dementia), and five of these had HS. In all multivariate models, LATE-NC was among the strongest independent predictors of dementia. When LATE-NC and ADNC were assessed in a multivariate model without other dementia-associated pathologies, the attributable risk was higher for LATE-NC than ADNC (24.2% vs. 18.6%). This population-based study provides evidence that LATE-NC is very common and one of the most significant determinants of dementia in the general late-life aged population.",2024,autopsy; mixed pathology; multivariate analysis; neurodegeneration; neuropathology; very old,,"Mikhailenko, E; Colangelo, K; Tuimala, J; Kero, M; Savola, S; Raunio, A; Kok, EH; Tanskanen, M; Mäkelä, M; Puttonen, H; Mäyränpää, MI; Kumar, D; Kaivola, K; Paetau, A; Tienari, PJ; Polvikoski, T; Myllykangas, L"

Modal Analysis of Cerebrovascular Effects for Digital Health Integration of Neurostimulation Therapies-A Review of Technology Concepts.,"Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is increasingly recognized for its potential to modulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and evoke cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which are crucial in conditions like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. This study explores the impact of tES on the neurovascular unit (NVU), employing a physiological modeling approach to simulate the vascular response to electric fields generated by tES. Utilizing the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for neuroelectrical activity, we demonstrate how tES can initiate vascular responses such as vasoconstriction followed by delayed vasodilation in cerebral arterioles, potentially modulated by a combination of local metabolic demands and autonomic regulation (pivotal locus coeruleus). Here, four distinct pathways within the NVU were modeled to reflect the complex interplay between synaptic activity, astrocytic influences, perivascular potassium dynamics, and smooth muscle cell responses. Modal analysis revealed characteristic dynamics of these pathways, suggesting that oscillatory tES may finely tune the vascular tone by modulating the stiffness and elasticity of blood vessel walls, possibly by also impacting endothelial glycocalyx function. The findings underscore the therapeutic potential vis-à-vis blood-brain barrier safety of tES in modulating neurovascular coupling and cognitive function needing the precise modulation of NVU dynamics. This technology review supports the human-in-the-loop integration of tES leveraging digital health technologies for the personalized management of cerebral blood flow, offering new avenues for treating vascular cognitive disorders. Future studies should aim to optimize tES parameters using computational modeling and validate these models in clinical settings, enhancing the understanding of tES in neurovascular health.",2024,digital health; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; precision medicine; transcranial electrical stimulation,,"Stefanski, M; Arora, Y; Cheung, M; Dutta, A"

Evaluating a mobile-based intervention to promote the mental health of informal dementia caregivers in Singapore: Study protocol for a pilot two-armed randomised controlled trial.,"Informal caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) often suffer adverse impacts on their mental health and require interventions for effective support. As they are often occupied with providing care, web-based interventions could be more convenient and efficient for them. However, there is currently a dearth of evidence-based mobile interventions to enhance the mental well-being of dementia caregivers locally, especially ones that are user-centered and culturally relevant. Hence, having designed an app based on feedback from local dementia caregivers, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of this mobile app in promoting the mental health of informal caregivers of PWD in Singapore.",2024,,Humans; Caregivers; Dementia; Singapore; Mental Health; Pilot Projects; Mobile Applications; Female; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Middle Aged,"Lee, YT; Yuan, Q; Zhang, Y; Samari, E; Goveas, R; Ng, LL; Subramaniam, M"

Sharing brain imaging data in the Open Science era: how and why?,"The sharing of human neuroimaging data has great potential to accelerate the development of imaging biomarkers in neurological and psychiatric disorders; however, major obstacles remain in terms of how and why to share data in the Open Science context. In this Health Policy by the European Cluster for Imaging Biomarkers, we outline the current main opportunities and challenges based on the results of an online survey disseminated among senior scientists in the field. Although the scientific community fully recognises the importance of data sharing, technical, legal, and motivational aspects often prevent active adoption. Therefore, we provide practical advice on how to overcome the technical barriers. We also call for a harmonised application of the General Data Protection Regulation across EU countries.

"User-centred design, validation and clinical testing of an anti-choking mug for people with Parkinson's disease.","Oropharyngeal dysphagia, or difficulty initiating swallowing, is a frequent problem in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and can lead to aspiration pneumonia. The efficacy of pharmacological options is limited. Postural strategies, such as a chin-down manoeuvre when drinking, have had some degree of success but may be difficult for people who have other limitations such as dementia or neck rigidity, to reproduce consistently. Using a user-centred design approach and a multidisciplinary team, we developed and tested an anti-choking mug for people with PD that helps angle the head in the optimum position for drinking. The design reflected anthropometric and ergonomic aspects of user needs with features including regulation of water flow rate and sip volume, an inner slope, a thickened handle and a wide base, which promoted a chin-down posture when used. Prototype testing using digital technology to compare neck flexion angles (the primary outcome), plus clinical outcomes assessed using standard tools (Swallowing Clinical Assessment Score in Parkinson's Disease (SCAS-PD) and Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts II and III), found significant improvements in a range of parameters related to efficient swallowing and safe drinking when using the anti-choking mug versus a sham mug.",2024,Anti-choking mug; Aspiration; Chin-down manoeuvre; Oropharyngeal dysphagia; Parkinson’s disease; User-centred design,Parkinson Disease; Humans; Male; Female; Deglutition Disorders; Aged; User-Centered Design; Deglutition; Middle Aged; Airway Obstruction; Posture,"Bhidayasiri, R; Chaisongkram, A; Anan, C; Phuenpathom, W"

Machine learning of dissection photographs and surface scanning for quantitative 3D neuropathology.,"We present open-source tools for three-dimensional (3D) analysis of photographs of dissected slices of human brains, which are routinely acquired in brain banks but seldom used for quantitative analysis. Our tools can: (1) 3D reconstruct a volume from the photographs and, optionally, a surface scan; and (2) produce a high-resolution 3D segmentation into 11 brain regions per hemisphere (22 in total), independently of the slice thickness. Our tools can be used as a substitute for ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which requires access to an MRI scanner, ex vivo scanning expertise, and considerable ﬁnancial resources. We tested our tools on synthetic and real data from two NIH Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers.

Co-registration of MALDI-MSI and histology demonstrates gangliosides co-localize with amyloid beta plaques in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by impaired cognitive function and behavioral alterations. While AD research historically centered around mis-folded proteins, advances in mass spectrometry techniques have triggered increased exploration of the AD lipidome with lipid dysregulation emerging as a critical player in AD pathogenesis. Gangliosides are a class of glycosphingolipids enriched within the central nervous system. Previous work has suggested a shift in a-series gangliosides from complex (GM1) to simple (GM2 and GM3) species may be related to the development of neurodegenerative disease. In addition, complex gangliosides with 20 carbon sphingosine chains have been shown to increase in the aging brain. In this study, we utilized matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to interrogate the in situ relationship of a-series gangliosides with either 18 or 20 carbon sphingosine chains (d18:1 or d20:1, respectively) in the post-mortem human AD brain. Here, we expanded upon previous literature and demonstrated a significant decrease in the GM1 d20:1 to GM1 d18:1 ratio in regions of the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex in AD relative to control brain tissue. Then, we demonstrated that the MALDI-MSI profile of GM3 co-localizes with histologically confirmed amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and found a significant increase in both GM1 and GM3 in proximity to Aβ plaques. Collectively, this study demonstrates a perturbation of the ganglioside profile in AD, and validates a pipeline for MALDI-MSI and classic histological staining in the same tissue sections. This demonstrates feasibility for integrating untargeted mass spectrometry imaging approaches into a digital pathology framework.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Digital pathology; Gangliosides; Lipids; MALDI-MSI,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gangliosides; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Plaque, Amyloid; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain; Male; Female","Ollen-Bittle, N; Pejhan, S; Pasternak, SH; Keene, CD; Zhang, Q; Whitehead, SN"
Photobiomodulation Therapy on Brain: Pioneering an Innovative Approach to Revolutionize Cognitive Dynamics.,"Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy on the brain employs red to near-infrared (NIR) light to treat various neurological and psychological disorders. The mechanism involves the activation of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby enhancing ATP synthesis. Additionally, light absorption by ion channels triggers the release of calcium ions, instigating the activation of transcription factors and subsequent gene expression. This cascade of events not only augments neuronal metabolic capacity but also orchestrates anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic responses, fostering neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. It shows promise for treating conditions like dementia, stroke, brain trauma, Parkinson's disease, and depression, even enhancing cognitive functions in healthy individuals and eliciting growing interest within the medical community. However, delivering sufficient light to the brain through transcranial approaches poses a significant challenge due to its limited penetration into tissue, prompting an exploration of alternative delivery methods such as intracranial and intranasal approaches. This comprehensive review aims to explore the mechanisms through which PBM exerts its effects on the brain and provide a summary of notable preclinical investigations and clinical trials conducted on various brain disorders, highlighting PBM's potential as a therapeutic modality capable of effectively impeding disease progression within the organism-a task often elusive with conventional pharmacological interventions.",2024,Parkinson’s disease; cognitive functions; cytochrome c oxidase; intracranial and intranasal delivery; photobiomodulation therapy; stroke; transcranial approach,Humans; Low-Level Light Therapy; Brain; Cognition; Animals,"Nairuz, T; Lee, JH"

A Novel Computerized Cognitive Test for the Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Its Association with Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Prone Brain Regions.,"During the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative changes can be identified by measuring volumetric loss in AD-prone brain regions on MRI. Cognitive assessments that are sensitive enough to measure the early brain-behavior manifestations of AD and that correlate with biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to identify and monitor individuals at risk for dementia. Weak sensitivity to early cognitive change has been a major limitation of traditional cognitive assessments. In this study, we focused on expanding our previous work by determining whether a digitized cognitive stress test, the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning, Brief Computerized Version (LASSI-BC) could differentiate between Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) groups. A second focus was to correlate LASSI-BC performance to volumetric reductions in AD-prone brain regions. Data was gathered from 111 older adults who were comprehensively evaluated and administered the LASSI-BC. Eighty-seven of these participants (51 CU; 36 aMCI) underwent MR imaging. The volumes of 12 AD-prone brain regions were related to LASSI-BC and other memory tests correcting for False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results indicated that, even after adjusting for initial learning ability, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) on the LASSI-BC differentiated between CU and aMCI groups. An optimal combination of frPSI and initial learning strength on the LASSI-BC yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.876 (76.1% sensitivity, 82.7% specificity). Further, frPSI on the LASSI-BC was associated with volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and posterior cingulate.",2023,Cortical Thickness; LASSI-L; MRI Volume; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Proactive Semantic Interference,,"Curiel Cid, RE; Zheng, DD; Kitaigorodsky, M; Adjouadi, M; Crocco, EA; Georgiou, M; Gonzalez-Jimenez, C; Ortega, A; Goryawala, M; Nagornaya, N; Pattany, P; Sfakianaki, E; Visser, U; Loewenstein, DA"

Value-based motivational strategies combined with technology to encourage a lifestyle that helps to prevent dementia.,"Lifestyles aimed at reducing dementia risk typically combine physical and cognitive training, nutritional adaptations, and, potentially, an augmentation in social interactions. Interventions at the population level are essential but should be complemented by individual efforts. For efficacy, lasting changes to an individual's lifestyle are needed, necessitating robust motivation and volition. Acting in accordance with one's values is assumed to be rewarding, leading to improved motivation and volition, and produces stable behaviour-outcome relationships. To this end, future preventive endeavours might first evaluate an individual's extant lifestyle, preferences, and values, including considerations of age-related changes to ensure these values remain a motivational source. Digital technology can support lifestyle goals and be targeted to support an individual's values. A digital platform could implement situation-specific, sensing-based feedback to alert users to a target situation (eg, opportunity for exercise) coupled with (smartphone-based) feedback on the extent of accomplished behavioural change to support individually set goals and facilitate their adjustment depending on whether these goals are achieved. This use of the motivational impetus of values, coupled with interpersonal techniques, such as motivational interviewing and SMART goal setting, in combination with sensor technology and just-in-time adaptive interventions, is assumed to hold high potential for dementia prevention.",2024,,Humans; Dementia; Motivation; Life Style,"Klöppel, S; Brill, E; Frisoni, GB; Aarsland, D; Klusmann-Weißkopf, V"

No playing around with robots? Ambivalent attitudes toward the use of Paro in elder care.,"This paper explores the ways in which health care professionals, family carers, and older persons expressed attitudes and opinions on using Paro, a social robot designed to stimulate patients with dementia. Thereafter, we critically evaluate existing prejudicial views toward Paro users to provide recommendations for its future use. Using an exploratory qualitative interview method, we recruited a total of 67 participants in Switzerland. They included 23 care professionals, 17 family carers, and 27 older persons. Data obtained were analyzed thematically. Study findings present general agreement that Paro is an appealing and beneficial social robot, but it is not a tool that everyone feels comfortable with. Because it is perceived as ""child play,"" it would be demeaning for competent adults to play with such things. Consequently, Paro is appropriate only for persons with dementia. These findings brought forth ethical concerns about deception, infantilization, and respecting older persons' dignity. The idea of who is an appropriate Paro user led to our discussions on predicting future Paro users. The meaning of using social robotics in nursing homes can be conditioned by a rigid interpretation of adulthood and playful behavior. To protect future selves when one is living with dementia from prejudices, it may be useful for older persons and their loved ones to plan their future care situations to ensure that they are treated in accordance with their delineated decisions.",2024,Homo Ludens; Paro; dignity; elder care; future care planning; nursing homes; qualitative study; social robots,,"Wangmo, T; Duong, V; Felber, NA; Tian, YJA; Mihailov, E"
Digital outcome measures from smartwatch data relate to non-motor features of Parkinson's disease.,"Monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) has seen substantial improvement over recent years as digital sensors enable a passive and continuous collection of information in the home environment. However, the primary focus of this work has been motor symptoms, with little focus on the non-motor aspects of the disease. To address this, we combined longitudinal clinical non-motor assessment data and digital multi-sensor data from the Verily Study Watch for 149 participants from the Parkinson's Progression Monitoring Initiative (PPMI) cohort with a diagnosis of PD. We show that digitally collected physical activity and sleep measures significantly relate to clinical non-motor assessments of cognitive, autonomic, and daily living impairment. However, the poor predictive performance we observed, highlights the need for better targeted digital outcome measures to enable monitoring of non-motor symptoms.",2024,,,"Schalkamp, AK; Harrison, NA; Peall, KJ; Sandor, C"

Exploratory study to evaluate the acceptability of a wearable accelerometer to assess motor progression in motor neuron disease.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive condition traditionally assessed using a questionnaire to evaluate physical function, the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R). Its use can be associated with poor sensitivity in detecting subtle changes over time and there is an urgent need for more sensitive and specific outcome measures. The ActiGraph GT9X is a wearable device containing multiple sensors that can be used to provide metrics that represent physical activity. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the initial suitability and acceptability of limb-worn wearable devices to group of people with MND in Scotland. A secondary aim was to explore the preliminary associations between the accelerometer sensor data within the ActiGraph GT9X and established measures of physical function. 10 participants with MND completed a 12-week schedule of assessments including fortnightly study visits, both in-person and over videoconferencing software. Participants wore the device on their right wrist and right ankle for a series of movements, during a 6-min walking test and for a period of 24-h wear, including overnight. Participants also completed an ALSFRS-R and questionnaires on their experience with the devices. 80% of the participants found wearing these devices to be a positive experience and no one reported interference with daily living or added burden. However, 30% of the participants experienced technical issues with their devices. Data from the wearable devices correlated with established measures of physical function.",2024,Accelerometer; Digital health; Motor neuron disease; Wearable devices,,"Beswick, E; Christides, A; Symonds, A; Johnson, M; Fawcett, T; Newton, J; Lyle, D; Weaver, C; Chandran, S; Pal, S"
A Pilot Study to Improve Cognitive Performance and Pupil Responses in Mild Cognitive Impaired Patients Using Gaze-Controlled Gaming.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may progress to severe forms of dementia, so therapy is needed to maintain cognitive abilities. The neural circuitry for oculomotor control is closely linked to that which controls cognitive behavior. In this study, we tested whether training the oculomotor system with gaze-controlled video games could improve cognitive behavior in MCI patients. Patients played a simple game for 2-3 weeks while a control group played the same game using a mouse. Cognitive improvement was assessed using the MoCA screening test and CANTAB. We also measured eye pupil and vergence responses in an oddball paradigm. The results showed an increased score on the MoCA test specifically for the visuospatial domain and on the Rapid Visual Information Processing test of the CANTAB battery. Pupil responses also increased to target stimuli. Patients in the control group did not show significant improvements. This pilot study provides evidence for the potential cognitive benefits of gaze-controlled gaming in MCI patients.",2024,MCI; attention; digital treatment; pupil; visual oddball,,"Solé Puig, M; Bustos Valenzuela, P; Romeo, A; Supèr, H"

Exploring the Role of Guanylate-Binding Protein-2 in Activated Microglia-Mediated Neuroinflammation and Neuronal Damage.,"Neuron damage by microglia, which act as macrophage cells in the brain, can result in various brain diseases. However, the function of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory microglia in the neurons remains controversial. Guanylate-binding protein-2 (GBP2) is expressed and activated in the microglia in the early phase of the inflammatory response and plays an important role in controlling immune responses. In this study, we evaluated whether GBP2 initially reduces the immune response induced by microglia, and whether microglia induce pro-inflammatory functions in neurons via GBP2 expression. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia, we assessed the expression of GBP2 and how it affects neurons via activated microglia.

Beyond Frequency Bands: Complementary-Ensemble-Empirical-Mode-Decomposition-Enhanced Microstate Sequence Non-Randomness Analysis for Aiding Diagnosis and Cognitive Prediction of Dementia.,"Exploring the spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for interpreting dementia and related cognitive decline. Spatiotemporal patterns of EEG can be described through microstate analysis, which provides a discrete approximation of the continuous electric field patterns generated by the brain cortex. Here, we propose a novel microstate spatiotemporal dynamic indicator, termed the microstate sequence non-randomness index (MSNRI). The essence of the method lies in initially generating a sequence of microstate transition patterns through state space compression of EEG data using microstate analysis. Following this, we assess the non-randomness of these microstate patterns using information-based similarity analysis. The results suggest that this MSNRI metric is a potential marker for distinguishing between health control (HC) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (HC vs. FTD: 6.958 vs. 5.756, ",2024,dementia; electroencephalogram; information-based similarity; microstate transitions; non-randomness,,"Wan, W; Gu, Z; Peng, CK; Cui, X"
Evaluation of the Parkinson's Remote Interactive Monitoring System in a Clinical Setting: Usability Study.,"The fastest-growing neurological disorder is Parkinson disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 10 million people worldwide. PD is typically treated with levodopa, an oral pill taken to increase dopamine levels, and other dopaminergic agonists. As the disease advances, the efficacy of the drug diminishes, necessitating adjustments in treatment dosage according to the patient's symptoms and disease progression. Therefore, remote monitoring systems that can provide more detailed and accurate information on a patient's condition regularly are a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to manage their medication. The Parkinson's Remote Interactive Monitoring System (PRIMS), developed by PragmaClin Research Inc, was designed on the premise that it will be an easy-to-use digital system that can accurately capture motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD remotely.",2024,Parkinson disease; System Usability Scale; mobile phone; motor examination; movement disorders; remote monitoring; thematic analysis; usability,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; User-Computer Interface; Monitoring, Physiologic","Bridges, B; Taylor, J; Weber, JT"
Actual Clinical Practice Assessment: A Rapid and Easy-to-Use Tool for Evaluating Cognitive Decline Equivalent to Dementia.,"Background Screening tests reveal the early signs of cognitive decline, enabling better self-care and preparation for the future. We developed and evaluated the accuracy of a rapid (20 s) and easy-to-use tool called ONSEI, assessing the cognitive decline equivalent to dementia in actual clinical practice by correlating clinical diagnoses with the ONSEI classification. Methods In this retrospective observational study, data were collected from individuals who visited three neurosurgical clinics in neighboring prefectures of Tokyo, Japan. ONSEI analysis was performed using a smartphone or tablet. The tool adopts a machine-learning algorithm using the speaker's age, time-orientation task score, and acoustic features of spoken responses to that task. Significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated by Fisher's exact test. Results The overall classification accuracy of ONSEI was 98.1% (p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 97.3% (p<0.001) and 98.5% (p<0.001), respectively. The proportion of correct classifications was consistent across different age groups. Conclusion ONSEI showed high classification accuracy for dementia in cognitively normal individuals in actual clinical practice, regardless of the facility at which the tests were conducted or the age of the participants. Thus, ONSEI can be useful for dementia screening and self-care.",2024,automated classification; dementia; digital cognitive assessment; machine learning; speech features,,"Asano, T; Yasuda, A; Kinoshita, S; Nomoto, J; Kato, T; Suzuki, C; Suzuki, H; Kinoshita, T; Shigeta, M; Homma, A"

Investigating the brain's neurochemical profile at midlife in relation to dementia risk factors.,"Changes in the brain's physiology in Alzheimer's disease are thought to occur early in the disease's trajectory. In this study our aim was to investigate the brain's neurochemical profile in a midlife cohort in relation to risk factors for future dementia using single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Participants in the multi-site PREVENT-Dementia study (age range 40-59 year old) underwent 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy with the spectroscopy voxel placed in the posterior cingulate/precuneus region. Using LCModel, we quantified the absolute concentrations of myo-inositol, total N-acetylaspartate, total creatine, choline, glutathione and glutamate-glutamine for 406 participants (mean age 51.1; 65.3% female). Underlying partial volume effects were accounted for by applying a correction for the presence of cerebrospinal fluid in the magnetic resonance spectroscopy voxel. We investigated how metabolite concentrations related to apolipoprotein ɛ4 genotype, dementia family history, a risk score (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Incidence of Dementia -CAIDE) for future dementia including non-modifiable and potentially-modifiable factors and dietary patterns (adherence to Mediterranean diet). Dementia family history was associated with decreased total N-acetylaspartate and no differences were found between apolipoprotein ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers. A higher Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia score related to higher myo-inositol, choline, total creatine and glutamate-glutamine, an effect which was mainly driven by older age and a higher body mass index. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower choline, myo-inositol and total creatine; these effects did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. The observed associations suggest that at midlife the brain demonstrates subtle neurochemical changes in relation to both inherited and potentially modifiable risk factors for future dementia.",2024,APOE4; Alzheimer’s disease; MRS; brain metabolism; preclinical dementia,,"Dounavi, ME; McKiernan, E; Langsen, M; Gregory, S; Muniz-Terrera, G; Prats-Sedano, MA; Mada, MO; Williams, GB; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Mackay, C; Koychev, I; Malhotra, P; Ritchie, K; Ritchie, CW; Su, L; Waldman, AD; O' Brien, JT"

Pseudostellaria heterophylla polysaccharide mitigates Alzheimer's-like pathology via regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in 5 × FAD mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by neuroinflammation, for which gut dysbiosis may be implicated. Our previous study showed that treatment with Pseudostellaria heterophylla aqueous extract and one of its cyclopeptides, heterophyllin B, attenuate memory deficits via immunomodulation and neurite regeneration. However, whether Pseudostellaria heterophylla polysaccharide (PH-PS) exerts neuroprotective effects against AD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The infrared spectrum, molecular weight, and carbohydrate composition of the PH-PS were determined. The results showed that PH-PS (Mw 8.771 kDa) was composed of glucose (57.78 %), galactose (41.52 %), and arabinose (0.70 %). PH-PS treatment ameliorated learning and spatial memory deficits, reduced amyloid β build-up, and suppressed reactive glia and astrocytes in 5 × FAD mice. 16S rRNA sequencing further showed that PH-PS remodelled the intestinal flora composition by promoting probiotic microbiota, such as Lactobacillus, Muribaculum, Monoglobus, and [Eubacterium]_siraeum_group, and suppressing inflammation-related UCG-009 and Blautia. Additionally, PH-PS restored intestinal barrier function; ameliorated peripheral inflammation by reducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, thereby converting M1 microglia and A1 astrocyte toward beneficial M2 and A2 phenotypes; and contributed to Aβ plaques clearance by upregulation of insulin degradation enzyme and neprilysin. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PH-PS may prevent the progression of AD via modulation of the gut microbiota and regulation of glial polarisation, which could provide evidence to design a potential diet therapy for preventing or curing AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive impairment; Microbiota-gut-brain axis; Pseudostellaria heterophylla polysaccharide,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Polysaccharides; Mice; Brain; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Models, Animal; Juglandaceae; Male; Neuroprotective Agents","He, C; Jiang, J; Liu, J; Zhou, L; Ge, Y; Yang, Z"

Modern scores for traditional tests - Review of the diagnostic potential of scores derived from word list learning tests in mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's Disease.,"Episodic memory impairment is one of the early hallmarks in Alzheimer's Disease. In the clinical diagnosis and research, episodic memory impairment is typically assessed using word lists that are repeatedly presented to and recalled by the participant across several trials. Until recently, total learning scores, which consist of the total number of words that are recalled by participants, were almost exclusively used for diagnostic purposes. The present review aims at summarizing evidence on additional scores derived from the learning trials which have recently been investigated more frequently regarding their diagnostic potential. These scores reflect item acquisition, error frequencies, strategy use, intertrial fluctuations, and recall consistency. Evidence was summarized regarding the effects of clinical status on these scores. Preclinical, mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's Disease stages were associated with a pattern of reduced item acquisition, more errors, less strategy use, and reduced access of items, indicating slowed and erroneous encoding.

Vocal expression of emotions discriminates dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the two most common neurodegenerative dementias, both exhibit altered emotional processing. However, how vocal emotional expressions alter in and differ between DLB and AD remains uninvestigated. We collected voice data during story reading from 152 older adults comprising DLB, AD, and cognitively unimpaired (CU) groups and compared their emotional prosody in terms of valence and arousal dimensions. Compared with matched AD and CU participants, DLB patients showed reduced overall emotional expressiveness, as well as lower valence (more negative) and lower arousal (calmer), the extent of which was associated with cognitive impairment and insular atrophy. Classification models using vocal features discriminated DLB from AD and CU with an AUC of 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. Our findings may aid in discriminating DLB patients from AD and CU individuals, serving as a surrogate marker for clinical and neuropathological changes in DLB.",2024,Lewy body dementia; affective prosody; arousal; digital health; emotional processing; machine learning; valence,,"Kobayashi, M; Yamada, Y; Shinkawa, K; Nemoto, M; Ota, M; Nemoto, K; Arai, T"

APOE4 homozygozity represents a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's disease.,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of APOE4 homozygosity on Alzheimer's disease (AD) by examining its clinical, pathological and biomarker changes to see whether APOE4 homozygotes constitute a distinct, genetically determined form of AD. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and five large cohorts with AD biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis included 3,297 individuals for the pathological study and 10,039 for the clinical study. Findings revealed that almost all APOE4 homozygotes exhibited AD pathology and had significantly higher levels of AD biomarkers from age 55 compared to APOE3 homozygotes. By age 65, nearly all had abnormal amyloid levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and 75% had positive amyloid scans, with the prevalence of these markers increasing with age, indicating near-full penetrance of AD biology in APOE4 homozygotes. The age of symptom onset was earlier in APOE4 homozygotes at 65.1, with a narrower 95% prediction interval than APOE3 homozygotes.

Exploring inertial sensor-based balance biomarkers for early detection of mild cognitive impairment.,"Dementia is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive abilities, and diagnosing its early stages Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is difficult since it is a transitory state that is different from total cognitive collapse. Recent clinical research studies have identified that balance impairments can be a significant indicator for predicting dementia in older adults. Accordingly, the current research focuses on finding innovative postural balance-based digital biomarkers by using wearable inertial sensors and pre-screening of MCI in home settings using machine learning techniques. For this research, sixty subjects (30 cognitively normal and 30 MCI) with waist-mounted inertial sensor performed balance tasks in four different standing postures: eyes-open, eyes-closed, right-leg-lift, and left-leg-lift. The significant balance biomarkers for MCI identification are discovered by our research, demonstrating specific characteristics in each of these four states. A robust feature selection approach is ensured by the multi-step methodology that combines the strengths of Filter techniques, Wrapper methods, and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) technique. The proposed balance biomarkers have the potential to detect MCI (with 75.8% accuracy), as evidenced by the results of machine learning algorithms for classification. This work adds to the growing body of literature targeted at enhancing understanding and proactive management of cognitive loss in older populations and lays the groundwork for future research efforts aimed at refining digital biomarkers, validating findings, and exploring longitudinal perspectives.",2024,,"Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aged; Postural Balance; Male; Female; Biomarkers; Machine Learning; Early Diagnosis; Wearable Electronic Devices; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over","Jamshed, M; Shahzad, A; Riaz, F; Kim, K"

Postoperative Delirium and the Older Adult: Untangling the Confusion.,"Postoperative delirium is one of the most prevalent postoperative complications, affecting mostly older adults. Its incidence is expected to rise because of surgical advances, shifting demographics, and increased life expectancy. Although an acute alteration in brain function, postoperative delirium is associated with adverse outcomes, including progressive cognitive decline and dementia, that place significant burdens on patients' lives and healthcare systems. This has prompted efforts to understand the mechanisms of postoperative delirium to provide effective prevention and treatment. There are multiple mechanisms involved in the etiology of postoperative delirium that share similarities with the physiological changes associated with the aging brain. In addition, older patients often have multiple comorbidities including increased cognitive impairment that is also implicated in the genesis of delirium. These tangled connections pinpointed a shift toward creation of a holistic model of the pathophysiology of postoperative delirium. Scientific advancements integrating clinical risk factors, possible postoperative delirium biomarkers, genetic features, digital platforms, and other biotechnical and information technological innovations, will become available in the near future. Advances in artificial intelligence, for example, will aggregate cognitive testing platforms with patient-specific postoperative delirium risk stratification studies, panels of serum and cerebrospinal fluid molecules, electroencephalogram signatures, and gut microbiome features, along with the integration of novel polygenetic variants of sleep and cognition. These advances will allow for the enrollment of high-risk patients into prevention programs and help uncover new pharmacologic targets.",2024,,"Humans; Postoperative Complications; Aged; Delirium; Risk Factors; Confusion; Aged, 80 and over; Cognitive Dysfunction; Emergence Delirium","Thedim, M; Vacas, S"

Cytoarchitectonic gradients of laminar degeneration in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.,"Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a clinical syndrome primarily caused by either tau (bvFTD-tau) or TDP-43 (bvFTD-TDP) proteinopathies. We previously found lower cortical layers and dorsolateral regions accumulate greater tau than TDP-43 pathology; however, patterns of laminar neurodegeneration across diverse cytoarchitecture in bvFTD is understudied. We hypothesized that bvFTD-tau and bvFTD-TDP have distinct laminar distributions of pyramidal neurodegeneration along cortical gradients, a topologic order of cytoarchitectonic subregions based on increasing pyramidal density and laminar differentiation. Here, we tested this hypothesis in a frontal cortical gradient consisting of five cytoarchitectonic types (i.e., periallocortex, agranular mesocortex, dysgranular mesocortex, eulaminate-I isocortex, eulaminate-II isocortex) spanning anterior cingulate, paracingulate, orbitofrontal, and mid-frontal gyri in bvFTD-tau (n=27), bvFTD-TDP (n=47), and healthy controls (HC; n=32). We immunostained all tissue for total neurons (NeuN; neuronal-nuclear protein) and pyramidal neurons (SMI32; non-phosphorylated neurofilament) and digitally quantified NeuN-immunoreactivity (ir) and SMI32-ir in supragranular II-III, infragranular V-VI, and all I-VI layers in each cytoarchitectonic type. We used linear mixed-effects models adjusted for demographic and biologic variables to compare SMI32-ir between groups and examine relationships with the cortical gradient, long-range pathways, and clinical symptoms. We found regional and laminar distributions of SMI32-ir expected for HC, validating our measures within the cortical gradient framework. While SMI32-ir loss was not related to the cortical gradient in bvFTD-TDP, SMI32-ir progressively decreased along the cortical gradient of bvFTD-tau and included greater SMI32-ir loss in supragranular eulaminate-II isocortex in bvFTD-tau vs bvFTD-TDP ( ",2024,,,"Ohm, DT; Xie, SX; Capp, N; Arezoumandan, S; Cousins, KAQ; Rascovsky, K; Wolk, DA; Van Deerlin, VM; Lee, EB; McMillan, CT; Irwin, DJ"

Digital quantification of the MMSE interlocking pentagon areas: a three-stage algorithm.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a widely employed screening tool for the severity of cognitive impairment. Among the MMSE items, the pentagon copying test (PCT) requires participants to accurately replicate a sample of two interlocking pentagons. While the PCT is traditionally scored on a binary scale, there have been limited developments of granular scoring scale to assess task performance. In this paper, we present a novel three-stage algorithm, called Quantification of Interlocking Pentagons (QIP) which quantifies PCT performance by computing the areas of individual pentagons and their intersection areas, and a balance ratio between the areas of the two individual pentagons. The three stages of the QIP algorithm include: (1) detection of line segments, (2) unraveling of the interlocking pentagons, and (3) quantification of areas. A set of 497 PCTs from 84 participants including their baseline and follow-up PCTs from the Rush Memory and Aging Project was selected blinded about their cognitive and clinical status. Analysis of the quantified data revealed a significant inverse relationship between age and balance ratio (beta = - 0.49, p = 0.0033), indicating that older age was associated with a smaller balance ratio. In addition, balance ratio was associated with perceptual speed (r = 0.71, p = 0.0135), vascular risk factors (beta = - 3.96, p = 0.0269), and medical conditions (beta = - 2.78, p = 0.0389).

Unveiling New Strategies Facilitating the Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging for the Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a global impact. The past few decades have witnessed significant strides in comprehending the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and developing diagnostic methodologies for AD, such as neuroimaging approaches. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have revolutionized the field by providing valuable insights into the structural and functional alterations in the brains of individuals with AD. These imaging modalities enable the detection of early biomarkers such as amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles, facilitating early and precise diagnosis. Furthermore, the emerging technologies encompassing blood-based biomarkers and neurochemical profiling exhibit promising results in the identification of specific molecular signatures for AD. The integration of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence has enhanced the predictive capacity of these diagnostic tools when analyzing complex datasets. In this review article, we will highlight not only some of the most used diagnostic imaging approaches in neurodegeneration research but focus much more on new tools like artificial intelligence, emphasizing their application in the realm of AD.

PROCare4Life was highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is acknowledged in the lessons learned.

Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD. Our new smartphone test, TapTalk, combines analysis of hand and speech-like movements to detect AD risk. This study aims to [1] determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately predict preclinical AD [2], determine usability, reliability, and validity of TapTalk in cognitively asymptomatic older adults and [3], prospectively validate TapTalk in older adults who have cognitive symptoms against cognitive tests and clinical diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Dementia; Diadochokinesis; Digital biomarker; Finger-tapping; Kinematics; Multimodal; TAS Test; TapTalk,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Alty, J; Goldberg, LR; Roccati, E; Lawler, K; Bai, Q; Huang, G; Bindoff, AD; Li, R; Wang, X; St George, RJ; Rudd, K; Bartlett, L; Collins, JM; Aiyede, M; Fernando, N; Bhagwat, A; Giffard, J; Salmon, K; McDonald, S; King, AE; Vickers, JC"
Insulin Signaling Differentially Regulates the Trafficking of Insulin and Amyloid Beta Peptides at the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is instrumental in clearing toxic metabolites from the brain, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and in delivering essential nutrients to the brain, like insulin. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, increased Aβ levels are paralleled by decreased insulin levels, which are accompanied by insulin signaling deficits at the BBB. Thus, we investigated the impact of insulin-like growth factor and insulin receptor (IGF1R and IR) signaling on Aβ and insulin trafficking at the BBB.

Disease and brain region specific immune response profiles in neurodegenerative diseases with pure and mixed protein pathologies.,"The disease-specific accumulation of pathological proteins has long been the major focus of research in neurodegenerative diseases (ND), including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (RD), but the recent identification of a multitude of genetic risk factors for ND in immune-associated genes highlights the importance of immune processes in disease pathogenesis and progression. Studies in animal models have characterized the local immune response to disease-specific proteins in AD and ADRD, but due to the complexity of disease processes and the co-existence of multiple protein pathologies in human donor brains, the precise role of immune processes in ND is far from understood. To better characterize the interplay between different extracellular and intracellular protein pathologies and the brain's intrinsic immune system in ND, we set out to comprehensively profile the local immune response in postmortem brain samples of individuals with ""pure"" beta-Amyloid and tau pathology (AD), ""pure"" α-Synuclein pathology in Lewy body diseases (LBD), as well as cases with Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes (ADNC) and Lewy body pathology (MIX). Combining immunohistochemical profiling of microglia and digital image analysis, along with deep immunophenotyping using gene expression profiling on the NanoString nCounter® platform and digital spatial profiling on the NanoString GeoMx® platform we identified a robust immune activation signature in AD brain samples. This signature is maintained in persons with mixed pathologies, irrespective of co-existence of AD pathology and Lewy body (LB) pathology, while LBD brain samples with ""pure"" LB pathology exhibit an attenuated and distinct immune signature. Our studies highlight disease- and brain region-specific immune response profiles to intracellular and extracellular protein pathologies and further underscore the complexity of neuroimmune interactions in ND.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta plaques; Deep immunophenotyping; Digital spatial profiling; Microglia; Mixed pathologies; Protein pathology,Animals; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; tau Proteins; alpha-Synuclein; Lewy Body Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain,"Bathe, T; Hery, GP; Villareal, JAB; Phillips, JL; Cohen, EM; Sharma, RV; Tsering, W; Prokop, S"

Effect of digital technology interventions for cognitive function improvement in mild cognitive impairment and dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The development and commercialization of digital therapeutics are increasing. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of digital technology interventions on cognitive function, thereby providing evidence for the development and practical application of interventions to manage cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. Randomized controlled trials on digital technology interventions published until April 2023 were searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases without a period limit. Articles that identified the effects of digital technology interventions on cognitive function improvement in dementia and mild cognitive impairment were integrated and analyzed. RevMan software 5.4 was used for quality assessment and meta-analysis. Twelve out of 708 studies were included in the review and meta-analysis. Digital technology interventions had significant effects on global cognitive function (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.57; p = 0.02; I² = 60%). In addition, these interventions had significant effects on neuropsychological characteristics, including attention (SMD = 1.17; 95% CI = 0.36-1.97; p = 0.004; I² = 84%), visuospatial perception (SMD = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.19-1.17; p = 0.006; I² = 57%), and memory (SMD = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.19-0.71; p = 0.0007; I² = 22%).

Transport digitalisation: Navigating futures of hypercognitive disablement.,"People living with cognitive impairments face new forms of disablement in the context of transport digitalisation, an issue recently catalysed by controversies regarding rail ticket office closures. Transport can dramatically impact the lives of people diagnosed with dementia, who often find their mobility suddenly and dramatically impaired. Unfortunately, sociological analysis of cognitive disability has traditionally been undermined by under-theorisation. One solution can be found in classic bioethical work on hypercognitivism-the veneration of cognitive acuity-and its disabling consequences. A hypercognitive approach can nurture an attentiveness to the specificities of digital disablement. Here, disability does not emerge from digitalisation inherently, but is instead intensified by the implementation of digitalisation in line with value commitments. A more robust sociology of cognitive disability could better represent the interests of people with cognitive impairments and resist the new forms of disability that current digitalisation risks spreading.",2024,ageing; cognition; dementia; justice; mobility,,"Fletcher, JR"

Intelligent decision support systems for dementia care: A scoping review.,"In the context of dementia care, Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered clinical decision support systems have the potential to enhance diagnosis and management. However, the scope and challenges of applying these technologies remain unclear. This scoping review aims to investigate the current state of AI applications in the development of intelligent decision support systems for dementia care. We conducted a comprehensive scoping review of empirical studies that utilised AI-powered clinical decision support systems in dementia care. The results indicate that AI applications in dementia care primarily focus on diagnosis, with limited attention to other aspects outlined in the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017-2025 (GAPD). A trifecta of challenges, encompassing data availability, cost considerations, and AI algorithm performance, emerges as noteworthy barriers in adoption of AI applications in dementia care. To address these challenges and enhance AI reliability, we propose a novel approach: a digital twin-based patient journey model. Future research should address identified gaps in GAPD action areas, navigate data-related obstacles, and explore the implementation of digital twins. Additionally, it is imperative to emphasize that addressing trust and combating the stigma associated with AI in healthcare should be a central focus of future research directions.",2024,Alzheimer; Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Dementia,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Reproducibility of Results; Algorithms; Dementia; Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases,"Andargoli, AE; Ulapane, N; Nguyen, TA; Shuakat, N; Zelcer, J; Wickramasinghe, N"

Evaluation of the relationship between FDG-PET hypometabolism and retinal layer thickness in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to assess the correlation between OCT and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) which shows high diagnostic agreement with findings from postmortem histopathology-the gold standard method. Patients who were diagnosed with AD-related dementia were selected for the study. Patients with a mini mental test (MMT) score between 18 and 23 were included in the study (n = 31). Volunteers with MMT ≥ 28 and no cognitive impairment were included in the study as the control group (n = 31). OCT imaging was performed in the patient and control groups after detailed ophthalmological examinations including visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements. Brain glucose metabolism measurement was performed using 18 F-FDG PET/computed tomography. When adjusted for age and sex, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) thickness showed a significant difference between groups and the RNFL thickness in the superior temporal and superior nasal quadrants in AD-related mild dementia group showed a significant difference (p < 0.05). Furthermore, only the RNFL thickness in the inferior nasal quadrant of the right eye showed a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.016). It is thought that OCT is a promising imaging method in the elderly population due to its low-cost, non-invasive and easily applicability, and therefore, it may contribute in the future as a tool in the periodic follow-up of patients diagnosed with AD.",2024,Cognitive functions; Dementia; Positron emission tomography; Retinal neurodegeneration,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Retina; Positron-Emission Tomography; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Radiopharmaceuticals; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography","Duman Sastim, D; Elboga, G; Elboga, U; Gungor, K"
Evaluating Technicians' Workload and Performance in Diagnosis for Corrective Maintenance.,"The advancement in digital technology is transforming the world. It enables smart product-service systems that improve productivity by changing tasks, processes, and the ways we work. There are great opportunities in maintenance because many tasks require physical and cognitive work, but are still carried out manually. However, the interaction between a human and a smart system is inevitable, since not all tasks in maintenance can be fully automated. Therefore, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment to investigate the impact on technicians' workload and performance due to the introduction of smart technology. Especially, we focused on the effects of different diagnosis support systems on technicians during maintenance activity. We experimented with a model that replicates the key components of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine with a proximity sensor, a component that requires frequent maintenance. Forty-five participants were evenly assigned to three groups: a group that used a Fault-Tree diagnosis support system (FTd-system), a group that used an artificial intelligence diagnosis support system (AId-system), and a group that used neither of the diagnosis support systems. The results show that the group that used the FTd-system completed the task 15% faster than the group that used the AId-system. There was no significant difference in the workload between groups. Further analysis using the NGOMSL model implied that the difference in time to complete was probably due to the difference in system interfaces. In summary, the experimental results and further analysis imply that adopting the new diagnosis support system may improve maintenance productivity by reducing the number of diagnosis attempts without burdening technicians with new workloads. Estimates indicate that the maintenance time and the cognitive load can be reduced by 8.4 s and 15% if only two options are shown in the user interface.",2024,diagnosis support system; human–smart system interface; maintenance,Humans; Workload; Artificial Intelligence; Frontotemporal Dementia; Technology; User-Computer Interface,"Shin, H; Rothrock, L; Prabhu, V"
Plasma miR-203a-3p as a Novel Predictor of Dementia in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"The early detection of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease is important for providing drug therapy and non-pharmacological management. The circulating microRNAs present in plasma are promising biomarkers of PD with dementia (PDD) due to their critical roles in synaptic plasticity and the regulation of neurodegeneration-associated proteins. In this study, we aimed to identify plasma microRNAs that may differentiate PD with or without cognitive impairment. Global microRNA expression was obtained from a discovery set of 123 participants who were divided into four groups, namely normal controls (HC), PD with no dementia (PDND), PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and PDD, using next-generation sequencing. The BOLD selector was used for microRNA candidate selection. Six miRNAs, namely miR-203a-3p, miR-626, miR-662, miR-3182, miR-4274, and miR-4295, were clustered as potential candidates for use in identifying PDND from PD-MCI. Another independent cohort of 120 participants was further recruited in a validation step in order to detect candidate microRNAs via droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), which was used for its high sensitivity in detecting low miRNA concentrations. Our results show that the ratio of miR-203a-3p/miR-16-5p, in which miR-16-5p was used as a reference control miRNA, was significantly increased in PDD compared to that seen in PD-MCI and PDND individually, and was negatively correlated with the MoCA scores (r = -0.237, ",2024,Parkinson’s disease; cognitive decline; droplet digital PCR; microRNA; plasma biomarker,Humans; Parkinson Disease; MicroRNAs; Circulating MicroRNA; Biomarkers; Dementia,"Hsu, YF; Lin, SP; Chu, YT; Tsai, YT; Huang, JW; Phoa, FKH; Wu, RM"

A Protocol for Evaluating Digital Technology for Monitoring Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Older People and People Living with Dementia in the Community.,"Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance are predictors of poor physical and mental health, including dementia. Long-term digital technology-enabled monitoring of sleep and circadian rhythms in the community has great potential for early diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression, and assessing the effectiveness of interventions. Before novel digital technology-based monitoring can be implemented at scale, its performance and acceptability need to be evaluated and compared to gold-standard methodology in relevant populations. Here, we describe our protocol for the evaluation of novel sleep and circadian technology which we have applied in cognitively intact older adults and are currently using in people living with dementia (PLWD). In this protocol, we test a range of technologies simultaneously at home (7-14 days) and subsequently in a clinical research facility in which gold standard methodology for assessing sleep and circadian physiology is implemented. We emphasize the importance of assessing both nocturnal and diurnal sleep (naps), valid markers of circadian physiology, and that evaluation of technology is best achieved in protocols in which sleep is mildly disturbed and in populations that are relevant to the intended use-case. We provide details on the design, implementation, challenges, and advantages of this protocol, along with examples of datasets.",2024,ageing; circadian; dementia; evaluation; good health; longitudinal; monitoring; sleep; technology; well-being,,"Della Monica, C; Ravindran, KKG; Atzori, G; Lambert, DJ; Rodriguez, T; Mahvash-Mohammadi, S; Bartsch, U; Skeldon, AC; Wells, K; Hampshire, A; Nilforooshan, R; Hassanin, H; Revell, VL; Dijk, DJ"
A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices.

Sex-specific factors associated with acceptance of smartwatches among urban older adults: the Itabashi longitudinal study on aging.,"Smartwatches (SW) are wearable devices that support daily life and monitor an individual's health and activity status. This information is utilized to promote behavior modification, which could help prevent chronic diseases and manage the health of older adults. Despite being interested in SWs, older adults tend to decrease their SW usage as they age. Therefore, understanding the acceptance of SWs among older individuals can facilitate individual health management through digital health technology. This study investigated the factors associated with the acceptance of SWs among older adults in Japan and the variations in the factors by sex. This study utilized data from the 2022 Itabashi Longitudinal Study on Aging, an ongoing cohort study conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology. We included 899 eligible individuals aged ≥65 years. Participants were classified into three groups: possessing SW (possessor group), not possessing SW but interested in possession in the future (interest group), and not interested in possession in the future (non-interest group) using a self-administered questionnaire. The level of SW acceptance was operationally defined as follows: low (non-interest group), medium (interest group), and high (possessor group). Further, we evaluated the association of acceptance and purchase intentions of SWs with sociodemographic variables, technology literacy, and health variables. Among the participants, 4.2% possessed SWs, with no significant sex difference (men, 4.2%; women, 4.3%). Among men, age < 75 years, obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were significantly associated with SW acceptance level. Contrastingly, among women, age < 75 years, living alone, higher household income, and a high score for new device use in the technology literacy category were significantly associated with SW acceptance level. Health-related factors were associated with SW acceptance in men, while technology literacy and sociodemographic factors were associated with SW acceptance in women. Our findings may inform the development of sex-specific interventions and policies for increasing SW utilization among older adults in Japan.",2024,health promotion; mobile health; smart wearables; technology innovativeness; wearable healthcare device,Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Cohort Studies; Aging; Geriatrics; Chronic Disease,"Deguchi, N; Osuka, Y; Kojima, N; Motokawa, K; Iwasaki, M; Inagaki, H; Miyamae, F; Okamura, T; Hirano, H; Awata, S; Sasai, H"

Machine Learning and Digital Biomarkers Can Detect Early Stages of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are devastating conditions that can develop without noticeable symptoms, causing irreversible damage to neurons before any signs become clinically evident. NDs are a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Currently, there are no cures or treatments to halt their progression. Therefore, the development of early detection methods is urgently needed to delay neuronal loss as soon as possible. Despite advancements in Medtech, the early diagnosis of NDs remains a challenge at the intersection of medical, IT, and regulatory fields. Thus, this review explores ""digital biomarkers"" (tools designed for remote neurocognitive data collection and AI analysis) as a potential solution. The review summarizes that recent studies combining AI with digital biomarkers suggest the possibility of identifying pre-symptomatic indicators of NDs. For instance, research utilizing convolutional neural networks for eye tracking has achieved significant diagnostic accuracies. ROC-AUC scores reached up to 0.88, indicating high model performance in differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls. Similarly, advancements in facial expression analysis through tools have demonstrated significant potential in detecting emotional changes in ND patients, with some models reaching an accuracy of 0.89 and a precision of 0.85. This review follows a structured approach to article selection, starting with a comprehensive database search and culminating in a rigorous quality assessment and meaning for NDs of the different methods. The process is visualized in 10 tables with 54 parameters describing different approaches and their consequences for understanding various mechanisms in ND changes. However, these methods also face challenges related to data accuracy and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this review proposes strategies that emphasize the need for rigorous validation and rapid integration into clinical practice. Such integration could transform ND diagnostics, making early detection tools more cost-effective and globally accessible. In conclusion, this review underscores the urgent need to incorporate validated digital health tools into mainstream medical practice. This integration could indicate a new era in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially altering the trajectory of these conditions for millions worldwide. Thus, by highlighting specific and statistically significant findings, this review demonstrates the current progress in this field and the potential impact of these advancements on the global management of NDs.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; digital endpoints; digital phenotyping; early detection; eye-tracking; machine learning; neurodegenerative diseases; online cognitive testing,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Biomarkers; Machine Learning,"Chudzik, A; Śledzianowski, A; Przybyszewski, AW"
Numerosity estimation of virtual humans as a digital-robotic marker for hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.,"Hallucinations are frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with dementia and higher mortality. Despite their high clinical relevance, current assessments of hallucinations are based on verbal self-reports and interviews that are limited by important biases. Here, we used virtual reality (VR), robotics, and digital online technology to quantify presence hallucination (vivid sensations that another person is nearby when no one is actually present and can neither be seen nor heard) in laboratory and home-based settings. We establish that elevated numerosity estimation of virtual human agents in VR is a digital marker for experimentally induced presence hallucinations in healthy participants, as confirmed across several control conditions and analyses. We translated the digital marker (numerosity estimation) to an online procedure that 170 PD patients carried out remotely at their homes, revealing that PD patients with disease-related presence hallucinations (but not control PD patients) showed higher numerosity estimation. Numerosity estimation enables quantitative monitoring of hallucinations, is an easy-to-use unobtrusive online method, reaching people far away from medical centers, translating neuroscientific findings using robotics and VR, to patients' homes without specific equipment or trained staff.",2024,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Hallucinations,"Albert, L; Potheegadoo, J; Herbelin, B; Bernasconi, F; Blanke, O"

The participants were 20 adults (aged 42-79 years) who were involved in community-based activities for dementia prevention held by a certain organization. The participants were assigned randomly to the intervention (SoroTouch) group or control group. The SoroTouch group received home-based cognitive training with SoroTouch, being asked to use the software every day for 6 months, while the control group did not receive any intervention. To investigate the effect of SoroTouch, CogEvo, a cognitive functions test battery utilizing a tablet device, was administered to all participants once per month during the 6-month intervention period. In addition, before and after the intervention, all participants were asked to take the CogEvo and the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). The analyses showed that the SoroTouch group did not improve total scores of the CogEvo and MoCA-J, but large group differences were observed in the two tasks of the CogEvo as follows: 'Follow the order' (modified Trail Making Test) at 2 months after the beginning of the intervention (group differences; 39.4, 95% confidence interval; 7.6-71.2) and 'Route 99' at 6 months (group differences; 39.6, 95% confidence interval; 4.9-74.4).

Digitalization of Activities of Daily Living and Its Influence on Social Participation for Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Scoping Review.,"Everyday technology (ET) has been defined as the broad set of devices and artefacts that are currently present in people's lives both inside and outside of the home. A subgroup within ET is known as everyday information and communication technologies (EICTs). The main characteristic of these technologies is that they can facilitate or disrupt the engagement of individuals in their daily activities. This scoping review aims to identify what is known about how ET can function as facilitators or barriers to occupations, such as the social participation of older adults. The proposed scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines and checklist. The scoping review was conducted across five online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE and PsycoINFO [EBSCO]) to identify published, peer-reviewed records. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers against the inclusion criteria. This review considered studies concerning the use of ET or EICTs in community-dwelling adults aged over 60 years, with or without cognitive impairment or dementia. All of the articles were in English, and reviews were not included. Eleven papers were selected and showed that despite the increasing demand for technologies of daily life and the digitalization of society and processes, according to our research, few studies addressed the limitations in the social participation of older adults. In conclusion, ET can provide a way to promote and maintain the personal autonomy for older adults in community dwellings. However, cognitive impairment hinders the use of electronic technologies and increases perceived problems.",2024,daily; everyday technology; occupational therapy,,"Mendoza-Holgado, C; García-González, I; López-Espuela, F"
Bone scan findings of Paget's disease of bone in patients with VCP Multisystem Proteinopathy 1.,"Multisystem Proteinopathy 1 (MSP1) disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP) gene with clinical features of inclusion body myopathy (IBM), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Paget's disease of bone (PDB). We performed bone scan imaging in twelve patients (6 females, 6 males) with confirmed VCP gene mutation six (50%) of which has myopathy alone, four (33%) with both PDB and myopathy, and two (15%) were presymptomatic carriers. We aim to characterize the PDB in diagnosed individuals, and potentially identify PDB in the myopathy and presymptomatic groups. Interestingly, two patients with previously undiagnosed PDB had positive diagnostic findings on the bone scan and subsequent radiograph imaging. Among the individuals with PDB, increased radiotracer uptake of the affected bones were of typical distribution as seen in conventional PDB and those reported in other MSP1 cohorts which are the thoracic spine and ribs (75%), pelvis (75%), shoulder (75%) and calvarium (15%). Overall, we show that technetium-99m bone scans done at regular intervals are a sensitive screening tool in patients with MSP1 associated VCP variants at risk for PDB. However, diagnostic confirmation should be coupled with clinical history, biochemical analysis, and skeletal radiographs to facilitate early treatment and prevention complications, acknowledging its limited specificity.",2024,,"Male; Female; Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Valosin Containing Protein; Cell Cycle Proteins; Osteitis Deformans; Merozoite Surface Protein 1; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Mutation; Myositis, Inclusion Body; Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle","Columbres, RCA; Din, S; Gibbs, L; Kimonis, V"

Modeling and mobile home monitoring of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).,"With the increasing global aging population, dementia care has rapidly become a major social problem. Current diagnosis of Behavior and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) relies on clinical interviews, and behavioral rating scales based on a period of behavior observation, but these methods are not suitable for identification of occurrence of BPSD in the daily living, which is necessary for providing appropriate interventions for dementia, though, has been studied by few research groups in the literature. To address these issues, in this study developed a BPSD monitoring system consisting of a Psycho-Cognitive (PsyCo) BPSD model, a Behavior-Physio-Environment (BePhyEn) BPSD model, and an implementation platform. The PsyCo BPSD model provides BPSD assessment support to caregivers and care providers, while the BePhyEn BPSD model provides instantaneous alerts for BPSD enabled by a 24-hour home monitoring platform for early intervention, and thereby alleviation of burden to patients and caregivers. Data for acquiring the models were generated through extensive literature review and regularity determined. A mobile robot was utilized as the implementation platform for improving sensitivity of sensors for home monitoring, and elderly individual following algorithms were investigated. Experiments in a virtual home environment showed that, a virtual BPSD elderly individual can be followed safely by the robot, and BPSD occurrence could be identified accurately, demonstrating the possibility of modeling and identification of BPSD in home environment.",2024,BPSD models; Home monitoring robots; Identification of occurrence of BPSD,Humans; Aged; Dementia; Caregivers; Behavioral Symptoms,"Yuan, H; Yang, T; Xie, Q; Lledos, G; Chou, WH; Yu, W"

Translation of HTT1a leads to the expression of the highly toxic HTT exon 1 protein fragment. We have previously shown that the levels of HTT1a expression in mouse models of HD is dependent on the CAG repeat length. However, these data are lacking for human tissues.",2024,Alternative splicing; Biomarker; Digital PCR; Huntington disease; Neurodegeneration,Adult; Animals; Humans; Mice; Exons; Huntingtin Protein; Huntington Disease; Neurons; RNA; Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion,"Hoschek, F; Natan, J; Wagner, M; Sathasivam, K; Abdelmoez, A; von Einem, B; Bates, GP; Landwehrmeyer, GB; Neueder, A"
Developing blood-brain barrier arterial spin labelling as a non-invasive early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (DEBBIE-AD): a prospective observational multicohort study protocol.,"Loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is hypothesised to be one of the earliest microvascular signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing BBB integrity imaging methods involve contrast agents or ionising radiation, and pose limitations in terms of cost and logistics. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion MRI has been recently adapted to map the BBB permeability non-invasively. The DEveloping BBB-ASL as a non-Invasive Early biomarker (DEBBIE) consortium aims to develop this modified ASL-MRI technique for patient-specific and robust BBB permeability assessments.

Developing the Healthy Actions and Lifestyles to Avoid Dementia or ,"With Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) representing an enormous public health challenge, there is a need to support individuals in learning about and addressing their modifiable risk factors (e.g., diet, sleep, and physical activity) to prevent or delay dementia onset. However, there is limited availability for evidence-informed tools that deliver both quality education and support for positive behavior change such as by increasing self-efficacy and personalizing goal setting.

Ethical issues when using digital biomarkers and artificial intelligence for the early detection of dementia.,"Dementia poses a growing challenge for health services but remains stigmatized and under-recognized. Digital technologies to aid the earlier detection of dementia are approaching market. These include traditional cognitive screening tools presented on mobile devices, smartphone native applications, passive data collection from wearable, in-home and in-car sensors, as well as machine learning techniques applied to clinic and imaging data. It has been suggested that earlier detection and diagnosis may help patients plan for their future, achieve a better quality of life, and access clinical trials and possible future disease modifying treatments. In this review, we explore whether digital tools for the early detection of dementia can or should be deployed, by assessing them against the principles of ethical screening programs. We conclude that while the importance of dementia as a health problem is unquestionable, significant challenges remain. There is no available treatment which improves the prognosis of diagnosed disease. Progression from early-stage disease to dementia is neither given nor currently predictable. Available technologies are generally not both minimally invasive and highly accurate. Digital deployment risks exacerbating health inequalities due to biased training data and inequity in digital access. Finally, the acceptability of early dementia detection is not established, and resources would be needed to ensure follow-up and support for those flagged by any new system. We conclude that early dementia detection deployed at scale via digital technologies does not meet standards for a screening program and we offer recommendations for moving toward an ethical mode of implementation.

Investigating the efficacy and importance of mobile-based assessments for Parkinson's disease: uncovering the potential of novel digital tests.,"This study introduces PDMotion, a mobile application comprising 11 digital tests, including those adapted from the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III and novel assessments, for remote Parkinson's Disease (PD) motor symptoms evaluation. Employing machine learning techniques on data from 50 PD patients and 29 healthy controls, PDMotion achieves accuracies of 0.878 for PD status prediction and 0.715 for severity assessment. A post-hoc explanation model is employed to assess the importance of features and tasks in diagnosis and severity evaluation. Notably, novel tasks that are not adapted from MDS-UPDRS Part III like the circle drawing, coordination test, and alternative tapping test are found to be highly important, suggesting digital assessments for PD can go beyond digitizing existing tests. The alternative tapping test emerges as the most significant task. Using its features alone achieves prediction accuracies comparable to the full task set, underscoring its potential as an independent screening tool. This study addresses a notable research gap by digitalizing a wide array of tests, including novel ones, and conducting a comparative analysis of their feature and task importance. These insights provide guidance for task selection and future development in PD mobile assessments, a field previously lacking such comparative studies.",2024,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Machine Learning; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Mobile Applications; Paracentesis,"Zhang, Y; Zeng, Z; Mirian, MS; Yen, K; Park, KW; Doo, M; Ji, J; Shen, Z; McKeown, MJ"
Performance of digital technologies in assessing fall risks among older adults with cognitive impairment: a systematic review.,"Older adults with cognitive impairment (CI) are twice as likely to fall compared to the general older adult population. Traditional fall risk assessments may not be suitable for older adults with CI due to their reliance on attention and recall. Hence, there is an interest in using objective technology-based fall risk assessment tools to assess falls within this population. This systematic review aims to evaluate the features and performance of technology-based fall risk assessment tools for older adults with CI. A systematic search was conducted across several databases such as PubMed and IEEE Xplore, resulting in the inclusion of 22 studies. Most studies focused on participants with dementia. The technologies included sensors, mobile applications, motion capture, and virtual reality. Fall risk assessments were conducted in the community, laboratory, and institutional settings; with studies incorporating continuous monitoring of older adults in everyday environments. Studies used a combination of technology-based inputs of gait parameters, socio-demographic indicators, and clinical assessments. However, many missed the opportunity to include cognitive performance inputs as predictors to fall risk. The findings of this review support the use of technology-based fall risk assessment tools for older adults with CI. Further advancements incorporating cognitive measures and additional longitudinal studies are needed to improve the effectiveness and clinical applications of these assessment tools. Additional work is also required to compare the performance of existing methods for fall risk assessment, technology-based fall risk assessments, and the combination of these approaches.",2024,Cognitive impairment; Digital technologies; Fall prediction; Falls risk assessment; Older adults,Humans; Aged; Digital Technology; Cognitive Dysfunction; Risk Assessment; Gait,"Koh, V; Xuan, LW; Zhe, TK; Singh, N; B Matchar, D; Chan, A"

Speech-Based Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Research.,"Digital biomarkers are of growing interest in the field of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research. Digital biomarker data arising from digital health tools holds various potential benefits: more objective and more accurate assessment of patients' symptoms and remote collection of signals in real-world scenarios but also multimodal variance for prediction models of individual disease progression. Speech can be collected at minimal patient burden and provides rich data for assessing multiple aspects of AD pathology including cognition. However, the operations around collecting, preparing, and validly interpreting speech data within the context of clinical research on AD remains complex and sometimes challenging. Through a dedicated pipeline of speech collection tools, preprocessing steps and algorithms, precise qualification and quantification of an AD patient's pathology can be achieved from their speech.

Blood-Based Biomarkers for Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in Real-World Settings.,"As our knowledge about the biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) expands and we recognize the significance of early intervention for effective treatment, there is a shift in focus toward detecting the disease at an early stage. AD is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau proteins in the brain, leading to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While a definitive diagnosis of AD can only be confirmed through autopsy by examining these pathological features, there are now reliable methods available for diagnosing the disease in living individuals. These methods involve analyzing cerebrospinal fluid and using positron emission tomography to accurately assess the presence of Aβ and tau proteins. While these diagnostic markers have shown high accuracy in memory-clinic populations, they do have limitations such as the requirement for invasive lumbar puncture or exposure to ionizing radiation. Additionally, they are not easily accessible outside of specialized healthcare settings. Blood-based biomarkers of the core pathological features of AD are being developed, showing promise for less invasive, scalable identification of AD cases in the community. The advantages for the healthcare systems of this development are obvious, but the diagnostic performance of blood-based biomarkers in broader, non-selected populations outside of retrospective analyses and research cohorts still requires further investigation, including the combination with more effective neuropsychological assessments such as digital cognitive test solutions.",2024,Early and targeted treatment and prevention of neurodegeneration; Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; Patient and service user value; Scalable diagnostic technologies; Subjective cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Retrospective Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers,"Perneczky, R; Hansen, N; Hofmann, A; Laske, C; Priller, J; Grimmer, T; Frölich, L; Düzel, E; Jessen, F; Wiltfang, J"
Early detection of diseases causing dementia using digital navigation and gait measures: A systematic review of evidence.,"Wearable digital technologies capable of measuring everyday behaviors could improve the early detection of dementia-causing diseases.

Of 316 navigation and 2086 gait records identified, 27 and 83, respectively, were included in the final sample. We highlight several measures that may identify at-risk individuals, whose quantifiability with different devices mitigates the risk of future technological obsolescence.

Low-frequency rTMS modulated the excitability and high-frequency firing in hippocampal neurons of the Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, holds potential for applications in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to compare the therapeutic effects of rTMS at different frequencies on Alzheimer's disease and explore the alterations in neuronal electrophysiological properties throughout this process. APP/PS1 AD mice were subjected to two rTMS treatments at 0.5 Hz and 20 Hz, followed by assessments of therapeutic outcomes through the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests. Following this, whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used to record action potential, voltage-gated sodium channel currents, and voltage-gated potassium channel currents in dentate gyrus granule neurons. The results show that AD mice exhibit significant cognitive decline compared to normal mice, along with a pronounced reduction in neuronal excitability and ion channel activity. Both frequencies of rTMS treatment partially reversed these changes, demonstrating similar therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the investigation indicates that low-frequency magnetic stimulation inhibited the concentrated firing of early action potentials in AD.",2024,Action potential; Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive function; Potassium channels; Sodium channels; rTMS,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Neurons; Hippocampus; Action Potentials; Disease Models, Animal","Zhang, Z; Ding, C; Fu, R; Wang, J; Zhao, J; Zhu, H"

Non-invasive modulation of meningeal lymphatics ameliorates ageing and Alzheimer's disease-associated pathology and cognition in mice.,"Meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) have been shown to be involved in amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance, which is considered as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, based on the superficial spatial distribution of mLVs, a near-infrared light is employed to modulate lymphatic drainage, significantly improving cognition of both aged and AD (5xFAD and APP/PS1) mice, and alleviating AD-associated pathology by reducing Aβ deposition, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy imaging and RNA sequencing data indicate amelioration of mitochondrial metabolism and cellular junction of meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells (mLECs) by light modulation. These studies collectively suggest that near-infrared light treatment can improve cognitive function by strengthening scavenging ability of mLVs through restoring mLEC function. In conclusion, lymphatic drainage potentiation by light promotes pathological remission and cognitive enhancement in aging and AD mouse models, which offers a potential amelioration strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mice, Transgenic; Endothelial Cells; Cognition; Aging; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Wang, M; Yan, C; Li, X; Yang, T; Wu, S; Liu, Q; Luo, Q; Zhou, F"

A screening method for mild cognitive impairment in elderly individuals combining bioimpedance and MMSE.,"We investigated a screening method for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that combined bioimpedance features and the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) score. Data were collected from 539 subjects aged 60 years or older at the Gwangju Alzheimer's & Related Dementias (GARD) Cohort Research Center, A total of 470 participants were used for the analysis, including 318 normal controls and 152 MCI participants. We measured bioimpedance, K-MMSE, and the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB-II). We developed a multiple linear regression model to predict MCI by combining bioimpedance variables and K-MMSE total score and compared the model's accuracy with SNSB-II domain scores by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We additionally compared the model performance with several machine learning models such as extreme gradient boosting, random forest, support vector machine, and elastic net. To test the model performances, the dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). The AUROC values of SNSB-II scores were 0.803 in both sexes, 0.840 for males, and 0.770 for females. In the combined model, the AUROC values were 0.790 (0.773) for males (and females), which were significantly higher than those from the model including MMSE scores alone (0.723 for males and 0.622 for females) or bioimpedance variables alone (0.640 for males and 0.615 for females). Furthermore, the accuracies of the combined model were comparable to those of machine learning models. The bioimpedance-MMSE combined model effectively distinguished the MCI participants and suggests a technique for rapid and improved screening of the elderly population at risk of cognitive impairment.",2024,bioimpedance analysis; combination of bioimpedance and MMSE; dementia; mild cognitive impairment; screening,,"Jun, MH; Ku, B; Kim, K; Lee, KH; Kim, JU"

Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories: Innovating aging research and Alzheimer's care.,"This perspective outlines the Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories (AITC) at Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Massachusetts, highlighting their roles in developing AI-based technologies for older adult care, particularly targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD). These National Institute on Aging (NIA) centers foster collaboration among clinicians, gerontologists, ethicists, business professionals, and engineers to create AI solutions. Key activities include identifying technology needs, stakeholder engagement, training, mentoring, data integration, and navigating ethical challenges. The objective is to apply these innovations effectively in real-world scenarios, including in rural settings. In addition, the AITC focuses on developing best practices for AI application in the care of older adults, facilitating pilot studies, and addressing ethical concerns related to technology development for older adults with cognitive impairment, with the ultimate aim of improving the lives of older adults and their caregivers. HIGHLIGHTS: Addressing the complex needs of older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a comprehensive approach, integrating medical and social support. Current gaps in training, techniques, tools, and expertise hinder uniform access across communities and health care settings. Artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies hold promise in transforming care for this demographic. Yet, transitioning these innovations from concept to marketable products presents significant challenges, often stalling promising advancements in the developmental phase. The Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories (AITC) program, funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), presents a viable model. These Collaboratories foster the development and implementation of AI methods and technologies through projects aimed at improving care for older Americans, particularly those with AD, and promote the sharing of best practices in AI and technology integration. Why Does This Matter? The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories (AITC) program's mission is to accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and new technologies for the betterment of older adults, especially those with dementia. By bridging scientific and technological expertise, fostering clinical and industry partnerships, and enhancing the sharing of best practices, this program can significantly improve the health and quality of life for older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD).",2024,Alzheimer's disease; artificial intelligence; healthy aging; machine learning; older adults; pilot studies; technology,United States; Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Geroscience; Quality of Life; Technology; Isothiocyanates,"Abadir, P; Oh, E; Chellappa, R; Choudhry, N; Demiris, G; Ganesan, D; Karlawish, J; Marlin, B; Li, RM; Dehak, N; Arbaje, A; Unberath, M; Cudjoe, T; Chute, C; Moore, JH; Phan, P; Samus, Q; Schoenborn, NL; Battle, A; Walston, JD"

"Poor Oral Health Is Associated With Inflammation, Aortic Valve Calcification, and Brain Volume Among Forager-Farmers.","Poor oral health is associated with cardiovascular disease and dementia. Potential pathways include sepsis from oral bacteria, systemic inflammation, and nutritional deficiencies. However, in post-industrialized populations, links between oral health and chronic disease may be confounded because the lower socioeconomic exposome (poor diet, pollution, and low physical activity) often entails insufficient dental care. We assessed tooth loss, caries, and damaged teeth, in relation to cardiovascular and brain aging among the Tsimane, a subsistence population living a relatively traditional forager-horticulturalist lifestyle with poor dental health, but minimal cardiovascular disease and dementia. Dental health was assessed by a physician in 739 participants aged 40-92 years with cardiac and brain health measured by chest computed tomography (CT; n = 728) and brain CT (n = 605). A subset of 356 individuals aged 60+ were also assessed for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (n = 33 impaired). Tooth loss was highly prevalent, with 2.2 teeth lost per decade and a 2-fold greater loss in women. The number of teeth with exposed pulp was associated with higher inflammation, as measured by cytokine levels and white blood cell counts, and lower body mass index. Coronary artery calcium and thoracic aortic calcium were not associated with tooth loss or damaged teeth. However, aortic valve calcification and brain tissue loss were higher in those who had more teeth with exposed pulp. Overall, these results suggest that dental health is associated with indicators of chronic diseases in the absence of typical confounds, even in a population with low cardiovascular and dementia risk factors.",2024,Cardiovascular disease; Chronic disease; Dementia; Tooth loss; Tsimane,"Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Oral Health; Middle Aged; Calcinosis; Aortic Valve; Aged, 80 and over; Inflammation; Brain; Adult; Tooth Loss; Dementia; Aortic Valve Stenosis; Cognitive Dysfunction; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Organ Size","Trumble, BC; Schwartz, M; Ozga, AT; Schwartz, GT; Stojanowski, CM; Jenkins, CL; Kraft, TS; Garcia, AR; Cummings, DK; Hooper, PL; Eid Rodriguez, D; Buetow, K; Beheim, B; Irimia, A; Thomas, GS; Thompson, RC; Gatz, M; Stieglitz, J; Finch, CE; Gurven, M; Kaplan, H"

Multi-trait analysis characterizes the genetics of thyroid function and identifies causal associations with clinical implications.,"To date only a fraction of the genetic footprint of thyroid function has been clarified. We report a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of thyroid function in up to 271,040 individuals of European ancestry, including reference range thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free and total triiodothyronine (T3), proxies for metabolism (T3/FT4 ratio) as well as dichotomized high and low TSH levels. We revealed 259 independent significant associations for TSH (61% novel), 85 for FT4 (67% novel), and 62 novel signals for the T3 related traits. The loci explained 14.1%, 6.0%, 9.5% and 1.1% of the total variation in TSH, FT4, total T3 and free T3 concentrations, respectively. Genetic correlations indicate that TSH associated loci reflect the thyroid function determined by free T3, whereas the FT4 associations represent the thyroid hormone metabolism. Polygenic risk score and Mendelian randomization analyses showed the effects of genetically determined variation in thyroid function on various clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. In conclusion, our results improve the understanding of thyroid hormone physiology and highlight the pleiotropic effects of thyroid function on various diseases.",2024,,Humans; Thyroid Gland; Thyroxine; Genome-Wide Association Study; Triiodothyronine; Thyrotropin,"Sterenborg, RBTM; Steinbrenner, I; Li, Y; Bujnis, MN; Naito, T; Marouli, E; Galesloot, TE; Babajide, O; Andreasen, L; Astrup, A; Åsvold, BO; Bandinelli, S; Beekman, M; Beilby, JP; Bork-Jensen, J; Boutin, T; Brody, JA; Brown, SJ; Brumpton, B; Campbell, PJ; Cappola, AR; Ceresini, G; Chaker, L; Chasman, DI; Concas, MP; Coutinho de Almeida, R; Cross, SM; Cucca, F; Deary, IJ; Kjaergaard, AD; Echouffo Tcheugui, JB; Ellervik, C; Eriksson, JG; Ferrucci, L; Freudenberg, J; Fuchsberger, C; Gieger, C; Giulianini, F; Gögele, M; Graham, SE; Grarup, N; Gunjača, I; Hansen, T; Harding, BN; Harris, SE; Haunsø, S; Hayward, C; Hui, J; Ittermann, T; Jukema, JW; Kajantie, E; Kanters, JK; Kårhus, LL; Kiemeney, LALM; Kloppenburg, M; Kühnel, B; Lahti, J; Langenberg, C; Lapauw, B; Leese, G; Li, S; Liewald, DCM; Linneberg, A; Lominchar, JVT; Luan, J; Martin, NG; Matana, A; Meima, ME; Meitinger, T; Meulenbelt, I; Mitchell, BD; Møllehave, LT; Mora, S; Naitza, S; Nauck, M; Netea-Maier, RT; Noordam, R; Nursyifa, C; Okada, Y; Onano, S; Papadopoulou, A; Palmer, CNA; Pattaro, C; Pedersen, O; Peters, A; Pietzner, M; Polašek, O; Pramstaller, PP; Psaty, BM; Punda, A; Ray, D; Redmond, P; Richards, JB; Ridker, PM; Russ, TC; Ryan, KA; Olesen, MS; Schultheiss, UT; Selvin, E; Siddiqui, MK; Sidore, C; Slagboom, PE; Sørensen, TIA; Soto-Pedre, E; Spector, TD; Spedicati, B; Srinivasan, S; Starr, JM; Stott, DJ; Tanaka, T; Torlak, V; Trompet, S; Tuhkanen, J; Uitterlinden, AG; van den Akker, EB; van den Eynde, T; van der Klauw, MM; van Heemst, D; Verroken, C; Visser, WE; Vojinovic, D; Völzke, H; Waldenberger, M; Walsh, JP; Wareham, NJ; Weiss, S; Willer, CJ; Wilson, SG; Wolffenbuttel, BHR; Wouters, HJCM; Wright, MJ; Yang, Q; Zemunik, T; Zhou, W; Zhu, G; Zöllner, S; Smit, JWA; Peeters, RP; Köttgen, A; Teumer, A; Medici, M"

Estimating dementia risk in an African American population using the DCTclock.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is increasing. African Americans are twice as likely to develop dementia than other ethnic populations. Traditional cognitive screening solutions lack the sensitivity to independently identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline. The DCTclock is a 3-min AI-enabled adaptation of the well-established clock drawing test. The DCTclock can estimate dementia risk for both general cognitive impairment and the presence of AD pathology. Here we performed a retrospective analysis to assess the performance of the DCTclock to estimate future conversion to ADRD in African American participants from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and African American Clinical Core (AACORE). We assessed baseline DCTclock scores in 646 participants (baseline median age = 78.0 ± 6.4, median years of education = 14.0 ± 3.2, 78% female) and found significantly lower baseline DCTclock scores in those who received a dementia diagnosis within 3 years. We also found that 16.4% of participants with a baseline DCTclock score less than 60 were significantly more likely to develop dementia in 5 years vs. those with the highest DCTclock scores (75-100). This research demonstrates the DCTclock's ability to estimate the 5-year risk of developing dementia in an African American population. Early detection of elevated dementia risk using the DCTclock could provide patients, caregivers, and clinicians opportunities to plan and intervene early to improve cognitive health trajectories. Early detection of dementia risk can also enhance participant selection in clinical trials while reducing screening costs.",2023,African American clinical; Alzheimer’s disease; DCTclock; Minority Aging Research Study (MARS); Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center; dementia; dementia estimation,,"Ciesla, M; Pobst, J; Gomes-Osman, J; Lamar, M; Barnes, LL; Banks, R; Jannati, A; Libon, D; Swenson, R; Tobyne, S; Bates, D; Showalter, J; Pascual-Leone, A"

Extracting Symptoms of Agitation in Dementia from Free-Text Nursing Notes Using Advanced Natural Language Processing.,"Nursing staff record observations about older people under their care in free-text nursing notes. These notes contain older people's care needs, disease symptoms, frequency of symptom occurrence, nursing actions, etc. Therefore, it is vital to develop a technique to uncover important data from these notes. This study developed and evaluated a deep learning and transfer learning-based named entity recognition (NER) model for extracting symptoms of agitation in dementia from the nursing notes. We employed a Clinical BioBERT model for word embedding. Then we applied bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) and conditional random field (CRF) models for NER on nursing notes from Australian residential aged care facilities. The proposed NER model achieves satisfactory performance in extracting symptoms of agitation in dementia with a 75% F1 score and 78% accuracy.

Digging into the intrinsic capacity concept: Can it be applied to Alzheimer's disease?,"Historically, aging research has largely centered on disease pathology rather than promoting healthy aging. The World Health Organization's (WHO) policy framework (2015-2030) underscores the significance of fostering the contributions of older individuals to their families, communities, and economies. The WHO has introduced the concept of intrinsic capacity (IC) as a key metric for healthy aging, encompassing five primary domains: locomotion, vitality, sensory, cognitive, and psychological. Past AD research, constrained by methodological limitations, has focused on single outcome measures, sidelining the complexity of the disease. Our current scientific milieu, however, is primed to adopt the IC concept. This is due to three critical considerations: (I) the decline in IC is linked to neurocognitive disorders, including AD, (II) cognition, a key component of IC, is deeply affected in AD, and (III) the cognitive decline associated with AD involves multiple factors and pathophysiological pathways. Our study explores the application of the IC concept to AD patients, offering a comprehensive model that could revolutionize the disease's diagnosis and prognosis. There is a dearth of information on the biological characteristics of IC, which are a result of complex interactions within biological systems. Employing a systems biology approach, integrating omics technologies, could aid in unraveling these interactions and understanding IC from a holistic viewpoint. This comprehensive analysis of IC could be leveraged in clinical settings, equipping healthcare providers to assess AD patients' health status more effectively and devise personalized therapeutic interventions in accordance with the precision medicine paradigm. We aimed to determine whether the IC concept could be extended from older individuals to patients with AD, thereby presenting a model that could significantly enhance the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Digital biomarkers; Digital healthcare; Dimensions; Intrinsic capacity; Systems biology,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aging,"López-Ortiz, S; Caruso, G; Emanuele, E; Menéndez, H; Peñín-Grandes, S; Guerrera, CS; Caraci, F; Nisticò, R; Lucia, A; Santos-Lozano, A; Lista, S"

Digital interventions (mobile, web-based, virtual reality, and video game applications) demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for people living with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. In the respective animal disease models, preclinical studies on environmental enrichment and other non-pharmacological modalities (physical activity, social interactions, learning, and music) as surrogates for DTx ""active ingredients"" also show improved outcomes. In this narrative review, we discuss how drug + digital combination therapies can impact translational research, drug discovery and development, generic drug repurposing, and gene therapies.

Enhancing foveal avascular zone analysis for Alzheimer's diagnosis with AI segmentation and machine learning using multiple radiomic features.,"We propose a hybrid technique that employs artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation and machine learning classification using multiple features extracted from the foveal avascular zone (FAZ)-a retinal biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-to improve the disease diagnostic performance. Imaging data of optical coherence tomography angiography from 37 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 48 healthy controls were investigated. The presence or absence of brain amyloids was confirmed using amyloid positron emission tomography. In the superficial capillary plexus of the angiography scans, the FAZ was automatically segmented using an AI method to extract multiple biomarkers (area, solidity, compactness, roundness, and eccentricity), which were paired with clinical data (age and sex) as common correction variables. We used a light-gradient boosting machine (a light-gradient boosting machine is a machine learning algorithm based on trees utilizing gradient boosting) to diagnose Alzheimer's disease by integrating the corresponding multiple radiomic biomarkers. Fivefold cross-validation was applied for analysis, and the diagnostic performance for Alzheimer's disease was determined by the area under the curve. The proposed hybrid technique achieved an area under the curve of [Formula: see text]%, outperforming the existing single-feature (area) criteria by over 13%. Furthermore, in the holdout test set, the proposed technique exhibited a 14% improvement compared to single features, achieving an area under the curve of 72.0± 4.8%. Based on these facts, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our technology in achieving significant performance improvements in FAZ-based Alzheimer's diagnosis research through the use of multiple radiomic biomarkers (area, solidity, compactness, roundness, and eccentricity).",2024,,"Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Alzheimer Disease; Radiomics; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Machine Learning; Biomarkers","Yoon, JM; Lim, CY; Noh, H; Nam, SW; Jun, SY; Kim, MJ; Song, MY; Jang, H; Kim, HJ; Seo, SW; Na, DL; Chung, MJ; Ham, DI; Kim, K"
Developing an ontology of non-pharmacological treatment for emotional and mood disturbances in dementia.,"Emotional and mood disturbances are common in people with dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions are beneficial for managing these disturbances. However, effectively applying these interventions, particularly in the person-centred approach, is a complex and knowledge-intensive task. Healthcare professionals need the assistance of tools to obtain all relevant information that is often buried in a vast amount of clinical data to form a holistic understanding of the person for successfully applying non-pharmacological interventions. A machine-readable knowledge model, e.g., ontology, can codify the research evidence to underpin these tools. For the first time, this study aims to develop an ontology entitled Dementia-Related Emotional And Mood Disturbance Non-Pharmacological Treatment Ontology (DREAMDNPTO). DREAMDNPTO consists of 1258 unique classes (concepts) and 70 object properties that represent relationships between these classes. It meets the requirements and quality standards for biomedical ontology. As DREAMDNPTO provides a computerisable semantic representation of knowledge specific to non-pharmacological treatment for emotional and mood disturbances in dementia, it will facilitate the application of machine learning to this particular and important health domain of emotional and mood disturbance management for people with dementia.",2024,,Humans; Emotions; Mood Disorders; Biological Ontologies; Health Personnel; Dementia,"Zhang, Z; Yu, P; Yin, M; Chang, HC; Thomas, SJ; Wei, W; Song, T; Deng, C"
"Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Imaging of Atherosclerotic Intracranial Disease.","Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of stroke worldwide. Among people with stroke, those of East Asia descent and non-White populations in the United States have a higher burden of ICAD-related stroke compared with Whites of European descent. Disparities in the prevalence of asymptomatic ICAD are less marked than with symptomatic ICAD. In addition to stroke, ICAD increases the risk of dementia and cognitive decline, magnifying ICAD societal burden. The risk of stroke recurrence among patients with ICAD-related stroke is the highest among those with confirmed stroke and stenosis ≥70%. In fact, the 1-year recurrent stroke rate of >20% among those with stenosis >70% is one of the highest rates among common causes of stroke. The mechanisms by which ICAD causes stroke include plaque rupture with in situ thrombosis and occlusion or artery-to-artery embolization, hemodynamic injury, and branch occlusive disease. The risk of stroke recurrence varies by the presumed underlying mechanism of stroke, but whether techniques such as quantitative magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance perfusion, or transcranial Doppler can help with risk stratification beyond the degree of stenosis is less clear. The diagnosis of ICAD is heavily reliant on lumen-based studies, such as computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography, but newer technologies, such as high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging, can help distinguish ICAD from stenosing arteriopathies.",2024,arteries; cerebral infarction; demography; intracranial arteriosclerosis; stroke,"Humans; Constriction, Pathologic; Stroke; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Cerebral Infarction; Angiography, Digital Subtraction","Chen, LH; Spagnolo-Allende, A; Yang, D; Qiao, Y; Gutierrez, J"
Intelligent digital tools for screening of brain connectivity and dementia risk estimation in people affected by mild cognitive impairment: the AI-Mind clinical study protocol.,"More than 10 million Europeans show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal brain aging and dementia stage memory disorder. The path MCI takes can be divergent; while some maintain stability or even revert to cognitive norms, alarmingly, up to half of the cases progress to dementia within 5 years. Current diagnostic practice lacks the necessary screening tools to identify those at risk of progression. The European patient experience often involves a long journey from the initial signs of MCI to the eventual diagnosis of dementia. The trajectory is far from ideal. Here, we introduce the AI-Mind project, a pioneering initiative with an innovative approach to early risk assessment through the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) on multimodal data. The cutting-edge AI-based tools developed in the project aim not only to accelerate the diagnostic process but also to deliver highly accurate predictions regarding an individual's risk of developing dementia when prevention and intervention may still be possible. AI-Mind is a European Research and Innovation Action (RIA H2020-SC1-BHC-06-2020, No. 964220) financed between 2021 and 2026.

Shifting From Active to Passive Monitoring of Alzheimer Disease: The State of the Research.,"Most research using digital technologies builds on existing methods for staff-administered evaluation, requiring a large investment of time, effort, and resources. Widespread use of personal mobile devices provides opportunities for continuous health monitoring without active participant engagement. Home-based sensors show promise in evaluating behavioral features in near real time. Digital technologies across these methodologies can detect precise measures of cognition, mood, sleep, gait, speech, motor activity, behavior patterns, and additional features relevant to health. As a neurodegenerative condition with insidious onset, Alzheimer disease and other dementias (AD/D) represent a key target for advances in monitoring disease symptoms. Studies to date evaluating the predictive power of digital measures use inconsistent approaches to characterize these measures. Comparison between different digital collection methods supports the use of passive collection methods in settings in which active participant engagement approaches are not feasible. Additional studies that analyze how digital measures across multiple data streams can together improve prediction of cognitive impairment and early-stage AD are needed. Given the long timeline of progression from normal to diagnosis, digital monitoring will more easily make extended longitudinal follow-up possible. Through the American Heart Association-funded Strategically Focused Research Network, the Boston University investigative team deployed a platform involving a wide range of technologies to address these gaps in research practice. Much more research is needed to thoroughly evaluate limitations of passive monitoring. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to establish legal and ethical frameworks for ensuring passive monitoring can be conducted at scale while protecting privacy and security, especially in vulnerable populations.",2024,Alzheimer disease; cognition; digital health; multimodal data; passive monitoring,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Boston,"Popp, Z; Low, S; Igwe, A; Rahman, MS; Kim, M; Khan, R; Oh, E; Kumar, A; De Anda-Duran, I; Ding, H; Hwang, PH; Sunderaraman, P; Shih, LC; Lin, H; Kolachalama, VB; Au, R"

Training Indigenous Community Researchers for Community-Based Participatory Ethnographic Dementia Research: A Second-Generation Model.,"Conducting community-based participatory research (CBPR) is a complex endeavor, particularly when training non-academic community members. Though examples of CBPR training programs and protocols have been published, they often address a limited set of concepts and are tailored for university or medical school students. Here, we describe the process of developing an online CBPR training program for American Indian (United States) and Indigenous (Canada) community members to conduct multi-sited ethnographic dementia research. This program is unique in its breadth and depth, as our program covers CBPR theory, methods, practical research, and administrative skills. Significantly, this program centers Indigenous methodology, pedagogy, and processes such as two-eyed seeing, storywork, and decolonization approaches. Key to this training program is a ""second-generation"" approach which incorporates experiential knowledge from prior community-based researchers and academic partners and is designed to develop CBPR capacity among community-based researchers and partnering communities. In this paper, we detail the experience of the first cohort of learners and subsequent improvement of the training materials.

Digital remote monitoring for screening and early detection of urinary tract infections.,"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are one of the most prevalent bacterial infections in older adults and a significant contributor to unplanned hospital admissions in People Living with Dementia (PLWD), with early detection being crucial due to the predicament of reporting symptoms and limited help-seeking behaviour. The most common diagnostic tool is urine sample analysis, which can be time-consuming and is only employed where UTI clinical suspicion exists. In this method development and proof-of-concept study, participants living with dementia were monitored via low-cost devices in the home that passively measure activity, sleep, and nocturnal physiology. Using 27828 person-days of remote monitoring data (from 117 participants), we engineered features representing symptoms used for diagnosing a UTI. We then evaluate explainable machine learning techniques in passively calculating UTI risk and perform stratification on scores to support clinical translation and allow control over the balance between alert rate and sensitivity and specificity. The proposed UTI algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 65.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 64.3-66.2) and specificity of 70.9% (68.6-73.1) when predicting UTIs on unseen participants and after risk stratification, a sensitivity of 74.7% (67.9-81.5) and specificity of 87.9% (85.0-90.9). In addition, feature importance methods reveal that the largest contributions to the predictions were bathroom visit statistics, night-time respiratory rate, and the number of previous UTI events, aligning with the literature.

A tablet-based multi-dimensional drawing system can effectively distinguish patients with amnestic MCI from healthy individuals.,"The population with dementia is expected to rise to 152 million in 2050 due to the aging population worldwide. Therefore, it is significant to identify and intervene in the early stage of dementia. The Rey-Osterreth complex figure (ROCF) test is a visuospatial test scale. Its scoring methods are numerous, time-consuming, and inconsistent, which is unsuitable for wide application as required by the high number of people at risk. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a rapid, objective, and sensitive digital scoring method to detect cognitive dysfunction in the early stage accurately. This study aims to clarify the organizational strategy of aMCI patients to draw complex figures through a multi-dimensional digital evaluation system. At the same time, a rapid, objective, and sensitive digital scoring method is established to replace traditional scoring. The data of 64 subjects (38 aMCI patients and 26 NC individuals) were analyzed in this study. All subjects completed the tablet's Geriatric Complex Figure (GCF) test, including copying, 3-min recall, and 20-min delayed recall, and also underwent a standardized neuropsychological test battery and classic ROCF test. Digital GCF (dGCF) variables and conventional GCF (cGCF) scores were input into the forward stepwise logistic regression model to construct classification models. Finally, ROC curves were made to visualize the difference in the diagnostic value of dGCF variables vs. cGCF scores in categorizing the diagnostic groups. In 20-min delayed recall, aMCI patients' time in air and pause time were longer than NC individuals. Patients with aMCI had more short strokes and poorer ability of detail integration (all p < 0.05). The diagnostic sensitivity of dGCF variables for aMCI patients was 89.47%, slightly higher than cGCF scores (sensitivity: 84.21%). The diagnostic accuracy of both was comparable (dGCF: 70.3%; cGCF: 73.4%). Moreover, combining dGCF variables and cGCF scores could significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy and specificity (accuracy: 78.1%, specificity: 84.62%). At the same time, we construct the regression equations of the two models. Our study shows that dGCF equipment can quantitatively evaluate drawing performance, and its performance is comparable to the time-consuming cGCF score. The regression equation of the model we constructed can well identify patients with aMCI in clinical application. We believe this new technique can be a highly effective screening tool for patients with MCI.",2024,,Humans; Aged; Aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Electric Power Supplies; Logistic Models; Tablets; Dementia,"Zhang, X; Lv, L; Shen, J; Chen, J; Zhang, H; Li, Y"

"Agricultural activities and risk of Alzheimer's disease: the TRACTOR project, a nationwide retrospective cohort study.","Data regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurrence in farming populations is lacking. This study aimed to investigate whether, among the entire French farm manager (FM) workforce, certain agricultural activities are more strongly associated with AD than others, using nationwide data from the TRACTOR (Tracking and monitoring occupational risks in agriculture) project. Administrative health insurance data (digital electronic health/medical records and insurance claims) for the entire French agricultural workforce, over the period 2002-2016, on the entire mainland France were used to estimate the risk of AD for 26 agricultural activities with Cox proportional hazards model. For each analysis (one for each activity), the exposed group included all FMs that performed the activity of interest (e.g. crop farming), while the reference group included all FMs who did not carry out the activity of interest (e.g. FMs that never farmed crops between 2002 and 2016). There were 5067 cases among 1,036,069 FMs who worked at least one year between 2002 and 2016. Analyses showed higher risks of AD for crop farming (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.72 [3.47-3.98]), viticulture (HR = 1.29 [1.18-1.42]), and fruit arboriculture (HR = 1.36 [1.15-1.62]). By contrast, lower risks of AD were found for several animal farming types, in particular for poultry and rabbit farming (HR = 0.29 [0.20-0.44]), ovine and caprine farming (HR = 0.50 [0.41-0.61]), mixed dairy and cow farming (HR = 0.46 [0.37-0.57]), dairy farming (HR = 0.67 [0.61-0.73]), and pig farming (HR = 0.30 [0.18-0.52]).

Intron retention as a productive mechanism in human MAPT: RNA species generated by retention of intron 3.,"Tau is a microtubule-binding protein encoded by the MAPT gene. Tau is essential for several physiological functions and associated with pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Six tau isoforms are typically described in the central nervous system, but current research paints a more diverse landscape and a more nuanced balance between isoforms. Recent work has described tau isoforms generated by intron 11 and intron 12 retention. This work adds to that evidence, proving the existence of MAPT transcripts retaining intron 3.

Comprehensive allostatic load risk index is associated with increased frontal and left parietal white matter hyperintensities in mid-life cognitively healthy adults.,"To date, there is a considerable heterogeneity of methods to score Allostatic Load (AL). Here we propose a comprehensive algorithm (ALCS) that integrates commonly used approaches to generate AL risk categories and assess associations to brain structure deterioration. In a cohort of cognitively normal mid-life adults (n = 620, age 51.3 ± 5.48 years), we developed a comprehensive composite for AL scoring incorporating gender and age differences, high quartile approach, clinical reference values, and current medications, to then generate AL risk categories. Compared to the empirical approach (ALES), ALCS showed better model fit criteria and a strong association with age and sex. ALSC categories were regressed against brain and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes. Higher AL risk categories were associated with increased total, periventricular, frontal, and left parietal WMH volumes, also showing better fit compared to ALES. When cardiovascular biomarkers were removed from the ALSC algorithm, only left-frontal WMHV remained associated with AL, revealing a strong vascular burden influencing the index. Our results agree with previous evidence and suggest that sustained stress exposure enhances brain deterioration in mid-life adults. Showing better fit than ALES, our comprehensive algorithm can provide a more accurate AL estimation to explore how stress exposure enhances age-related health decline.",2024,,Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; White Matter; Allostasis; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Buller-Peralta, I; Gregory, S; Low, A; Dounavi, ME; Bridgeman, K; Ntailianis, G; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Koychev, I; Malhotra, P; O'Brien, JT; Ritchie, CW; Muniz-Terrera, G"

Subject Harmonization of Digital Biomarkers: Improved Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the early stage of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a crucial stage for therapeutic interventions and treatment. Early detection of MCI offers opportunities for early intervention and significantly benefits cohort enrichment for clinical trials. Imaging and in vivo markers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have high detection performance, yet their prohibitive costs and intrusiveness demand more affordable and accessible alternatives. The recent advances in digital biomarkers, especially language markers, have shown great potential, where variables informative to MCI are derived from linguistic and/or speech and later used for predictive modeling. A major challenge in modeling language markers comes from the variability of how each person speaks. As the cohort size for language studies is usually small due to extensive data collection efforts, the variability among persons makes language markers hard to generalize to unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel subject harmonization tool to address the issue of distributional differences in language markers across subjects, thus enhancing the generalization performance of machine learning models. Our empirical results show that machine learning models built on our harmonized features have improved prediction performance on unseen data.

Advances of Genome Editing with CRISPR/Cas9 in Neurodegeneration: The Right Path towards Therapy.,"The rate of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) is rising rapidly as the world's population ages. Conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia are becoming more prevalent and are now the fourth leading cause of death, following heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Although modern diagnostic techniques for detecting NDDs are varied, scientists are continuously seeking new and improved methods to enable early and precise detection. In addition to that, the present treatment options are limited to symptomatic therapy, which is effective in reducing the progression of neurodegeneration but lacks the ability to target the root cause-progressive loss of neuronal functioning. As a result, medical researchers continue to explore new treatments for these conditions. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of the key features of NDDs and an overview of the underlying mechanisms of neuroimmune dysfunction. Additionally, we dive into the cutting-edge treatment options that gene therapy provides in the quest to treat these disorders.",2023,CRISPR/Cas9; adeno-associated virus; cellular senescence; genome editing; lentivirus; neurodegenerative disorders; neuroinflammation,,"Klinkovskij, A; Shepelev, M; Isaakyan, Y; Aniskin, D; Ulasov, I"

Method to determine whether sleep phenotypes are driven by endogenous circadian rhythms or environmental light by combining longitudinal data and personalised mathematical models.,"Sleep timing varies between individuals and can be altered in mental and physical health conditions. Sleep and circadian sleep phenotypes, including circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, may be driven by endogenous physiological processes, exogeneous environmental light exposure along with social constraints and behavioural factors. Identifying the relative contributions of these driving factors to different phenotypes is essential for the design of personalised interventions. The timing of the human sleep-wake cycle has been modelled as an interaction of a relaxation oscillator (the sleep homeostat), a stable limit cycle oscillator with a near 24-hour period (the circadian process), man-made light exposure and the natural light-dark cycle generated by the Earth's rotation. However, these models have rarely been used to quantitatively describe sleep at the individual level. Here, we present a new Homeostatic-Circadian-Light model (HCL) which is simpler, more transparent and more computationally efficient than other available models and is designed to run using longitudinal sleep and light exposure data from wearable sensors. We carry out a systematic sensitivity analysis for all model parameters and discuss parameter identifiability. We demonstrate that individual sleep phenotypes in each of 34 older participants (65-83y) can be described by feeding individual participant light exposure patterns into the model and fitting two parameters that capture individual average sleep duration and timing. The fitted parameters describe endogenous drivers of sleep phenotypes. We then quantify exogenous drivers using a novel metric which encodes the circadian phase dependence of the response to light. Combining endogenous and exogeneous drivers better explains individual mean mid-sleep (adjusted R-squared 0.64) than either driver on its own (adjusted R-squared 0.08 and 0.17 respectively). Critically, our model and analysis highlights that different people exhibiting the same sleep phenotype may have different driving factors and opens the door to personalised interventions to regularize sleep-wake timing that are readily implementable with current digital health technology.",2023,,"Humans; Sleep; Circadian Rhythm; Phenotype; Homeostasis; Models, Theoretical","Skeldon, AC; Rodriguez Garcia, T; Cleator, SF; Della Monica, C; Ravindran, KKG; Revell, VL; Dijk, DJ"

Resting-state EEG signatures of Alzheimer's disease are driven by periodic but not aperiodic changes.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasize the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",2024,Alzheimer's; Dementia; EEG; Oscillations,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Electroencephalography; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Rest,"Kopčanová, M; Tait, L; Donoghue, T; Stothart, G; Smith, L; Flores-Sandoval, AA; Davila-Perez, P; Buss, S; Shafi, MM; Pascual-Leone, A; Fried, PJ; Benwell, CSY"

Magnetic resonance image-based brain age as a discriminator of dementia conversion in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"Patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a conversion rate of approximately 10% to dementia within 2 years. We aimed to investigate whether brain age is an important factor in predicting conversion to dementia in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychological evaluation, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and [18F]-florbetaben positron emission tomography. Brain age was determined by the volumetric assessment of 12 distinct brain regions using an automatic segmentation software. During the follow-up period, 38% of the patients converted from amnestic MCI to dementia. Further, 73% of patients had a brain age greater than their actual chronological age. When defining 'survival' as the non-conversion of MCI to dementia, these groups differed significantly in survival probability (p = 0.036). The low-educated female group with a brain age greater than their actual age had the lowest survival rate among all groups. Our findings suggest that the MRI-based brain age used in this study can contribute to predicting conversion to dementia in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI.",2023,,"Humans; Female; Retrospective Studies; Disease Progression; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid; Neuropsychological Tests; Dementia; Alzheimer Disease","Kim, HW; Kim, HJ; Lee, H; Yang, H; Rieu, Z; Lee, JH"

Pupil responses to colorfulness are selectively reduced in healthy older adults.,"The alignment between visual pathway signaling and pupil dynamics offers a promising non-invasive method to further illuminate the mechanisms of human color perception. However, only limited research has been done in this area and the effects of healthy aging on pupil responses to the different color components have not been studied yet. Here we aim to address this by modelling the effects of color lightness and chroma (colorfulness) on pupil responses in young and older adults, in a closely controlled passive viewing experiment with 26 broad-spectrum digital color fields. We show that pupil responses to color lightness and chroma are independent from each other in both young and older adults. Pupil responses to color lightness levels are unaffected by healthy aging, when correcting for smaller baseline pupil sizes in older adults. Older adults exhibit weaker pupil responses to chroma increases, predominantly along the Green-Magenta axis, while relatively sparing the Blue-Yellow axis. Our findings complement behavioral studies in providing physiological evidence that colors fade with age, with implications for color-based applications and interventions both in healthy aging and later-life neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Pupil; Color Perception; Color,"van Leeuwen, JEP; McDougall, A; Mylonas, D; Suárez-González, A; Crutch, SJ; Warren, JD"
LETHE: A Digital Intervention for Cognitive Decline.,"Dementia is the main cause of disability in elderly populations. It has been shown that the risk factors of dementia are a mixture of pathological, lifestyle and heritable factors, with some of those being provably modifiable. Early diagnosis of dementia and approaches to slow down its evolution are currently the most prominent management methodologies due to lack of a cure. For that reason, a plethora of home-based assistive technologies for dementia management do exist, with most of them focusing on the improvement of memory and thinking. The main objective of LETHE is prevention in the whole spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly population at risk reaching from asymptomatic to subjective or mild cognitive impairment to prodromal Dementia. LETHE will provide a Big Data collection platform and analysis system, that will allow prevention, personalized risk detection and intervention on cognitive decline. Through the subsequent 2-year clinical trial, the LETHE system, as well as the respective knowledge gained will be evaluated and validated. The scope of the current paper is to introduce the LETHE study and its respective novel platform as a holistic approach to multidomain lifestyle intervention trial studies. The present work depicts the architectural perspective and extends beyond state-of-the-art guidelines and approaches to health management systems and cloud platform development.Clinical Relevance - Patient Management Systems as well as lifestyle management platforms have significant clinical relevance as they allow for remote and continuous monitoring of patients' health status. LETHE aims to improve patient outcomes by providing predictive models for cognitive decline and patient adherence to the multimodal lifestyle intervention, enabling prompt and appropriate medical decisions.",2023,,Aged; Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Health Behavior; Life Style; Risk Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies,"Loukas, VS; Kassiotis, T; Martinez, IL; Koumakis, L; Bruinsma, J; Pasciuti, R; Balatresi, M; Tenhunen, V; Fiakkas, A; Ataliani, L; Karanasiou, GS; Tsiknakis, M; Hilberger, H; Bodenler, M; Schnalzer, B; Huber, S; Pirani, M; Colombo, M; Hanke, S; Fotiadis, DI"
Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection with Machine Learning and Topological Data Analysis Applied to EEG Time-series in Facial Emotion Oddball Paradigm.,"We report a novel approach to dementia neurobiomarker development from EEG time series using topological data analysis (TDA) methodology and machine learning (ML) tools in the 'AI for social good' application domain, with possible following application to home-based point of care diagnostics and cognitive intervention monitoring. We propose a new approach to a digital dementia neurobiomarker for early-onset mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prognosis. We report the best median accuracies in a range of upper 85% linear discriminant analysis (LDA), as well above 90% for linear SVM and deep fully connected neural network classifier models in leave-one-out-subject cross-validation, which presents very encouraging results in a binary healthy cognitive aging versus MCI stages using TDA features applied to brainwave time series patterns captured from a four-channel EEG wearable.Clinical relevance- The reported study offers an objective dementia early onset neurobiomarker prospect to replace traditional subjective paper and pencil tests with an application of EEG-wearable-based and topological data analysis machine learning tools in a possibly successive home-based point-of-care environment.",2023,,Humans; Time Factors; Cognitive Dysfunction; Machine Learning; Emotions; Dementia; Electroencephalography,"Rutkowski, TM; Abe, MS; Sugimoto, H; Otake-Matsuura, M"
High-throughput target trial emulation for Alzheimer's disease drug repurposing with real-world data.,"Target trial emulation is the process of mimicking target randomized trials using real-world data, where effective confounding control for unbiased treatment effect estimation remains a main challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed for this challenge, a systematic evaluation is still lacking. Here we emulated trials for thousands of medications from two large-scale real-world data warehouses, covering over 10 years of clinical records for over 170 million patients, aiming to identify new indications of approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease. We assessed different propensity score models under the inverse probability of treatment weighting framework and suggested a model selection strategy for improved baseline covariate balancing. We also found that the deep learning-based propensity score model did not necessarily outperform logistic regression-based methods in covariate balancing. Finally, we highlighted five top-ranked drugs (pantoprazole, gabapentin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, and omeprazole) originally intended for other indications with potential benefits for Alzheimer's patients.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Drug Repositioning; Propensity Score; Atorvastatin,"Zang, C; Zhang, H; Xu, J; Zhang, H; Fouladvand, S; Havaldar, S; Cheng, F; Chen, K; Chen, Y; Glicksberg, BS; Chen, J; Bian, J; Wang, F"

A systematic review and narrative analysis of digital speech biomarkers in Motor Neuron Disease.,"Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a progressive and largely fatal neurodegeneritve disorder with a lifetime risk of approximately 1 in 300. At diagnosis, up to 25% of people with MND (pwMND) exhibit bulbar dysfunction. Currently, pwMND are assessed using clinical examination and diagnostic tools including the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALS-FRS(R)), a clinician-administered questionnaire with a single item on speech intelligibility. Here we report on the use of digital technologies to assess speech features as a marker of disease diagnosis and progression in pwMND. Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline and EMBASE were systematically searched. 40 studies were evaluated including 3670 participants; 1878 with a diagnosis of MND. 24 studies used microphones, 5 used smartphones, 6 used apps, 2 used tape recorders and 1 used the Multi-Dimensional Voice Programme (MDVP) to record speech samples. Data extraction and analysis methods varied but included traditional statistical analysis, CSpeech, MATLAB and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Speech features assessed also varied and included jitter, shimmer, fundamental frequency, intelligible speaking rate, pause duration and syllable repetition. Findings from this systematic review indicate that digital speech biomarkers can distinguish pwMND from healthy controls and can help identify bulbar involvement in pwMND. Preliminary evidence suggests digitally assessed acoustic features can identify more nuanced changes in those affected by voice dysfunction. No one digital speech biomarker alone is consistently able to diagnose or prognosticate MND. Further longitudinal studies involving larger samples are required to validate the use of these technologies as diagnostic tools or prognostic biomarkers.",2023,,,"Bowden, M; Beswick, E; Tam, J; Perry, D; Smith, A; Newton, J; Chandran, S; Watts, O; Pal, S"

Digital phenotyping: An equal opportunity approach to reducing disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"A rapidly aging world population is fueling a concomitant increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Scientific inquiry, however, has largely focused on White populations in Australia, the European Union, and North America. As such, there is an incomplete understanding of AD in other populations. In this perspective, we describe research efforts and challenges of cohort studies from three regions of the world: Central America, East Africa, and East Asia. These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

Application of machine learning in dementia diagnosis: A systematic literature review.,"According to the World Health Organization forecast, over 55 million people worldwide have dementia, and about 10 million new cases are detected yearly. Early diagnosis is essential for patients to plan for the future and deal with the disease. Machine Learning algorithms allow us to solve the problems associated with early disease detection. This work attempts to identify the current relevance of the application of machine learning in dementia prediction in the scientific world and suggests open fields for future research. The literature review was conducted by combining bibliometric and content analysis of articles originating in a period of 20 years in the Scopus database. Twenty-seven thousand five hundred twenty papers were identified firstly, of which a limited number focused on machine learning in dementia diagnosis. After the exclusion process, 202 were selected, and 25 were chosen for analysis. The recent increasing interest in the past five years in the theme of machine learning in dementia shows that it is a relevant field for research with still open questions. The methods used to identify dementia or what features are used to identify or predict this disease are explored in this study. The literature review revealed that most studies used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its types as the main feature, accompanied by demographic data such as age, gender, and the mini-mental state examination score (MMSE). Data are usually acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification of Alzheimer's disease is more prevalent than prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or their combination. The authors preferred machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Ensemble methods, and CNN because of their excellent performance and results in previous studies. However, most use not one machine-learning technique but a combination of techniques. Despite achieving good results in the studies considered, there are new concepts for future investigation declared by the authors and suggestions for improvements by employing promising methods with potentially significant results.",2023,0000; 1111; Alzheimer's disease; Dementia; Machine learning; Neurodegenerative diseases,,"Kantayeva, G; Lima, J; Pereira, AI"

TANGO: a placebo-controlled randomized phase 2 study of efficacy and safety of the anti-tau monoclonal antibody gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease, the spread of aberrantly phosphorylated tau is an important criterion in the Braak staging of disease severity and correlates with disease symptomatology. Here, we report the results of TANGO ( NCT03352557 ), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and multiple-dose long-term trial of gosuranemab-a monoclonal antibody to N-terminal tau-in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of gosuranemab compared to placebo. The secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of multiple doses of gosuranemab in slowing cognitive and functional impairment (using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores at week 78) and evaluate the immunogenicity of gosuranemab (using the incidence of anti-gosuranemab antibody responses). Participants were randomized (n = 654); received (n = 650) low-dose (125 mg once every 4 weeks (q4w), n = 58; 375 mg q12w, n = 58), intermediate-dose (600 mg q4w, n = 106) or high-dose (2,000 mg q4w, n = 214) gosuranemab or placebo (q4w, n = 214) intravenously for 78 weeks; and assigned to cerebrospinal fluid (n = 327) and/or tau positron emission tomography (n = 357) biomarker substudies. Gosuranemab had an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated (incidence of serious adverse events: placebo, 12.1%; low dose, 10.3%; intermediate dose, 12.3%; high dose, 11.7%). The incidence of treatment-emergent gosuranemab antibody responses was low at all time points. No significant effects were identified in cognitive and functional tests as no dose resulted in a favorable change from the baseline CDR-SB score at week 78 compared to placebo control (adjusted mean change: placebo, 1.85; low dose, 2.20; intermediate dose, 2.24; high dose, 1.85).

"Preclinical Studies of Canagliflozin, a Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitor, and Donepezil Combined Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease.","The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), is continuously growing worldwide, which leads to a heavy economic and societal burden. The lack of a safe and effective causal therapy in cognitive decline is an aggravating factor and requires investigations into the repurposing of commonly used drugs. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new and efficient class of hypoglycemic drugs and, due to their pleiotropic effects, have indications that go beyond diabetes. There is emerging data from murine studies that SGLT2i can cross the blood-brain barrier and may have neuroprotective effects, such as increasing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), reducing the amyloid burden, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and restoring the circadian rhythm in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. The current study investigates the effect of an SGLT2i and donepezil, under a separate or combined 21-day treatment on AD-relevant behaviors and brain pathology in mice. The SGLT2i canagliflozin was found to significantly improve the novelty preference index and the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the maze in the novel object recognition and elevated plus maze test, respectively. In addition, canagliflozin therapy decreased AChE activity, mTOR and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. The results also recorded the acetylcholine M1 receptor in canagliflozin-treated mice compared to the scopolamine group. In the hippocampus, the SGLT2i canagliflozin reduced the microgliosis and astrogliosis in males, but not in female mice. These findings emphasize the value of SGLT2i in clinical practice. By inhibiting AChE activity, canagliflozin represents a compound that resembles AD-registered therapies in this respect, supporting the need for further evaluation in dementia clinical trials.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; SGLT2i; acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; canagliflozin; donepezil; mTOR,,"Stanciu, GD; Ababei, DC; Solcan, C; Bild, V; Ciobica, A; Beschea Chiriac, SI; Ciobanu, LM; Tamba, BI"
IC3 protocol: a longitudinal observational study of cognition after stroke using novel digital health technology.,"Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, frequently resulting in persistent cognitive deficits among survivors. These deficits negatively impact recovery and therapy engagement, and their treatment is consistently rated as high priority by stakeholders and clinicians. Although clinical guidelines endorse cognitive screening for poststroke management, there is currently no gold-standard approach for identifying cognitive deficits after stroke, and clinical stroke services lack the capacity for long-term cognitive monitoring and care.

Assessing processing speed and its neural correlates in the three variants of primary progressive aphasia with a non-verbal tablet-based task.,"Prior research has revealed distinctive patterns of impaired language abilities across the three variants of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA): nonfluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA), logopenic (lvPPA) and semantic (svPPA). However, little is known about whether, and to what extent, non-verbal cognitive abilities, such as processing speed, are impacted in PPA patients. This is because neuropsychological tests typically contain linguistic stimuli and require spoken output, being therefore sensitive to verbal deficits in aphasic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in processing speed between PPA patients and healthy controls, and among the three PPA variants, using a brief non-verbal tablet-based task (Match) modeled after the WAIS-III digit symbol coding test, and to determine its neural correlates. Here, we compared performance on the Match task between PPA patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 59) and across the three PPA variants. We correlated performance on Match with voxelwise gray and white matter volumes. We found that lvPPA and nfvPPA patients performed significantly worse on Match than healthy controls and svPPA patients. Worse performance on Match across PPA patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in specific parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus, and reduced white matter volume in the left parietal lobe. To conclude, our behavioral findings reveal that processing speed is differentially impacted across the three PPA variants and provide support for the potential clinical utility of a tabled-based task (Match) to assess non-verbal cognition. In addition, our neuroimaging findings confirm the importance of a set of fronto-parietal regions that previous research has associated with processing speed and executive control. Finally, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings combined indicate that differences in processing speed are largely explained by the unequal distribution of atrophy in these fronto-parietal regions across the three PPA variants.",2024,Digital assessment; Fronto-parietal regions; Primary progressive aphasia; Processing speed,"Humans; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Processing Speed; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gray Matter; Cerebral Cortex","Gajardo-Vidal, A; Montembeault, M; Lorca-Puls, DL; Licata, AE; Bogley, R; Erlhoff, S; Ratnasiri, B; Ezzes, Z; Battistella, G; Tsoy, E; Pereira, CW; DeLeon, J; Tee, BL; Henry, ML; Miller, ZA; Rankin, KP; Mandelli, ML; Possin, KL; Gorno-Tempini, ML"
Recent Research Progress in Fluorescent Probes for Detection of Amyloid-β In Vivo.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Due to its complex pathological mechanism, its etiology is not yet clear. As one of the main pathological markers of AD, amyloid-β (Aβ) plays an important role in the development of AD. The deposition of Aβ is not only related to the degeneration of neurons, but also can activate a series of pathological events, including the activation of astrocytes and microglia, the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and the change in microcirculation, which is the main cause of brain lesions and death in AD patients. Therefore, the development of efficient and reliable Aβ-specific probes is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD. This paper focuses on reviewing the application of small-molecule fluorescent probes in Aβ imaging in vivo in recent years. These probes efficiently map the presence of Aβ in vivo, providing a pathway for the early diagnosis of AD and providing enlightenment for the design of Aβ-specific probes in the future.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); amyloid-β (Aβ); bioimaging; fluorescent probe,Humans; Fluorescent Dyes; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease,"Zhang, ZY; Li, ZJ; Tang, YH; Xu, L; Zhang, DT; Qin, TY; Wang, YL"

Multi-omics data reveals aberrant gut microbiota-host glycerophospholipid metabolism in association with neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice.,"Numerous studies have described the notable impact of gut microbiota on the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) via the gut - brain axis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of gut microbiota in the development of AD are limited. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms of gut microbiota in AD by integrating multi-omics data. In this study, APP/PS1 and WT mice at nine months of age were used as study mouse model. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test. The levels of Aβ plaque and neuroinflammation in the brain were detected using immunofluorescence and PET/CT. In addition, we not only used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics to explore the variation characteristics of gut microbiota and serum metabolism abundance, but also combined spatial metabolomics and transcriptomics to explore the change in the brain and identify their potential correlation. APP/PS1 mice showed significant cognitive impairment and amyloid-β deposits in the brain.

Chronic Health Conditions and Patient Portal Use in Caregivers of People With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.,"This study aimed to investigate both chronic health conditions and the utilization of patient portals, focusing particularly on caregivers responsible for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Data from the Health Information National Trends Survey 2018-2020 were analyzed, involving a sample of 304 family and unpaid caregivers of individuals with ADRD. Among caregivers of individuals with ADRD, 77.6% had at least one chronic disease. A significant proportion (46.6%) of ADRD caregivers had never accessed their patient portals. The limited utilization of patient portals among caregivers responsible for individuals with ADRD, particularly those with lower education, advanced age, and few chronic conditions, becomes apparent due to challenges associated with digital literacy and discomfort with computers. Recognizing the crucial role caregivers play for individuals with ADRD and their health risks, there's a need for tailored training to enhance their health management skills and caregiving capabilities.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias; caregiver; chronic disease; patient portal; self-management,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Caregivers; Patient Portals; Chronic Disease,"Oh, KM; Inoue, M; Koizumi, N; Beran, K; Lee, JA"
Neuropsychiatric disturbances in mild cognitive impairment: A scientometric analysis.,"Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have been extensively studied in dementia than its prodromal stage, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A scientometric study on BPSD in MCI would be valuable in synthesizing the existing body of research and providing insights into the trends, networks, and influencers within this area. We searched for related literature in the Web of Science database and extracted complete text and citation records of each publication. The primary objective was to map the research evolution of BPSD in MCI and highlight dominant research themes. The secondary objective was to identify research network characteristics (authors, journals, countries, and institutions) and abundances. A total of 12,369 studies published between 1980 and 2022 were included in the analysis. We found 51 distinct clusters from the co-cited reference network that were highly credible with significant modularity (Q = 0.856) and silhouette scores (S = 0.932). Five major research domains were identified: symptoms, diagnosis, brain substrates, biochemical pathways, and interventions. In recent years, the research focus in this area has been on gut microbiota, e-health, COVID-19, cognition, and delirium.

Gut inflammation associated with age and Alzheimer's disease pathology: a human cohort study.,"Age-related disease may be mediated by low levels of chronic inflammation (""inflammaging""). Recent work suggests that gut microbes can contribute to inflammation via degradation of the intestinal barrier. While aging and age-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) are linked to altered microbiome composition and higher levels of gut microbial components in systemic circulation, the role of intestinal inflammation remains unclear. To investigate whether greater gut inflammation is associated with advanced age and AD pathology, we assessed fecal samples from older adults to measure calprotectin, an established marker of intestinal inflammation which is elevated in diseases of gut barrier integrity.

Employing Deep-Learning Approach for the Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Transitions through the Analysis of Digital Biomarkers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the precursor to the advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it is important to detect the transition to the MCI condition as early as possible. Trends in daily routines/activities provide a measurement of cognitive/functional status, particularly in older adults. In this study, activity data from longitudinal monitoring through in-home ambient sensors are leveraged in predicting the transition to the MCI stage at a future time point. The activity dataset from the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) includes measures representing various domains such as walk, sleep, etc. Each sensor-captured activity measure is constructed as a time series, and a variety of summary statistics is computed. The similarity between one individual's activity time series and that of the remaining individuals is also computed as distance measures. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is trained with time series statistics and distance measures for the prediction modeling, and performance is evaluated by classification accuracy. The model outcomes are explained using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. LSTM model trained using the time series statistics and distance measures outperforms other modeling scenarios, including baseline classifiers, with an overall prediction accuracy of 83.84%. SHAP values reveal that sleep-related features contribute the most to the prediction of the cognitive stage at the future time point, and this aligns with the findings in the literature. Findings from this study not only demonstrate that a practical, less expensive, longitudinal monitoring of older adults' activity routines can benefit immensely in modeling AD progression but also unveil the most contributing features that are medically applicable and meaningful.",2023,AD progression; MCI transition; RNN LSTM; daily activities; deep learning; digital biomarkers; time series statistic,Humans; Aged; Deep Learning; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Aging,"Narasimhan, R; Gopalan, M; Sikkandar, MY; Alassaf, A; AlMohimeed, I; Alhussaini, K; Aleid, A; Sheik, SB"

High-throughput digital quantification of Alzheimer disease pathology and associated infrastructure in large autopsy studies.,"High-throughput digital pathology offers considerable advantages over traditional semiquantitative and manual methods of counting pathology. We used brain tissue from 5 clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging; the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, the Minority Aging Research Study, the African American Clinical Core, and the Latino Core to (1) develop a workflow management system for digital pathology processes, (2) optimize digital algorithms to quantify Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, and (3) harmonize data statistically. Data from digital algorithms for the quantification of β-amyloid (Aβ, n = 413) whole slide images and tau-tangles (n = 639) were highly correlated with manual pathology data (r = 0.83 to 0.94). Measures were robust and reproducible across different magnifications and repeated scans. Digital measures for Aβ and tau-tangles across multiple brain regions reproduced established patterns of correlations, even when samples were stratified by clinical diagnosis. Finally, we harmonized newly generated digital measures with historical measures across multiple large autopsy-based studies. We describe a multidisciplinary approach to develop a digital pathology pipeline that reproducibly identifies AD neuropathologies, Aβ load, and tau-tangles.

Learning Spatio-Temporal Model of Disease Progression With NeuralODEs From Longitudinal Volumetric Data.,"Robust forecasting of the future anatomical changes inflicted by an ongoing disease is an extremely challenging task that is out of grasp even for experienced healthcare professionals. Such a capability, however, is of great importance since it can improve patient management by providing information on the speed of disease progression already at the admission stage, or it can enrich the clinical trials with fast progressors and avoid the need for control arms by the means of digital twins. In this work, we develop a deep learning method that models the evolution of age-related disease by processing a single medical scan and providing a segmentation of the target anatomy at a requested future point in time. Our method represents a time-invariant physical process and solves a large-scale problem of modeling temporal pixel-level changes utilizing NeuralODEs. In addition, we demonstrate the approaches to incorporate the prior domain-specific constraints into our method and define temporal Dice loss for learning temporal objectives. To evaluate the applicability of our approach across different age-related diseases and imaging modalities, we developed and tested the proposed method on the datasets with 967 retinal OCT volumes of 100 patients with Geographic Atrophy and 2823 brain MRI volumes of 633 patients with Alzheimer's Disease. For Geographic Atrophy, the proposed method outperformed the related baseline models in the atrophy growth prediction.

Neuroanatomical and cellular degeneration associated with a social disorder characterized by new ritualistic belief systems in a TDP-C patient vs. a Pick patient.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a spectrum of clinically and pathologically heterogenous neurodegenerative dementias. Clinical and anatomical variants of FTD have been described and associated with underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology, including tauopathies (FTLD-tau) or TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). FTD patients with predominant degeneration of anterior temporal cortices often develop a language disorder of semantic knowledge loss and/or a social disorder often characterized by compulsive rituals and belief systems corresponding to predominant left or right hemisphere involvement, respectively. The neural substrates of these complex social disorders remain unclear. Here, we present a comparative imaging and postmortem study of two patients, one with FTLD-TDP (subtype C) and one with FTLD-tau (subtype Pick disease), who both developed new rigid belief systems. The FTLD-TDP patient developed a complex set of values centered on positivity and associated with specific physical and behavioral features of pigs, while the FTLD-tau patient developed compulsive, goal-directed behaviors related to general themes of positivity and spirituality. Neuroimaging showed left-predominant temporal atrophy in the FTLD-TDP patient and right-predominant frontotemporal atrophy in the FTLD-tau patient. Consistent with antemortem cortical atrophy, histopathologic examinations revealed severe loss of neurons and myelin predominantly in the anterior temporal lobes of both patients, but the FTLD-tau patient showed more bilateral, dorsolateral involvement featuring greater pathology and loss of projection neurons and deep white matter. These findings highlight that the regions within and connected to anterior temporal lobes may have differential vulnerability to distinct FTLD proteinopathies and serve important roles in human belief systems.",2023,Pick disease; TDP-C; anterior temporal lobe; behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; cortical layers; primary progressive aphasia; semantic knowledge; social cognition,,"Ohm, DT; Rhodes, E; Bahena, A; Capp, N; Lowe, M; Sabatini, P; Trotman, W; Olm, CA; Phillips, J; Prabhakaran, K; Rascovsky, K; Massimo, L; McMillan, C; Gee, J; Tisdall, MD; Yushkevich, PA; Lee, EB; Grossman, M; Irwin, DJ"

Small Molecule Pytren-4QMn Metal Complex Slows down Huntington's Disease Progression in Male zQ175 Transgenic Mice.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder considered a rare disease with a prevalence of 5.7 per 100,000 people. It is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation consisting of expansions of trinucleotide repeats that translate into poly-glutamine enlarged mutant huntingtin proteins (mHTT), which are particularly deleterious in brain tissues. Since there is no cure for this progressive fatal disease, searches for new therapeutic approaches are much needed. The small molecule pytren-4QMn (4QMn), a highly water-soluble mimic of the enzyme superoxide dismutase, has shown in vivo beneficial anti-inflammatory activity in mice and was able to remove mHTT deposits in a C. elegans model of HD. In this study, we assessed 4QMn therapeutic potential in zQ175 neo-deleted knock-in mice, a model of HD that closely mimics the heterozygosity, genetic injury, and progressive nature of the human disease. We provide evidence that 4QMn has good acute and chronic tolerability, and can cross the blood-brain barrier, and in male, but not female, zQ175 mice moderately ameliorate HD-altered gene expression, mHtt aggregation, and HD disease phenotype. Our data highlight the importance of considering sex-specific differences when testing new therapies using animal models and postulate 4QMn as a potential novel type of small water-soluble metal complex that could be worth further investigating for its therapeutic potential in HD, as well as in other polyglutamine diseases.",2023,4QMn; Huntington’s disease; Mn (II) complexes; Q175 mice; polyglutamine diseases; sex differences,"Female; Mice; Humans; Male; Animals; Mice, Transgenic; Huntington Disease; Caenorhabditis elegans; Disease Models, Animal; Water; Huntingtin Protein","Merino, M; González, S; Tronch, MC; Sánchez-Sánchez, AV; Clares, MP; García-España, A; García-España, E; Mullor, JL"

Community-Engaged Research (e.g., equitable community/science partnerships) is an evidence-based approach for improving engagement of underrepresented populations into Alzheimer's Disease research, but has lacked scalability to the national level. As internet use among older adults from underrepresented populations continues to grow, internet-based research shows promise as a feasible, valid approach to engagement and longitudinal assessment.

Artificial sharp-wave-ripples to support memory and counter neurodegeneration.,"Information processed in our sensory neocortical areas is transported to the hippocampus during memory encoding, and between hippocampus and neocortex during memory consolidation, and retrieval. Short bursts of high-frequency oscillations, so called sharp-wave-ripples, have been proposed as a potential mechanism for this information transfer: They can synchronize neural activity to support the formation of local neural networks to store information, and between distant cortical sites to act as a bridge to transfer information between sensory cortical areas and hippocampus. In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease, different neuropathological processes impair normal neural functioning and neural synchronization as well as sharp-wave-ripples, which impairs consolidation and retrieval of information, and compromises memory. Here, we formulate a new hypothesis, that artificially inducing sharp-wave-ripples with noninvasive high-frequency visual stimulation could potentially support memory functioning, as well as target the neuropathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases. We also outline key challenges for empirical tests of the hypothesis.",2024,Alzheimer; Gamma; High-Frequency; Hippocampus; Neocortex; Oscillation; Ripple; Theta,Humans; Hippocampus; Neocortex; Parietal Lobe; Memory Consolidation; Alzheimer Disease,"Keil, J; Kiiski, H; Doherty, L; Hernandez-Urbina, V; Vassiliou, C; Dean, C; Müschenich, M; Bahmani, H"

Digital behavioural signatures reveal trans-diagnostic clusters of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients.,"The current neuropsychiatric nosological categories underlie pragmatic treatment choice, regulation and clinical research but does not encompass biological rationale. However, subgroups of patients suffering from schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease have more in common than the neuropsychiatric nature of their condition, such as the expression of social dysfunction. The PRISM project presents here initial quantitative biological insights allowing the first steps toward a novel trans-diagnostic classification of psychiatric and neurological symptomatology intended to reinvigorate drug discovery in this area. In this study, we applied spectral clustering on digital behavioural endpoints derived from passive smartphone monitoring data in a subgroup of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as age matched healthy controls, as part of the PRISM clinical study. This analysis provided an objective social functioning characterization with three differential clusters that transcended initial diagnostic classification and was shown to be linked to quantitative neurobiological parameters assessed. This emerging quantitative framework will both offer new ways to classify individuals in biologically homogenous clusters irrespective of their initial diagnosis, and also offer insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these clusters.",2024,Behaviour; Clustering analysis; Digital phenotyping; Neuro-imaging; Neurology; Psychiatry,Humans; Schizophrenia; Alzheimer Disease,"Kas, MJH; Jongs, N; Mennes, M; Penninx, BWJH; Arango, C; van der Wee, N; Winter-van Rossum, I; Ayuso-Mateos, JL; Bilderbeck, AC; l'Hostis, P; Beckmann, CF; Dawson, GR; Sommer, B; Marston, HM"
Digital Marker for Early Screening of Mild Cognitive Impairment Through Hand and Eye Movement Analysis in Virtual Reality Using Machine Learning: First Validation Study.,"With the global rise in Alzheimer disease (AD), early screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a preclinical stage of AD, is of paramount importance.

Non-invasive temporal interference electrical stimulation of the human hippocampus.,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) via implanted electrodes is used worldwide to treat patients with severe neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, its invasiveness precludes widespread clinical use and deployment in research. Temporal interference (TI) is a strategy for non-invasive steerable DBS using multiple kHz-range electric fields with a difference frequency within the range of neural activity. Here we report the validation of the non-invasive DBS concept in humans. We used electric field modeling and measurements in a human cadaver to verify that the locus of the transcranial TI stimulation can be steerably focused in the hippocampus with minimal exposure to the overlying cortex. We then used functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral experiments to show that TI stimulation can focally modulate hippocampal activity and enhance the accuracy of episodic memories in healthy humans.

Alteration of Neural Network and Hippocampal Slice Activation through Exosomes Derived from 5XFAD Nasal Lavage Fluid.,"Exosomes, key mediators of intercellular transmission of pathogenic proteins, such as amyloid-beta and tau, significantly influence the progression and exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Present in a variety of biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, saliva, and nasal lavage fluid (NLF), exosomes underscore their potential as integral mediators of AD pathology. By serving as vehicles for disease-specific molecules, exosomes could unveil valuable insights into disease identification and progression. This study emphasizes the imperative to investigate the impacts of exosomes on neural networks to enhance our comprehension of intracerebral neuronal communication and its implications for neurological disorders like AD. After harvesting exosomes derived from NLF of 5XFAD mice, we utilized a high-density multielectrode array (HD-MEA) system, the novel technology enabling concurrent recordings from thousands of neurons in primary cortical neuron cultures and organotypic hippocampal slices. The ensuing results revealed a surge in neuronal firing rates and disoriented neural connectivity, reflecting the effects provoked by pathological amyloid-beta oligomer treatment. The local field potentials in the exosome-treated hippocampal brain slices also exhibited aberrant rhythmicity, along with an elevated level of current source density. While this research is an initial exploration, it highlights the potential of exosomes in modulating neural networks under AD conditions and endorses the HD-MEA as an efficacious tool for exosome studies.",2023,5XFAD; exosome; high-density multielectrode array; hippocampal slice; nasal lavage fluid; neural network,Mice; Animals; Exosomes; Nasal Lavage Fluid; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Hippocampus,"Kim, S; Jeon, J; Ganbat, D; Kim, T; Shin, K; Hong, S; Hong, J"

Detecting value(s): Digital biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and the valuation of new diagnostic technologies.,"This article explores how the meanings and values of diagnosis are being reconfigured at the interface between technological innovation and imaginaries of precision medicine. From genome sequencing to biological and digital 'markers' of disease, technological innovation occupies an increasingly central space in the way we imagine future health and illness. These imaginaries are usually centred on the promise of faster, more precise and personalised diagnosis, and the associated hope that if detected early enough disease can be effectively treated and prevented. Underpinning and reproduced through these narratives of the future is a re-conceptualisation of diagnostic processes and categories around the anticipation of future risk, as noted by recent theoretical developments in the sociology of diagnosis and related disciplines. Adding to this literature, in this article we explore what makes these emerging diagnostic arrangements valuable, to whom and how. Drawing on interviews with experts involved in the development of digital biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, we trace how multiple and at times conflicting applications of the tools, and the value(s) attached to them, are coproduced. We thus ask what possibilities are pursued, or foreclosed, through the work of imagining the future of diagnosis.",2024,diagnosis; digital health; risk; screening; surveillance medicine,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Inventions; Precision Medicine; Sociology,"Costa, A; Milne, R"
T cell exhaustion is associated with cognitive status and amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Studies over the last 100 years have suggested a link between inflammation, infectious disease, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Understanding how the immune system changes during the development of AD may facilitate new treatments. Here, we studied an aging cohort who had been assessed for AD pathology with amyloid positron emission tomography and cognitive testing, and conducted high dimensional flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear and cerebrospinal fluid cells. Participants were assigned a classification of being amyloid negative cognitively normal, amyloid positive cognitively normal (APCN), or amyloid positive mild cognitive impairment (APMCI), an early stage of AD. We observed major alterations in the peripheral innate immune system including increased myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the blood of APMCI participants.

"Sense making in the wake of familial death: ""I continue to work through those feelings"".","Sense making is especially common in bereavement when a death challenges an individual's existing worldview. Thus, it is often discussed in the context of statistically atypical deaths, such as the death of a child or death by suicide, that are apt to create a crisis of meaning. Less understood is the process of sense making following more statistically normative deaths, such as those that occur in old age following prolonged illness. In this descriptive phenomenological study, researchers analyzed qualitative interviews and digital narratives created by six individuals who had experienced the death of an older family member with dementia, seeking to identify the essential nature of sense making during bereavement following so-called ""normal"" losses. Three themes (memorializing the whole person, reflecting on the caregiving experience, and emotional sense making) were identified, shedding light on this specific meaning making process among individuals representing a large and growing segment of the population.",2023,,,"Rolbiecki, AJ; Washington, KT; Holman, JG; Lee, JE"

Interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on trajectories of tau accumulation.,"Cerebrovascular pathology often co-exists with Alzheimer's disease pathology and can contribute to Alzheimer's disease-related clinical progression. However, the degree to which vascular burden contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathological progression is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on both baseline tau tangle load and longitudinal tau accumulation. We included 1229 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 Study, including cognitively unimpaired and impaired participants with and without biomarker-confirmed amyloid-β pathology. All underwent baseline tau-PET (18F-RO948), and a subset (n = 677) underwent longitudinal tau-PET after 2.5 ± 1.0 years. Tau-PET uptake was computed for a temporal meta-region-of-interest. We focused on four main vascular imaging features and risk factors: microbleeds; white matter lesion volume; stroke-related events (infarcts, lacunes and haemorrhages); and the Framingham Heart Study Cardiovascular Disease risk score. To validate our in vivo results, we examined 1610 autopsy cases from an Arizona-based neuropathology cohort on three main vascular pathological features: cerebral amyloid angiopathy; white matter rarefaction; and infarcts. For the in vivo cohort, primary analyses included age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear mixed models between tau-PET (outcome) and interactions between time, amyloid-β and each vascular feature (predictors). For the neuropathology cohort, age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear models between tau tangle density (outcome) and an interaction between plaque density and each vascular feature (predictors) were performed. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we observed a significant interaction between microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology on greater baseline tau load (β = 0.68, P < 0.001) and longitudinal tau accumulation (β = 0.11, P < 0.001). For white matter lesion volume, we did not observe a significant independent interaction effect with amyloid-β on tau after accounting for microbleeds. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we further found that stroke-related events showed a significant negative interaction with amyloid-β on longitudinal tau (β = -0.08, P < 0.001). In cognitively impaired individuals, there were no significant interaction effects between cerebrovascular and amyloid-β pathology at all. In the neuropathology dataset, the in vivo observed interaction effects between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and plaque density (β = 0.38, P < 0.001) and between infarcts and plaque density (β = -0.11, P = 0.005) on tau tangle density were replicated. To conclude, we demonstrated that cerebrovascular pathology-in the presence of amyloid-β pathology-modifies tau accumulation in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, the co-occurrence of microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology was associated with greater accumulation of tau aggregates during early disease stages. This opens the possibility that interventions targeting microbleeds may attenuate the rate of tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; tau; vascular burden; vascular risk,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Stroke; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Plaque, Amyloid; Infarction; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Apolipoproteins E","Coomans, EM; van Westen, D; Binette, AP; Strandberg, O; Spotorno, N; Serrano, GE; Beach, TG; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Ossenkoppele, R; Hansson, O"
The efficacy and practicality of the Neurotrack Cognitive Battery assessment for utilization in clinical settings for the identification of cognitive decline in an older Japanese population.,"Japan has the largest aging population with 33% of the population over the age of 60 years.

A number of traditional and digital cognitive assessments are also available, but many of these tests are time-consuming, taxing to the user, and not widely scalable. The purpose of this study was to incorporate a digital cognitive assessment battery into a standard clinical assessment performed within a Japanese-based neuropsychology clinic to assess the diagnostic accuracy and the relationship between the digital Neurotrack Cognitive Assessment Battery (N-CAB) to traditional cognitive assessments.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Neurotrack; cognitive assessment; cognitive decline; dementia,,"Glenn, JM; Bryk, K; Myers, JR; Anderson, J; Onguchi, K; McFarlane, J; Ozaki, S"
Together yet apart: Rethinking creativity and relational dementia care during the Covid-19 pandemic.,"Culture Box was a creative project that responded to deprivation and distress experienced by those with dementia in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote and digital creative activities were designed and delivered as 'Culture Boxes' to care homes, aiming to alleviate social isolation and loneliness for people with dementia. Eighty-eight people with dementia and 33 care staff from 33 care homes across England were recruited to the study, with 68 people with dementia and 28 staff completing the study 12 months later. Participatory Action Research combining mixed methods was used to evaluate the project. Baseline and follow-up surveys and dialogic interviews at 3 time points during the study collected quantitative and qualitative data and were analysed descriptively and via inductive thematic analysis respectively. Qualitative findings indicated that the project activities facilitated relational care through creative experiences characterised by sharing, building relationships, and developing a sense of community. Social health was promoted via participation in social activities and fostering independence. Future studies should further explore the utility of creative practices to develop relational care, to support care staff, and to maximise wellbeing benefits for those living with dementia.",2023,COVID-19 pandemic; Creativity; Dementia; Relational care; social health,Humans; Dementia; Pandemics; COVID-19; Research Design; England,"Tischler, V; Zeilig, H; O'Malley, M; Asker, C"

Classification of Alzheimer's disease stages from magnetic resonance images using deep learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive type of dementia characterized by loss of memory and other cognitive abilities, including speech. Since AD is a progressive disease, detection in the early stages is essential for the appropriate care of the patient throughout its development, going from asymptomatic to a stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then progressing to dementia and severe dementia; is worth mentioning that everyone suffers from cognitive impairment to some degree as we age, but the relevant task here is to identify which people are most likely to develop AD. Along with cognitive tests, evaluation of the brain morphology is the primary tool for AD diagnosis, where atrophy and loss of volume of the frontotemporal lobe are common features in patients who suffer from the disease. Regarding medical imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are one of the methods used by specialists to assess brain morphology. Recently, with the rise of deep learning (DL) and its successful implementation in medical imaging applications, it is of growing interest in the research community to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems that can help physicians to detect this disease, especially in the early stages where macroscopic changes are not so easily identified. This article presents a DL-based approach to classifying MRI scans in the different stages of AD, using a curated set of images from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies databases. Our methodology involves image pre-processing using FreeSurfer, spatial data-augmentation operations, such as rotation, flip, and random zoom during training, and state-of-the-art 3D convolutional neural networks such as EfficientNet, DenseNet, and a custom siamese network, as well as the relatively new approach of vision transformer architecture. With this approach, the best detection percentage among all four architectures was around 89% for AD ",2023,Computer-aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Digital image processing; Supervised learning,,"Mora-Rubio, A; Bravo-Ortíz, MA; Quiñones Arredondo, S; Saborit Torres, JM; Ruz, GA; Tabares-Soto, R"

Assessing individual variability of the entorhinal subfields in health and disease.,"Investigating interindividual variability is a major field of interest in neuroscience. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is essential for memory and affected early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We combined histology ground-truth data with ultrahigh-resolution 7T ex vivo MRI to analyze EC interindividual variability in 3D. Further, we characterized (1) entorhinal shape as a whole, (2) entorhinal subfield range and midpoints, and (3) subfield architectural location and tau burden derived from 3D probability maps. Our results indicated that EC shape varied but was not related to demographic or disease factors at this preclinical stage. The medial intermediate subfield showed the highest degree of location variability in the probability maps. However, individual subfields did not display the same level of variability across dimensions and outcome measure, each providing a different perspective. For example, the olfactory subfield showed low variability in midpoint location in the superior-inferior dimension but high variability in anterior-posterior, and the subfield entorhinal intermediate showed a large variability in volumetric measures but a low variability in location derived from the 3D probability maps. These findings suggest that interindividual variability within the entorhinal subfields requires a 3D approach incorporating multiple outcome measures. This study provides 3D probability maps of the individual entorhinal subfields and respective tau pathology in the preclinical stage (Braak I and II) of AD. These probability maps illustrate the subfield average and may serve as a checkpoint for future modeling.",2023,MRI; histology; phosphorylated tau; three-dimensional; validation,Humans; Hippocampus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Entorhinal Cortex; Alzheimer Disease,"Oltmer, J; Greve, DN; Cerri, S; Slepneva, N; Llamas-Rodríguez, J; Iglesias, JE; Van Leemput, K; Champion, SN; Frosch, MP; Augustinack, JC"

The FNAME was administered to 257 participants across the clinical spectrum with 122 having amyloid biomarkers. Linear regression explored the association between demographics and FNAME and between amyloid (+/-) groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) identified performance thresholds that best discriminated between biomarker (+/-) individuals. Lower FNAME scores occurred in males, older ages, Black/African Americans, Hispanics, and biomarker-positive participants. ROC analyses demonstrated acceptable accuracy (0.73 to 0.77) but only when combined with clinical status.

TIHM: An open dataset for remote healthcare monitoring in dementia.,"Dementia is a progressive condition that affects cognitive and functional abilities. There is a need for reliable and continuous health monitoring of People Living with Dementia (PLWD) to improve their quality of life and support their independent living. Healthcare services often focus on addressing and treating already established health conditions that affect PLWD. Managing these conditions continuously can inform better decision-making earlier for higher-quality care management for PLWD. The Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) project developed a new digital platform to routinely collect longitudinal, observational, and measurement data, within the home and apply machine learning and analytical models for the detection and prediction of adverse health events affecting the well-being of PLWD. This work describes the TIHM dataset collected during the second phase (i.e., feasibility study) of the TIHM project. The data was collected from homes of 56 PLWD and associated with events and clinical observations (daily activity, physiological monitoring, and labels for health-related conditions).

Dissociating memory and executive function impairment through temporal features in a word list verbal learning task.,"The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is an established verbal learning test commonly used to quantify memory impairments due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) both at a clinical dementia stage or prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Focal memory impairment-as quantified e.g. by the RAVLT-at an MCI stage is referred to as amnestic MCI (aMCI) and is often regarded as the cognitive phenotype of prodromal AD. However, recent findings suggest that not only learning and memory but also other cognitive domains, especially executive functions (EF) and processing speed (PS), influence verbal learning performance. This research investigates whether additional temporal features extracted from audio recordings from a participant's RAVLT response can better dissociate memory and EF in such tasks and eventually help to better describe MCI subtypes. 675 age-matched participants from the H70 Swedish birth cohort were included in this analysis; 68 participants were classified as MCI (33 aMCI and 35 due to executive impairment). RAVLT performances were recorded and temporal features extracted. Novel temporal features were correlated with established neuropsychological tests measuring EF and PS. Lastly, the downstream diagnostic potential of temporal features was estimated using group differences and a machine learning (ML) classification scenario. Temporal features correlated moderately with measures of EF and PS. Performance of an ML classifier could be improved by adding temporal features to traditional counts. We conclude that RAVLT temporal features are in general related to EF and that they might be capable of dissociating memory and EF in a word list learning task.",2023,Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; RAVLT; Speech analysis; Temporal analysis; aMCI; exMCI,,"Dörr, F; Schäfer, S; Öhman, F; Linz, N; Bodin, TH; Skoog, J; Zettergren, A; Kern, S; Skoog, I; Tröger, J"
Perceptions of Acute Care Telemedicine Among Caregivers for Persons Living with Dementia: A Qualitative Study.,"Persons living with dementia (PLWD) have high emergency department (ED) utilization. Little is known about using telemedicine with PLWD and caregivers as an alternative to ED visits for minor acute health problems. This qualitative interview-based study elicited caregivers' perspectives about the acceptability of telemedicine for acute complaints. We performed telephone interviews with 28 caregivers of PLWD from two academic EDs, one in the Northeast and another in the South. Using a combined deductive-inductive approach, we coded interview transcripts and elucidated common themes by consensus. All caregivers reported they would need to participate in the telemedicine visit to help overcome communication and digital literacy challenges. People from racial/ethnic minority groups reported lower comfort with the virtual format. In both sites, participants expressed uncertainty about illness severity that could preclude using telemedicine for acute complaints. Overall, respondents deemed acute care telemedicine acceptable, but caregivers describe specific roles as crucial intermediaries to facilitate virtual care.",2024,caregiving; dementia; geriatrics; technology,Humans; Caregivers; Dementia; Ethnicity; Minority Groups; Telemedicine,"Chary, A; Hernandez, N; Rivera, AP; Ramont, V; Obi, T; Santangelo, I; Ritchie, C; Singh, H; Hayden, E; Naik, AD; Liu, S; Kennedy, M"

Route sequence knowledge supports the formation of cognitive maps.,"In this study, we examined the extent to which knowledge about the sequence of places encountered during route learning supports the formation of a metric cognitive map. In a between subjects design, participants learned a route until they could navigate it independently without error whilst also learning information about either the identity of places along the route (Recognition Learning condition) or the sequence of places along the route (Sequence Learning condition). In a follow-up Reconstruction of Order Task, we confirmed that participants in the Sequence Learning condition had more accurate route sequence knowledge than those in the Recognition Learning condition, despite requiring the same overall number of trials to learn the route. Participants then completed a Pointing Task to assess the quality of their cognitive map of the environment. Both groups performed above chance level, showing incidental encoding of metric information, but the Sequence Learning group produced significantly lower pointing errors than the Recognition Learning group. Further, we found that route distance between pairs of places was a strong predictor of pointing error in both groups, whilst Euclidean distance between places was a significant, but weak, predictor only for the Sequence Learning condition. The results of this study demonstrate that discrete route sequence knowledge directly supports the formation of metric cognitive maps. We consider how the results are best explained by interactions between striatal route representations and hippocampal metric representations, centered around the sequence of places acting as a scaffold for the encoding of metric information.",2023,cognitive map; navigation; route learning; sequence memory,"Humans; Cognition; Space Perception; Learning; Learning Disabilities; Recognition, Psychology","Hilton, C; Wiener, J"
Single-label machine learning classification revealed some hidden but inter-related causes of five psychotic disorder diseases.,"Psychotic disorder diseases (PDD) or mental illnesses are group of illnesses that affect the minds and impair the cognitive ability, retard emotional ability and obstruct the process of communication and relationship with others and are characterized by delusions, hallucinations and disoriented or disordered pattern of thinking. Prognosis of PDD is not sufficient because of the nature of the diseases and as such adequate form of diagnosis is required to detect, manage and treat the illness. This paper applied the single-label classification (SLC) machine learning approach in mining of electronic health records of people with PDD in Nigeria using eleven independent (demographic) variables and five PDD as target variables. The five PDDs are Insomnia, Schizophrenia, Minimal Brain dysfunction (MBD), which is also known as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Vascular Dementia (VD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD). The aim of using SLC is that it would be easier to detect some PDDs that are related to each other without the loss of information, which is a plus over multi-label classification (MLC). ReliefF algorithm was used at each experiment to precipitate the order of importance of the independent variables and redundant variables were excluded from the analysis. The order of the variables in feature selection was matched with feature importance after the classifications and quantified using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The data was divided into: 70% for training and 30% for testing. Four new performance metrics adapted from the root mean square (RMSE) were proposed and used to measure the differences between the performance results of the 10 Machine learning models in terms of the training and testing and secondly, feature and without feature selection. The new metrics are close to zero which is an indication that the use of feature selection and cross validation may not greatly affects the accuracy of the SLC. When the PDDs are included as predictors for classifying others, there was a tremendous improvement as revealed by the four new metrics for classification accuracy (CA), precision and recall. Analysis of variance showed the four different metrics differs significantly for classification accuracy (CA) and precision. However, there were no significant difference between the CA and precision when the duo are compared together across the four evaluation metrics at p value less than 0.05.",2023,Classification; Diagnosis; Feature importance; Machine learning; Psychotic disorder; Single label approach,,"Okagbue, HI; Ijezie, OA; Ugwoke, PO; Adeyemi-Kayode, TM; Jonathan, O"

A two-step workflow based on plasma p-tau217 to screen for amyloid β positivity with further confirmatory testing only in uncertain cases.,"Cost-effective strategies for identifying amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity in patients with cognitive impairment are urgently needed with recent approvals of anti-Aβ immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood biomarkers can accurately detect AD pathology, but it is unclear whether their incorporation into a full diagnostic workflow can reduce the number of confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) tests needed while accurately classifying patients. We evaluated a two-step workflow for determining Aβ-PET status in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from two independent memory clinic-based cohorts (n = 348). A blood-based model including plasma tau protein 217 (p-tau217), age and APOE ε4 status was developed in BioFINDER-1 (area under the curve (AUC) = 89.3%) and validated in BioFINDER-2 (AUC = 94.3%). In step 1, the blood-based model was used to stratify the patients into low, intermediate or high risk of Aβ-PET positivity. In step 2, we assumed referral only of intermediate-risk patients to CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 testing, whereas step 1 alone determined Aβ-status for low- and high-risk groups. Depending on whether lenient, moderate or stringent thresholds were used in step 1, the two-step workflow overall accuracy for detecting Aβ-PET status was 88.2%, 90.5% and 92.0%, respectively, while reducing the number of necessary CSF tests by 85.9%, 72.7% and 61.2%, respectively. In secondary analyses, an adapted version of the BioFINDER-1 model led to successful validation of the two-step workflow with a different plasma p-tau217 immunoassay in patients with cognitive impairment from the TRIAD cohort (n = 84). In conclusion, using a plasma p-tau217-based model for risk stratification of patients with MCI can substantially reduce the need for confirmatory testing while accurately classifying patients, offering a cost-effective strategy to detect AD in memory clinic settings.",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Workflow; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Blood Proteins; Alzheimer Disease","Brum, WS; Cullen, NC; Janelidze, S; Ashton, NJ; Zimmer, ER; Therriault, J; Benedet, AL; Rahmouni, N; Tissot, C; Stevenson, J; Servaes, S; Triana-Baltzer, G; Kolb, HC; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Rosa-Neto, P; Blennow, K; Hansson, O"

Reduced body cell mass and functions in lower extremities are associated with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia.,"This study examined the alterations of segmental body composition in individuals with Alzheimer's pathology (AD), including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. A multifrequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA) was used to provide segmental water and impedance variables from 365 cognitively normal (CN), 123 MCI due to AD, and 30 AD dementia participants. We compared the BIA variables between the three groups, examined their correlations with neuropsychological screening test scores, and illustrate their 95% confidence RXc graphs. AD dementia participants were older, more depressive, and had worse cognitive abilities than MCI due to AD and CN participants. Although the BIA variables showed weak partial correlations with the cognitive test scores, we found patterns of an increasing water content in lean mass, increasing extra to intracellular water ratio, and decreasing reactance and phase angle in the lower extremities with effect sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.51 in the groups of MCI and dementia due to AD compared with CN individuals. The RXc graphs upheld the findings with a significant displacement downward and toward the right, dominantly in the lower extremities. Individuals with AD pathology exhibit a reduced body cell mass or cell strength, an abnormal cellular water distribution, and an overhydration status in lean mass, especially in the lower extremities.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Lower Extremity; Cognition; Water,"Doan, DNT; Kim, K; Ku, B; Lee, KH; Kim, JU"

Perceived barriers and solutions identified by healthcare professionals in utilizing web-based reminiscence therapy to support dementia care during the pandemic.,"This paper presents findings from a qualitative study conducted in Ontario, Canada, exploring healthcare professionals' perceptions of barriers and solutions for implementing Web-Based Reminiscence Therapy (WBRT) in an institutionalized settings for dementia care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study identified five major barriers, including the lack of on-boarding/educational training, need for technology availability and technical support, limited attention span of persons with dementia (PWD), availability of multi-sensory features, and time constraints due to staff workload. Seven major themes emerged related to proposed solutions/suggestions: (1) involving younger generations, (2) focusing on technology training, (3) integrating with other digital platforms, (4) adding narratives/descriptions to recollect memories, (5) ensuring accessibility, (6) adding QR codes for retrieving information, and (7) combining digital/traditional reminiscence methods. These findings provide valuable insights for implementing WBRT to facilitate dementia care and for the future refinement of its application.",2023,COVID-19 pandemic; Caregiving; Dementia care; Reminiscence therapy; Web-based application,Humans; Pandemics; Dementia; Health Personnel; Memory; Delivery of Health Care,"Akhter, R; Sun, W; Quevedo, AJU; Lemonde, M; Liscano, R; Horsburgh, S"
European Projects for Patients with Dementia and Their Caregivers.,"As we all know there is no treatment that can stop or delay the progression of dementia. The treatment we use is only symptomatic. EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) recommendations for dementia prevention by Sorbi et al. (2012) concluded that there is no treatment, no lifestyle, which could have an effect on prevention or delay of onset of different forms of dementia until today. The future studies in prevention must recruit younger people, larger sample, and for longer period. The last 10 years we have run, in collaboration with organizations in different European countries, many projects in order to support patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly patients with dementia and their caregivers. The first project was a 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe: predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS (Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe) study, an FP5 project with 1380 patients. Five studies were published. The second project was DESCRIPA study, an FP5 project to DEvelopment of Screening guidelines and clinical CRIteria for Predementia Alzheimer's disease, with 881 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). LLM (Long Lasting Memories) and VRADA (A virtual reality application for the exercise of dementia and Alzheimer patients) are two projects that include body and cognitive exercise for health for the elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment. The next is the RECAGE (REspectful Caring for the AGitated Elderly) project (Horizon 2020), a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. With six European universities we finished a very interesting FP6 project, the AddNeuroMed one, which gives even now information about the progression of normal elderly MCI and AD patients, in collaboration with other consortia. A very interesting Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project about digital biomarkers was entitled Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR project). The main goal of this project was the development and validation of technology-enabled, quantitative and sensitive measures of functional decline in people with early-stage AD. A running project is an Erasmus+ one in the higher education field, ""Genetic counseling in European universities: The case of neurodegenerative diseases"" (GECONEU project). The target of this study is to develop an online course for university students focusing on genetic counseling, and support people and society to better understand the aims of genetic testing and the usefulness of genetic counseling by involving students in an innovative learning and teaching setting. AD-gaming, BRIDGE, iCONNECT (Intergenerational CONtact between studeNts and people with dEmentia through CreaTive education), E.L.So.M.C.I (English Lessons with the Use of Songs for People with Mild Cognitive Impairment), Games4CoSkills, and De-Sign are all Erasmus+ projects that aim to improve the quality of life of patients with MCI or dementia.

Methods to Discover and Validate Biofluid-Based Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Dementias.,"Neurodegenerative dementias are progressive diseases that cause neuronal network breakdown in different brain regions often because of accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain extracellular matrix, such as amyloids or inside neurons or other cell types of the brain. Several diagnostic protein biomarkers in body fluids are being used and implemented, such as for Alzheimer's disease. However, there is still a lack of biomarkers for co-pathologies and other causes of dementia. Such biofluid-based biomarkers enable precision medicine approaches for diagnosis and treatment, allow to learn more about underlying disease processes, and facilitate the development of patient inclusion and evaluation tools in clinical trials. When designing studies to discover novel biofluid-based biomarkers, choice of technology is an important starting point. But there are so many technologies to choose among. To address this, we here review the technologies that are currently available in research settings and, in some cases, in clinical laboratory practice.

Oculometric measures as a tool for assessment of clinical symptoms and severity of Parkinson's disease.,"Abnormalities of oculometric measures (OM) are widely described in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, knowledge of correlations between abnormal OM, disease severity and clinical assessment in PD patients is still lacking. To evaluate these correlations, PD patients (215 patients, mean age 69 ± 9.1 years, 79 females) with severe (H&Y > 3) and mild to moderate (H&Y ≤ 2) disease, and 215 age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled. All patients were evaluated using MDS-UPDRS and an oculometric test using computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Comparisons of OM between groups and correlations between OM and MDS-UPDRS scores were calculated. Saccadic latency (ms) was prolonged in patients with severe compared with mild to moderate disease (pro-saccades: 267 ± 69 vs. 238 ± 53, p = 0.0011; anti-saccades: 386 ± 119 vs. 352 ± 106, p = 0.0393) and in patients with mild to moderate disease versus healthy subjects (pro-saccades: 238 ± 53 vs. 220 ± 45, p = 0.0003; anti-saccades: 352 ± 106 vs. 289 ± 71, p < 0.0001). Error rate (%) was higher among patients with severe (64.06 ± 23.08) versus mild to moderate disease (49.84 ± 24.81, p = 0.0001), and versus healthy subjects (49.84 ± 24.81 vs. 28.31 ± 21.72, p = 0.00001). Response accuracy (%) was lower for patients with severe (75.66 ± 13.11) versus mild to moderate disease (79.66 ± 13.56, p = 0.0462), and versus healthy subjects (79.66 ± 13.56 vs. 90.27 ± 8.79, p < 0.0001). Pro- and anti-saccadic latency, error rate and accuracy were correlated with MDS-UPDRS scores (r = 0.32, 0.28, 0.36 and -0.30, respectively, p < 0.0001) and similar correlations were found with its axial subscore (R = 0.38, 0.29, 0.44, and -0.30, respectively, p < 0.0001).

STRIDE: Systematic Radar Intelligence Analysis for ADRD Risk Evaluation with Gait Signature Simulation and Deep Learning.,"Abnormal gait is a significant non-cognitive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). Micro-Doppler radar, a non-wearable technology, can capture human gait movements for potential early ADRD risk assessment. In this research, we propose to design STRIDE integrating micro-Doppler radar sensors with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. STRIDE embeds a new deep learning (DL) classification framework. As a proof of concept, we develop a ""digital-twin"" of STRIDE, consisting of a human walking simulation model and a micro-Doppler radar simulation model, to generate a gait signature dataset. Taking established human walking parameters, the walking model simulates individuals with ADRD under various conditions. The radar model based on electromagnetic scattering and the Doppler frequency shift model is employed to generate micro-Doppler signatures from different moving body parts (e.g., foot, limb, joint, torso, shoulder, etc.). A band-dependent DL framework is developed to predict ADRD risks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of STRIDE for evaluating ADRD risk.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia; Deep learning; gait analysis; micro-Doppler radar,,"Cai, F; Patharkar, A; Wu, T; Lure, FYM; Chen, H; Chen, VC"
Capturing Measures That Matter: The Potential Value of Digital Measures of Physical Behavior for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of dementia worldwide. Despite the magnitude of AD's impact on patients, caregivers, and society, nearly all AD clinical trials fail. A potential contributor to this high rate of failure is that established clinical outcome assessments fail to capture subtle clinical changes, entail high burden for patients and their caregivers, and ineffectively address the aspects of health deemed important by patients and their caregivers. AD progression is associated with widespread changes in physical behavior that have impacts on the ability to function independently, which is a meaningful aspect of health for patients with AD and important for diagnosis. However, established assessments of functional independence remain underutilized in AD clinical trials and are limited by subjective biases and ceiling effects. Digital measures of real-world physical behavior assessed passively, continuously, and remotely using digital health technologies have the potential to address some of these limitations and to capture aspects of functional independence in patients with AD. In particular, measures of real-world gait, physical activity, and life-space mobility captured with wearable sensors may offer value. Additional research is needed to understand the validity, feasibility, and acceptability of these measures in AD clinical research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; digital measure; drug development; gait; life-space mobility; meaningful aspect of health; physical behavior; physical function; wearable sensor,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Caregivers; Drug Development,"Bachman, SL; Blankenship, JM; Busa, M; Serviente, C; Lyden, K; Clay, I"

PFP-HOG: Pyramid and Fixed-Size Patch-Based HOG Technique for Automated Brain Abnormality Classification with MRI.,"Detecting neurological abnormalities such as brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images is an important research topic in the literature. Numerous machine learning models have been used to detect brain abnormalities accurately. This study addresses the problem of detecting neurological abnormalities in MRI. The motivation behind this problem lies in the need for accurate and efficient methods to assist neurologists in the diagnosis of these disorders. In addition, many deep learning techniques have been applied to MRI to develop accurate brain abnormality detection models, but these networks have high time complexity. Hence, a novel hand-modeled feature-based learning network is presented to reduce the time complexity and obtain high classification performance. The model proposed in this work uses a new feature generation architecture named pyramid and fixed-size patch (PFP). The main aim of the proposed PFP structure is to attain high classification performance using essential feature extractors with both multilevel and local features. Furthermore, the PFP feature extractor generates low- and high-level features using a handcrafted extractor. To obtain the high discriminative feature extraction ability of the PFP, we have used histogram-oriented gradients (HOG); hence, it is named PFP-HOG. Furthermore, the iterative Chi2 (IChi2) is utilized to choose the clinically significant features. Finally, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) with tenfold cross-validation is used for automated classification. Four MRI neurological databases (AD dataset, brain tumor dataset 1, brain tumor dataset 2, and merged dataset) have been utilized to develop our model. PFP-HOG and IChi2-based models attained 100%, 94.98%, 98.19%, and 97.80% using the AD dataset, brain tumor dataset1, brain tumor dataset 2, and merged brain MRI dataset, respectively. These findings not only provide an accurate and robust classification of various neurological disorders using MRI but also hold the potential to assist neurologists in validating manual MRI brain abnormality screening.",2023,Biomedical image processing; Brain MRI; Computer vision; HOG; Pyramid and fixed-size patch feature extraction,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Alzheimer Disease,"Kaplan, E; Chan, WY; Altinsoy, HB; Baygin, M; Barua, PD; Chakraborty, S; Dogan, S; Tuncer, T; Acharya, UR"

Presymptomatic and early pathological features of MAPT-associated frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"Early pathological features of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) due to MAPT pathogenic variants (FTLD-MAPT) are understudied, since early-stage tissue is rarely available. Here, we report unique pathological data from three presymptomatic/early-stage MAPT variant carriers (FTLD Clinical Dementia Rating [FTLD-CDR] = 0-1). We examined neuronal degeneration semi-quantitatively and digitally quantified tau burden in 18 grey matter (9 cortical, 9 subcortical) and 13 white matter (9 cortical, 4 subcortical) regions. We compared presymptomatic/early-stage pathology to an intermediate/end-stage cohort (FTLD-CDR = 2-3) with the same variants (2 L315R, 10 P301L, 6 G272V), and developed a clinicopathological staging model for P301L and G272V variants. The 68-year-old presymptomatic L315R carrier (FTLD-CDR = 0) had limited tau burden morphologically similar to L315R end-stage carriers in middle frontal, antero-inferior temporal, amygdala, (para-)hippocampus and striatum, along with age-related Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change. The 59-year-old prodromal P301L carrier (FTLD-CDR = 0.5) had highest tau burden in anterior cingulate, anterior temporal, middle/superior frontal, and fronto-insular cortex, and amygdala. The 45-year-old early-stage G272V carrier (FTLD-CDR = 1) had highest tau burden in superior frontal and anterior cingulate cortex, subiculum and CA1. The severity and distribution of tau burden showed some regional variability between variants at presymptomatic/early-stage, while neuronal degeneration, mild-to-moderate, was similarly distributed in frontotemporal regions. Early-stage tau burden and neuronal degeneration were both less severe than in intermediate-/end-stage cases. In a subset of regions (10 GM, 8 WM) used for clinicopathological staging, clinical severity correlated strongly with neuronal degeneration (rho = 0.72, p < 0.001), less strongly with GM tau burden (rho = 0.57, p = 0.006), and did not with WM tau burden (p = 0.9). Clinicopathological staging showed variant-specific patterns of early tau pathology and progression across stages. These unique data demonstrate that tau pathology and neuronal degeneration are present already at the presymptomatic/early-stage of FTLD-MAPT, though less severely compared to intermediate/end-stage disease. Moreover, early pathological patterns, especially of tau burden, differ partly between specific MAPT variants.",2023,Early pathology; Frontotemporal lobar degeneration; MAPT gene; Neuronal degeneration; Tau burden,Humans; Aged; Middle Aged; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Frontotemporal Dementia; tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Gray Matter; Gyrus Cinguli,"Giannini, LA; Mol, MO; Rajicic, A; van Buuren, R; Sarkar, L; Arezoumandan, S; Ohm, DT; Irwin, DJ; Rozemuller, AJ; van Swieten, JC; Seelaar, H"

Cognition and Functionality Were Not Affected Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic in People with Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD Dementia Attending Digital Non-Pharmacologic Interventions.,"The majority of previous studies showed that older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) had impaired cognition and mood status, as well as increased behavioral disturbances after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are still controversial data as regards the multifactorial impact of the restrictive measures on cognition, mood and daily function in older adults with MCI and ADD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease dementia; COVID-19 pandemic effect; COVID-19 quarantine; mild cognitive impairment,,"Tsatali, M; Moraitou, D; Boza, ES; Tsolaki, M"
Spatial cognition is associated with levels of phosphorylated-tau and β-amyloid in clinically normal older adults.,Spatial cognition is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the symptomatic stages of the disease. We investigated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (phosphorylated-tau [p-tau] and β-amyloid) are associated with poorer spatial cognition in clinically normal older adults. Participants were 1875 clinically normal adults (age 67.8 [8.5] years) from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia Consortium.

Speech and language markers of neurodegeneration: a call for global equity.,"In the field of neurodegeneration, speech and language assessments are useful for diagnosing aphasic syndromes and for characterizing other disorders. As a complement to classic tests, scalable and low-cost digital tools can capture relevant anomalies automatically, potentially supporting the quest for globally equitable markers of brain health. However, this promise remains unfulfilled due to limited linguistic diversity in scientific works and clinical instruments. Here we argue for cross-linguistic research as a core strategy to counter this problem. First, we survey the contributions of linguistic assessments in the study of primary progressive aphasia and the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Second, we address two forms of linguistic unfairness in the literature: the neglect of most of the world's 7000 languages and the preponderance of English-speaking cohorts. Third, we review studies showing that linguistic dysfunctions in a given disorder may vary depending on the patient's language and that English speakers offer a suboptimal benchmark for other language groups. Finally, we highlight different approaches, tools and initiatives for cross-linguistic research, identifying core challenges for their deployment. Overall, we seek to inspire timely actions to counter a looming source of inequity in behavioural neurology.",2023,cross-linguistic research; language diversity; linguistic testing; neurodegenerative diseases,Humans; Speech; Language; Aphasia; Linguistics; Alzheimer Disease,"García, AM; de Leon, J; Tee, BL; Blasi, DE; Gorno-Tempini, ML"

Whether similar mechanisms explain tau progression from the locus coeruleus (LC), a tiny noradrenergic brainstem nucleus involved in novelty, learning, and memory and among the earliest regions to accumulate tau, has not yet been established.

The roles of natural triterpenoid saponins against Alzheimer's disease.,"The aging of the world population and increasing stress levels in life are the major cause of the increased incidence of neurological disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) creates a huge burden on the lives and health of individuals and has become a big concern for society. Triterpenoid saponins (TS), representative natural product components, have a wide range of pharmacological bioactivities such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation, antiapoptosis, hormone-like, and gut microbiota regulation. Notably, some natural TS exhibited promising neuroprotective activity that can intervene in AD progress, especially in the early stage. Recently, studies have indicated that TS play a pronounced positive role in the prevention and treatment of AD. This review discusses the recent research on the neuroprotection of TS and proceeds to detail the action mechanisms of TS against AD, hoping to provide a reference for drug development for anti-AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; action mechanism; neuroprotection; triterpenoid saponins,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Antioxidants; Neuroprotection; Saponins; Triterpenes,"Zhou, JC; Li, HL; Zhou, Y; Li, XT; Yang, ZY; Tohda, C; Komatsu, K; Piao, XH; Ge, YW"
Using Biomarkers for Cognitive Enhancement and Evaluation in Mobile Applications.,"Clinicians are increasingly using biomarkers to diagnose and monitor cognitive conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Biomarkers are classified into two main categories based on their clinical goal: disease-associated biomarkers and drug-related biomarkers. In the case of disease-associated biomarkers, neuroimaging biomarkers are used to predict and validate Alzheimer's disease at any of its stages including mild cognitive impairment. The use of mobile and wearable devices to collect data about a person's daily activities and behaviors has led to the emergence of a new type of biomarker known as digital biomarkers. This type of data provides a digital reflection of a person's function in the context of everyday life and can be used to monitor and track changes in an individual's health and behaviors over time. The use of biomarkers in mobile applications for cognitive enhancement and evaluation can provide valuable insights into an individual's cognitive health and can help to optimize treatment and prevention strategies.",2023,Biomarkers; Cognitive enhancement; Digital biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Mobile Applications; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Disease Progression; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Giannopoulou, P; Vlamos, P"
Making Pre-screening for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Postoperative Delirium Among Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) a National Priority: The Deep Neuro Study.,"SARS-CoV-2 effects on cognition are a vibrant area of active research. Many researchers suggest that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms leading to hospitalization sustain significant neurodegenerative injury, such as encephalopathy and poor discharge disposition. However, despite some post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) case series that have described elevated neurodegenerative biomarkers, no studies have been identified that directly compared levels to those in mild cognitive impairment, non-PACS postoperative delirium patients after major non-emergent surgery, or preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients that have clinical evidence of Alzheimer's without symptoms. According to recent estimates, there may be 416 million people globally on the AD continuum, which include approximately 315 million people with preclinical AD. In light of all the above, a more effective application of digital biomarker and explainable artificial intelligence methodologies that explored amyloid beta, neuronal, axonal, and glial markers in relation to neurological complications in-hospital or later outcomes could significantly assist progress in the field. Easy and scalable subjects' risk stratification is of utmost importance, yet current international collaboration initiatives are still challenging due to the limited explainability and accuracy to identify individuals at risk or in the earliest stages that might be candidates for future clinical trials. In this open letter, we propose the administration of selected digital biomarkers previously discovered and validated in other EU-funded studies to become a routine assessment for non-PACS preoperative cognitive impairment, PACS neurological complications in-hospital, or later PACS and non-PACS improvement in cognition after surgery. The open letter also includes an economic analysis of the implications for such national-level initiatives. Similar collaboration initiatives could have existing pre-diagnostic detection and progression prediction solutions pre-screen the stage before and around diagnosis, enabling new disease manifestation mapping and pushing the field into unchartered territory.",2023,Artificial intelligence; Digital biomarkers; Genetics; National priority projects,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Artificial Intelligence; Emergence Delirium; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Tarnanas, I; Tsolaki, M"

We first provide a brief review of literature within the past 10 years on ANS and dementia-related brain pathologies. Next, we present an ANS flexibility model, describing how the model can be applied to understand these brain pathologies, as well as differentiate or even be leveraged to modify typical brain aging and dementia. Lastly, we briefly discuss the implication of the model for understanding resilience and vulnerability to dementia-related outcomes.",2023,Adaptation; Autonomic nervous system flexibility; Brain aging; Dementia pathologies; Interoception,Humans; Brain; Autonomic Nervous System; Alzheimer Disease; Aging,"Lin, FV; Heffner, KL"

Reduced slow-wave activity and autonomic dysfunction during sleep precede cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.,"Occurrence of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation in brain begins before the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as preclinical AD. Studies have reported that sleep problems and autonomic dysfunction associate closely with AD. However, whether they, especially the interaction between sleep and autonomic function, play critical roles in preclinical AD are unclear. Therefore, we investigated how sleep patterns and autonomic regulation at different sleep-wake stages changed and whether they were related to cognitive performance in pathogenesis of AD mice. Polysomnographic recordings in freely-moving APP/PS1 and wild-type (WT) littermates were collected to study sleep patterns and autonomic function at 4 (early disease stage) and 8 months of age (advanced disease stage), cognitive tasks including novel object recognition and Morris water maze were performed, and Aβ levels in brain were measured. APP/PS1 mice at early stage of AD pathology with Aβ aggregation but without significant differences in cognitive performance had frequent sleep-wake transitions, lower sleep-related delta power percentage, lower overall autonomic activity, and lower parasympathetic activity mainly during sleep compared with WT mice. The same phenomenon was observed in advanced-stage APP/PS1 mice with significant cognitive deficits. In mice at both disease stages, sleep-related delta power percentage correlated positively with memory performance. At early stage, memory performance correlated positively with sympathetic activity during wakefulness; at advanced stage, memory performance correlated positively with parasympathetic activity during both wakefulness and sleep. In conclusion, sleep quality and distinction between wake- and sleep-related autonomic function may be biomarkers for early AD detection.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Mice, Transgenic; Alzheimer Disease; Primary Dysautonomias; Sleep; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Chen, CW; Kwok, YT; Cheng, YT; Huang, YS; Kuo, TBJ; Wu, CH; Du, PJ; Yang, AC; Yang, CCH"

Wearable movement-tracking data identify Parkinson's disease years before clinical diagnosis.,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder with a long latent phase and currently no disease-modifying treatments. Reliable predictive biomarkers that could transform efforts to develop neuroprotective treatments remain to be identified. Using UK Biobank, we investigated the predictive value of accelerometry in identifying prodromal Parkinson's disease in the general population and compared this digital biomarker with models based on genetics, lifestyle, blood biochemistry or prodromal symptoms data.

Resting-state EEG signatures of Alzheimer's disease are driven by periodic but not aperiodic changes.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasise the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",2023,,,"Kopčanová, M; Tait, L; Donoghue, T; Stothart, G; Smith, L; Sandoval, AAF; Davila-Perez, P; Buss, S; Shafi, MM; Pascual-Leone, A; Fried, PJ; Benwell, CSY"

We aimed to develop non-invasive and cost-effective classification models for predicting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using eye movement (EM) data.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; eye movement analysis and synthesis; machine learning (ML); mild cognitive impairment; saccades,,"Opwonya, J; Ku, B; Lee, KH; Kim, JI; Kim, JU"
New-onset neurodegenerative diseases as long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The association between SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased risk for new-onset neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to elucidate whether new-onset neurodegenerative diseases are long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. PubMed/MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE were systematically searched for articles published up to January 10, 2023. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to calculate the pooled effect size, expressed as hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of each outcome. Twelve studies involving 33 146 809 individuals (2 688 417 post-COVID-19 cases and 30 458 392 controls) were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled analyses compared with control groups showed a significant association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased risk for new-onset Alzheimer's disease (HR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.22-1.85, I",2023,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; meta-analysis; neurodegenerative disorders,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression,"Rahmati, M; Yon, DK; Lee, SW; Soysal, P; Koyanagi, A; Jacob, L; Li, Y; Park, JM; Kim, YW; Shin, JI; Smith, L"

Comparing Emotional Valence Scores of Twitter Messages from Human Coding and Machine Learning Algorithms Among Hispanic and African American Family Caregivers of Persons with Dementia.,"We compared emotional valence scores as determined via machine learning approaches to human-coded scores of direct messages on Twitter from our 2,301 followers during a Twitter-based clinical trial screening for Hispanic and African American family caregivers of persons with dementia. We manually assigned emotional valence scores to 249 randomly selected direct Twitter messages from our followers (N=2,301), then we applied three machine learning sentiment analysis algorithms to extract emotional valence scores for each message and compared their mean scores to the human coding results. The aggregated mean emotional scores from the natural language processing were slightly positive, while the mean score from human coding as a gold standard was negative. Clusters of strongly negative sentiments were observed in followers' responses to being found non-eligible for the study, indicating a significant need for alternative strategies to provide similar research opportunities to non-eligible family caregivers.",2023,dementia caregiving; health disparity; machine learning,Humans; Algorithms; Black or African American; Caregivers; Dementia; Hispanic or Latino; Machine Learning; Social Media; Emotions,"Yoon, S; Broadwell, P; Tipiani, D; Bristol, A; Moon, S; Yoon, B; Liu, J; Huang, N; Davis, N"
Analyzing Twitter-Based Social Networks of Support Communities for Hispanic and African American Family Caregivers of Persons with Dementia.,"We applied social network analysis to compare Hispanic and Black dementia caregiving networks on Twitter that were established as part of a clinical trial from January 12, 2022, to October 31, 2022. We extracted Twitter data from our caregiver support communities (N=1980 followers, 811 enrollees) via the Twitter API and used social network analysis software to compare friend/follower interactions within each Hispanic and Black caregiving network. Analysis of the social networks revealed that enrolled family caregivers without prior social media competency had overall low connectedness compared to both enrolled and non-enrolled caregivers with social media competency, who were more integrated into the communities that developed through the clinical trial, partly due to their ties to external dementia caregiving groups. These observed dynamics will help to guide further social media-based interventions and also support the observation that our recruitment strategies effectively enrolled family caregivers with various levels of social media competency.",2023,African American; Hispanic; Twitter; dementia caregiver; social network,Humans; Black or African American; Caregivers; Dementia; Hispanic or Latino; Social Media; Social Networking; Online Social Networking; Social Support,"Broadwell, P; Huang, N; Moon, S; Tipiani, D; De Planell-Saguer, M; Bristol, A; Liu, J; Davis, N; Yoon, S"

Activation of Gq-Coupled Receptors in Astrocytes Restores Cognitive Function in Alzheimer's Disease Mice Model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases. Most of the current AD therapeutic developments are directed towards improving neuronal cell function or facilitating Aβ amyloid clearance from the brain. However, some recent evidence suggests that astrocytes may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of the optogenetic activation of Gq-coupled exogenous receptors expressed in astrocytes as a possible way of restoring brain function in the AD mouse model. We evaluated the effects of the optogenetic activation of astrocytes on long-term potentiation, spinal morphology and behavioral readouts in 5xFAD mouse model of AD. We determined that in vivo chronic activation of astrocytes resulted in the preservation of spine density, increased mushroom spine survival, and improved performance in cognitive behavioral tests. Furthermore, chronic optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes resulted in the elevation of EAAT-2 glutamate uptake transporter expression, which could be a possible explanation for the observed in vivo neuroprotective effects. The obtained results suggest that the persistent activation of astrocytes may be considered a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; EAAT-2; Gq-coupled proteins; astrocytes; behavioral tests; long-term potentiation; opto-α1-adrenoreceptor; optogenetics,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Astrocytes; Cognition; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Transgenic","Gerasimov, E; Bezprozvanny, I; Vlasova, OL"

Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Speech and language changes occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few studies have characterized their longitudinal course. We analyzed open-ended speech samples from a prodromal-to-mild AD cohort to develop a novel composite score to characterize progressive speech changes. Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD. Speech-based composite scores could be used to monitor change and detect response to treatment in future research.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; digital biomarkers; language; mild cognitive impairment; natural language processing; speech,,"Robin, J; Xu, M; Balagopalan, A; Novikova, J; Kahn, L; Oday, A; Hejrati, M; Hashemifar, S; Negahdar, M; Simpson, W; Teng, E"

Integrative metabolomics science in Alzheimer's disease: Relevance and future perspectives.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is determined by various pathophysiological mechanisms starting 10-25 years before the onset of clinical symptoms. As multiple functionally interconnected molecular/cellular pathways appear disrupted in AD, the exploitation of high-throughput unbiased omics sciences is critical to elucidating the precise pathogenesis of AD. Among different omics, metabolomics is a fast-growing discipline allowing for the simultaneous detection and quantification of hundreds/thousands of perturbed metabolites in tissues or biofluids, reproducing the fluctuations of multiple networks affected by a disease. Here, we seek to critically depict the main metabolomics methodologies with the aim of identifying new potential AD biomarkers and further elucidating AD pathophysiological mechanisms. From a systems biology perspective, as metabolic alterations can occur before the development of clinical signs, metabolomics - coupled with existing accessible biomarkers used for AD screening and diagnosis - can support early disease diagnosis and help develop individualized treatment plans. Presently, the majority of metabolomic analyses emphasized that lipid metabolism is the most consistently altered pathway in AD pathogenesis. The possibility that metabolomics may reveal crucial steps in AD pathogenesis is undermined by the difficulty in discriminating between the causal or epiphenomenal or compensatory nature of metabolic findings.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amino acids; Biomarkers; Lipids; Metabolomics; Systems biology,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Metabolomics; Metabolome; Biomarkers,"Lista, S; González-Domínguez, R; López-Ortiz, S; González-Domínguez, Á; Menéndez, H; Martín-Hernández, J; Lucia, A; Emanuele, E; Centonze, D; Imbimbo, BP; Triaca, V; Lionetto, L; Simmaco, M; Cuperlovic-Culf, M; Mill, J; Li, L; Mapstone, M; Santos-Lozano, A; Nisticò, R"

Partially Observed Dynamic Tensor Response Regression.,"In modern data science, dynamic tensor data prevail in numerous applications. An important task is to characterize the relationship between dynamic tensor datasets and external covariates. However, the tensor data are often only partially observed, rendering many existing methods inapplicable. In this article, we develop a regression model with a partially observed dynamic tensor as the response and external covariates as the predictor. We introduce the low-rankness, sparsity, and fusion structures on the regression coefficient tensor, and consider a loss function projected over the observed entries. We develop an efficient nonconvex alternating updating algorithm, and derive the finite-sample error bound of the actual estimator from each step of our optimization algorithm. Unobserved entries in the tensor response have imposed serious challenges. As a result, our proposal differs considerably in terms of estimation algorithm, regularity conditions, as well as theoretical properties, compared to the existing tensor completion or tensor response regression solutions. We illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method using simulations and two real applications, including a neuroimaging dementia study and a digital advertising study.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Digital advertising; Neuroimaging analysis; Nonconvex optimization; Tensor completion; Tensor regression,,"Zhou, J; Sun, WW; Zhang, J; Li, L"
It is the locus coeruleus! Or… is it?: a proposition for analyses and reporting standards for structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus.,"The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is one of the protein pathology epicenters in neurodegenerative diseases. In contrast to PET (positron emission tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) offers the spatial resolution necessary to investigate the 3-4 mm wide and 1.5 cm long LC. However, standard data postprocessing is often too spatially imprecise to allow investigating the structure and function of the LC at the group level. Our analysis pipeline uses a combination of existing toolboxes (SPM12, ANTs, FSL, FreeSurfer), and is tailored towards achieving suitable spatial precision in the brainstem area. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using 2 datasets comprising both younger and older adults. We also suggest quality assessment procedures which allow to quantify the spatial precision obtained. Spatial deviations below 2.5 mm in the LC area are achieved, which is superior to current standard approaches. Relevant for ageing and clinical researchers interested in brainstem imaging, we provide a tool for more reliable analyses of structural and functional LC imaging data which can be also adapted for investigating other nuclei of the brainstem.",2023,Coregistration; Locus coeruleus; MRI; Neuromelanin-sensitive imaging; Normalization; fMRI,Humans; Aged; Locus Coeruleus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Aging; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Positron-Emission Tomography; Norepinephrine,"Yi, YJ; Lüsebrink, F; Ludwig, M; Maaß, A; Ziegler, G; Yakupov, R; Kreißl, MC; Betts, M; Speck, O; Düzel, E; Hämmerer, D"

"Life Course Cardiovascular Health: Risk Factors, Outcomes, and Interventions.","Since it was first defined by the American Heart Association in 2010, cardiovascular health (CVH) has been extensively studied across the life course. In this review, we present the current literature examining early life predictors of CVH, the later life outcomes of child CVH, and the relatively few interventions which have specifically addressed how to preserve and promote CVH across populations. We find that research on CVH has demonstrated that prenatal and childhood exposures are consistently associated with CVH trajectories from childhood through adulthood. CVH measured at any point in life is strongly predictive of future cardiovascular disease, dementia, cancer, and mortality as well as a variety of other health outcomes. This speaks to the importance of intervening early to prevent the loss of optimal CVH and the accumulation of cardiovascular risk. Interventions to improve CVH are not common but those that have been published most often address multiple modifiable risk factors among individuals within the community. Relatively few interventions have been focused on improving the construct of CVH in children. Future research is needed that will be both effective, scalable, and sustainable. Technology including digital platforms as well as implementation science will play key roles in achieving this vision. In addition, community engagement at all stages of this research is critical. Lastly, prevention strategies that are tailored to the individual and their context may help us achieve the promise of personalized prevention and help promote ideal CVH in childhood and across the life course.",2023,American Heart Association; cardiovascular diseases; heart diseases; risk factors,Child; Humans; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular System; Life Change Events; Risk Factors; United States,"Pedamallu, H; Zmora, R; Perak, AM; Allen, NB"

Normative data for COGITAB: An Italian tablet-based test battery conceived for the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease.,"The number of people with dementia is increasing worldwide.

Network connectivity and structural correlates of survival in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome.,"There is a pressing need to understand the factors that predict prognosis in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS), with high heterogeneity over the poor average survival. We test the hypothesis that the magnitude and distribution of connectivity changes in PSP and CBS predict the rate of progression and survival time, using datasets from the Cambridge Centre for Parkinson-plus and the UK National PSP Research Network (PROSPECT-MR). Resting-state functional MRI images were available from 146 participants with PSP, 82 participants with CBS, and 90 healthy controls. Large-scale networks were identified through independent component analyses, with correlations taken between component time series. Independent component analysis was also used to select between-network connectivity components to compare with baseline clinical severity, longitudinal rate of change in severity, and survival. Transdiagnostic survival predictors were identified using partial least squares regression for Cox models, with connectivity compared to patients' demographics, structural imaging, and clinical scores using five-fold cross-validation. In PSP and CBS, between-network connectivity components were identified that differed from controls, were associated with disease severity, and were related to survival and rate of change in clinical severity. A transdiagnostic component predicted survival beyond demographic and motion metrics but with lower accuracy than an optimal model that included the clinical and structural imaging measures. Cortical atrophy enhanced the connectivity changes that were most predictive of survival. Between-network connectivity is associated with variability in prognosis in PSP and CBS but does not improve predictive accuracy beyond clinical and structural imaging metrics.",2023,connectivity; corticobasal syndrome; fMRI; prediction; progressive supranuclear palsy; survival; tauopathies,"Humans; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; Corticobasal Degeneration; Prognosis; Neurodegenerative Diseases","Whiteside, DJ; Street, D; Murley, AG; Jones, PS; Malpetti, M; Ghosh, BCP; Coyle-Gilchrist, I; Gerhard, A; Hu, MT; Klein, JC; Leigh, PN; Church, A; Burn, DJ; Morris, HR; Rowe, JB; Rittman, T"

Interprofessional Needs Analysis and User-Centred Prototype Evaluation as a Foundation for Building Individualized Digital Education in Dementia Healthcare Supported by Artificial Intelligence: A Study Protocol.,"Continuous profession-specific training is necessary to provide high-quality care for people with dementia. Research shows the need for more educational programmes that are personalized and responsive to the learning needs and preferences of staff. Digital solutions supported by artificial intelligence (AI) may be a means of making these improvements. There is a lack of formats that support learners in selecting the right content according to their learning needs and preferences. The project ""My INdividual Digital EDucation.RUHR"" (MINDED.RUHR) addresses this problem and seeks to develop an automatized delivery system for individual learning content using AI. The sub-project presented here aims to achieve the following: (a) explore learning needs and preferences regarding behavioural changes in people with dementia, (b) develop learning nuggets, (c) evaluate the feasibility of the digital learning platform, and (d) identify optimization criteria. Following the first phase of the framework for the design and evaluation of digital health interventions (DEDHI), we use a qualitative approach with focus group interviews for exploration and development, and co-design workshops and expert audits to evaluate the developed learning nuggets. The developed e-learning tool is the first step in supporting the digital training of healthcare professionals in the context of caring for people with dementia, individualized through AI.",2023,artificial intelligence; behavioural change; dementia; digital education; individual education; learning preferences,,"Malek, M; Nitsche, J; Dinand, C; Ehlers, J; Lissek, V; Böhm, P; Derksen, EM; Halek, M"
"Active and Assisted Living, a Practice for the Ageing Population and People with Cognitive Disabilities: An Architectural Perspective.","The current digital revolution is causing a paradigm shift encompassing all environments in which human beings conduct their daily activities. Technology is starting to govern the world, gradually modifying not only individual and social behaviour, but also ways of living. The necessary adaptation to new information and communication technologies forces societies to rethink both public and private spaces, in which evolution is slower than rapid social transformation. As part of this change, the concept of Active Assisted Living (AAL) has developed. Assisted spaces can be designed to provide older adults, carers, or people who have cognitive disabilities, such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, with a healthier, safer, and more comfortable life, while also affording them greater personal autonomy. AAL aims to improve people's quality of life and allow them to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, not in residences. This study conducted a critical review about AAL from an architectural point of view. The research adopted a qualitative approach in which we collected the studies during the last twenty years, then used descriptive, narrative and critical analysis methods. Based on these, this paper aims to explain this new technological paradigm, its characteristics, its main development trends, and its implementation limitations. The results obtained show how the development of AAL will be in the next ten years, and how this concept, and its application, can influence architecture and provide the bases for further research into the design of buildings and cities.",2023,Active Assisted Living; Ambient Assisted Living; ageing; ambient adapted to Alzheimer’s outpatients; ambient intelligence; cognitive architectural design; health humanities; healthy architecture,Humans; Aged; Quality of Life; Alzheimer Disease; Health Status; Aging; Cognition,"Quesada-García, S; Valero-Flores, P; Lozano-Gómez, M"

Effectiveness of digital technologies to engage and support the wellbeing of people with dementia and family carers at home and in care homes: A scoping review.,"Use of digital technologies to support meaningful engagement of people with dementia and carers increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this scoping review was to determine the effectiveness of digital technologies in supporting the engagement and wellbeing of people with dementia and family carers at home and in care homes. Studies published in peer reviewed literature were identified across four databases (CINAHL, Medline, PUBMED, PsychINFO). Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicate that digital technologies can potentially support the wellbeing of people with dementia and family carers, although only a few studies had measured impact on wellbeing, as many were reporting on technology at proof-of-concept stage rather than commercially ready products. Moreover, current studies lacked meaningful involvement of people with dementia, family carers, and care professionals in the design of the technology. Future research should bring together people with dementia, family carers, care professionals and designers to coproduce digital technologies with researchers and evaluate them using robust methodologies. Codesign should start early in the intervention development phase and continue until implementation. There is a need for real world applications that nurture social relationships by focusing on how digital technologies can support more personalised, adaptive forms of care. Developing the evidence base to identify what makes digital technologies effective in supporting the wellbeing of people with dementia is crucial. Future interventions should therefore consider the needs and preferences of people with dementia, their families, and professional carers, as well as the suitability and sensitivity of wellbeing outcome measures.",2023,care home; connection; coproduction; digital technologies; engagement; home; outcome measure; person centred; social relationships; wellbeing,Humans; Caregivers; Digital Technology; Pandemics; Dementia; COVID-19,"Bradley, L; Shanker, S; Murphy, J; Fenge, LA; Heward, M"
[The German S3 guidelines on dementia].,"Due to the demographic development, the number of dementia patients in Germany is continuously increasing. The complex care situation of those affected calls for meaningful guidelines. In 2008, the first S3 guideline on dementia was published, coordinated by the German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics (DGPPN) and the German Association for Neurology (DGN) and accompanied by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF). An update was published in 2016. In recent years, the diagnostic possibilities for Alzheimer's disease, in particular, have greatly developed and a new disease concept has emerged that includes mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as part of the clinical manifestation of the disease and also enables the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this phase. In the area of treatment, the first causal disease-modifying therapies will likely soon be available. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have also shown that up to 40% of the risks for dementia are dependent on modifiable risk factors, making prevention increasingly more important. In order to do justice to these developments a completely updated S3 guideline on dementia is currently being developed, which will be available digitally for the first time in the form of an app and which, in the sense of living guidelines, will enable rapid adjustments to progress in the future.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Living guidelines; Mild cognitive impairment; Prevention; Risk factors,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Psychotherapy; Psychiatry; Germany; Neurology,"Jessen, F; Bohr, L; Kruse, C; Dodel, R"

Model-Driven Dementia Prevention and Intervention Platform.,"Most types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, are not curable. However, there are risk factors, such as obesity or hypertension, that can promote the development of dementia. Holistic treatment of these risk factors can prevent the onset of dementia or delay it in its early stages. To support individualized treatment of risk factors in dementia, this paper presents a model-driven digital platform. It enables monitoring of biomarkers using smart devices from the internet of medical things (IoMT) for the target group. The collected data from such devices can be used to optimize and adjust treatment in a patient in the loop manner. To this end, providers such as Google Fit and Withings have been connected to the platform as example data sources. To achieve treatment and monitoring data interoperability with existing medical systems, internationally accepted standards such as FHIR are used. The configuration and control of the personalized treatment processes are achieved using a self-developed domain-specific language. For this language, an associated diagram editor was implemented, which allows the management of the treatment processes through graphical models. This graphical representation should help treatment providers to understand and manage these processes more easily. To investigate this hypothesis, a usability study was conducted with twelve participants. We were able to show that such graphical representations provide advantages in clarity in reviewing the system, but lack in easy set-up (compared to wizard-style systems).",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; FHIR; IoMT; digital prevention; internet of medical things; model-driven intervention planning; precision care; treatment platform,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Language; Data Collection; Palliative Care,"Schinle, M; Dietrich, M; Stock, S; Gerdes, M; Stork, W"

Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice and trials.,"Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials. Longitudinal measurements of such biomarkers will also improve the detection of relevant disease-modifying effects of new drugs or lifestyle interventions.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers","Hansson, O; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Dage, J"
Pearls & Oy-sters: Huntington Disease Presenting as Primary Progressive Aphasia: A Case of Semantics.,We present a case of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia as the presenting feature in a patient with Huntington disease (HD). The patient initially developed progressive language impairment including impaired naming and object knowledge and single-word comprehension and then developed chorea and behavioral changes. An MRI of the brain showed left anterior temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy. A neurologic FDG PET/CT showed reduced metabolism in the head of the left caudate nucleus. Huntingtin gene testing revealed an expansion of 39 CAG repeats in 1 allele. This case outlines the substantial overlap between the clinical presentation of HD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes and provides commentary on the investigation of these neurodegenerative diseases.,2023,,"Humans; Semantics; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Huntington Disease; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Brain; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Clarke, AJ; Manser, D; Fleischer, R; Fulham, M; Ahmed, RM"

Digital tools for delivery of dementia education for caregivers of persons with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of impact on caregiver distress and depressive symptoms.,"Continuing education for dementia has been shown to be beneficial by improving informal caregiver knowledge, dementia care, management, and caregiver physical and mental health. Technology-based dementia education has been noted to have equivalent effects as in-person education, but with the added benefit of asynchronous and/or remote delivery, which increases accessibility. Using Cochrane review methodology, this study systematically reviewed the literature on technology-based dementia education and its impacts on caregivers. Technology-based delivery included dementia education delivered via the Internet, telephone, telehealth, videophone, computer, or digital video device (DVD). In the review, twenty-eight studies were identified with fourteen included in a meta-analysis, and these data revealed a significant small effect of technologically based dementia education on reducing caregiver depression, and a medium effect on reducing caregiver distress in response to caregivers' observations of behavioral problems displayed by persons with dementia. No evidence was found for a significant effect of the educational intervention on caregiver burden or self-efficacy, which are known to be gendered aspects of caregiving. None of the studies included in the meta-analysis reported separate outcomes for male and female care providers, which has implications for gendered caregiving norms and aspects of care.

Déjà vécu with recollective confabulation: an unusual presentation of Alzheimer's disease.,"A man in his 80s presented with gradual onset of a persistent and delusion-like perception that novel encounters are repetitions of previous experiences. Within 2 years of symptom onset, he had impaired verbal memory and executive dysfunction on neuropsychological assessment. Cerebrospinal fluid core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers analysis supported probable AD. Generalised and left temporal atrophy was seen on MRI of the brain. Neurological fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed left temporal and bilateral frontal lobe hypometabolism. His presenting symptom is known as déjà vécu with recollective confabulation, a rare phenomenon associated with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. While several potential mechanisms have been previously proposed, the fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT hypometabolism in the temporal and frontal lobes in this case suggests dual deficits in recognition memory and metacognition may be culprit mechanisms.

Promoting Physical Activity in a Primary Care Practice in People Living with Dementia and Their Family Caregivers.,"People living with dementia (PLWD) and their family caregivers report higher rates of having a sedentary lifestyle than their non-disabled peers do. This study analyzed the effectiveness of an intervention designed to increase physical activity among PLWD and their family caregivers in primary health care settings. A cluster-randomized multicenter clinical trial was conducted. Participants from four health centers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG) in a 1:1 ratio using Epidat software. After a seven-day period with a digital pedometer (Omron Hj-321 lay-UPS), participants were asked to complete the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF). PLWD and caregivers allocated to the IG were given brief advice, educational materials and an additional 15 min appointment to prescribe an individualized physical activity plan. Seventy PLWD and 80 caregivers were assigned to the CG and 70 PLWD and 96 caregivers were assigned to the IG. Results of the pedometer assessment show that in PLWD, the IG's activity increased by 52.89 aerobic steps at 6 months and the CG's activity decreased by 615.93 aerobic steps, showing a net increase in the IG of 668.82 (95% CI: -444.27 to 1781.91; ",2023,caregivers; dementia; physical activity; primary care; randomized controlled trials,,"de Dios-Rodríguez, E; Patino-Alonso, C; González-Sánchez, S; Tamayo-Morales, O; Ripoll, J; Mora-Simón, S; Unzueta-Arce, J; Gómez-Marcos, MA; García-Ortiz, L; Rodríguez-Sánchez, E"

Data-driven neuropathological staging and subtyping of TDP-43 proteinopathies.,"TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) accumulation is the primary pathology underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Charting the progression and heterogeneity of TDP-43 accumulation is necessary to better characterize TDP-43 proteinopathies, but current TDP-43 staging systems are heuristic and assume each syndrome is homogeneous. Here, we use data-driven disease progression modelling to derive a fine-grained empirical staging system for the classification and differentiation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP, n = 126), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 141) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) with and without Alzheimer's disease (n = 304). The data-driven staging of ALS and FTLD-TDP complement and extend previously described human-defined staging schema for ALS and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In LATE-NC individuals, progression along data-driven stages was positively associated with age, but negatively associated with age in individuals with FTLD-TDP. Using only regional TDP-43 severity, our data driven model distinguished individuals diagnosed with ALS, FTLD-TDP or LATE-NC with a cross-validated accuracy of 85.9%, with misclassifications associated with mixed pathological diagnosis, age and genetic mutations. Adding age and SuStaIn stage to this model increased accuracy to 92.3%. Our model differentiates LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP, though some overlap was observed between late-stage LATE-NC and early-stage FTLD-TDP. We further tested for the presence of subtypes with distinct regional TDP-43 progression patterns within each diagnostic group, identifying two distinct cortical-predominant and brainstem-predominant subtypes within FTLD-TDP and a further two subcortical-predominant and corticolimbic-predominant subtypes within ALS. The FTLD-TDP subtypes exhibited differing proportions of TDP-43 type, while there was a trend for age differing between ALS subtypes. Interestingly, a negative relationship between age and SuStaIn stage was seen in the brainstem/subcortical-predominant subtype of each proteinopathy. No subtypes were observed for the LATE-NC group, despite aggregating individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease and a larger sample size for this group. Overall, we provide an empirical pathological TDP-43 staging system for ALS, FTLD-TDP and LATE-NC, which yielded accurate classification. We further demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity amongst ALS and FTLD-TDP progression patterns that warrants further investigation in larger cross-cohort studies.",2023,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; frontotemporal lobar degeneration; limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy; machine learning; neuropathological staging,Humans; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Frontotemporal Dementia; Alzheimer Disease; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; DNA-Binding Proteins,"Young, AL; Vogel, JW; Robinson, JL; McMillan, CT; Ossenkoppele, R; Wolk, DA; Irwin, DJ; Elman, L; Grossman, M; Lee, VMY; Lee, EB; Hansson, O"
"Explainable semi-supervised deep learning shows that dementia is associated with small, avocado-shaped clocks with irregularly placed hands.","The clock drawing test is a simple and inexpensive method to screen for cognitive frailties, including dementia. In this study, we used the relevance factor variational autoencoder (RF-VAE), a deep generative neural network, to represent digitized clock drawings from multiple institutions using an optimal number of disentangled latent factors. The model identified unique constructional features of clock drawings in a completely unsupervised manner. These factors were examined by domain experts to be novel and not extensively examined in prior research. The features were informative, as they distinguished dementia from non-dementia patients with an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.86 singly, and 0.96 when combined with participants' demographics. The correlation network of the features depicted the ""typical dementia clock"" as having a small size, a non-circular or ""avocado-like"" shape, and incorrectly placed hands. In summary, we report a RF-VAE network whose latent space encoded novel constructional features of clocks that classify dementia from non-dementia patients with high performance.",2023,,"Humans; Deep Learning; Persea; Neural Networks, Computer; Supervised Machine Learning; Neuropsychological Tests","Bandyopadhyay, S; Wittmayer, J; Libon, DJ; Tighe, P; Price, C; Rashidi, P"

Differential association of cerebral blood flow and anisocytosis in APOE ε4 carriers at midlife.,"Cerebral hemodynamic alterations have been observed in apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4) carriers at midlife, however the physiological underpinnings of this observation are poorly understood. Our goal was to investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its spatial coefficient of variation (CoV) in relation to APOE4 and a measure of erythrocyte anisocytosis (red blood cell distribution width - RDW) in a middle-aged cohort. Data from 563 participants in the PREVENT-Dementia study scanned with 3 T MRI cross-sectionally were analysed. Voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses within nine vascular regions were run to detect areas of altered perfusion. Within the vascular regions, interaction terms between APOE4 and RDW in predicting CBF were examined. Areas of hyperperfusion in APOE4 carriers were detected mainly in frontotemporal regions. The APOE4 allele differentially moderated the association between RDW and CBF, an association which was more prominent in the distal vascular territories (p - [0.01, 0.05]). The CoV was not different between the considered groups. We provide novel evidence that in midlife, RDW and CBF are differentially associated in APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. This association is consistent with a differential hemodynamic response to hematological alterations in APOE4 carriers.",2023,APOE4; CBF; RDW; hemodynamics; perfusion,Humans; Middle Aged; Age Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Erythrocyte Indices; Heterozygote,"Dounavi, ME; Mak, E; Swann, P; Low, A; Muniz-Terrera, G; McKeever, A; Pope, M; Williams, GB; Wells, K; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Malhotra, P; Mackay, C; Koychev, I; Ritchie, K; Su, L; Ritchie, CW; O'Brien, JT"

[Mobile everyday-life digital technologies for the prevention of Alzheimer's dementia: cognitive health and cognitive safety].,"It is generally accepted that the treatment of Alzheimer's disease should be flanked by preventive measures for risk reduction in order to maintain cognitive functions for as long as possible; however, the research and development of treatment concepts are both faced with challenges. The preventive risk reduction necessitates a high level of coordination of neurology and psychiatry with other disciplines. Also, patients must develop a high level of health competence and summon up self-motivation and adherence. This concept article deals with the question of how mobile everyday-life digital technologies can help to address these challenges. The core prerequisite is the interdisciplinary coordinated structuring of prevention with the focus on cognitive health and cognitive safety. Cognitive health relates to a reduction of risk factors associated with lifestyle. Cognitive safety concerns the avoidance of iatrogenic side effects on cognitive functions. Digital technologies that are relevant in this context are mobile apps based on smartphones or tablets for everyday-life and high-frequency recording of cognitive functions, apps that can coach the implementation of lifestyle changes as companion technologies, apps that can assist in the reduction of iatrogenic risks and those that can improve the health competence of patients and relatives. The state of development of such medical products is at different stages of progress. Therefore, this concept article does not provide a review of existing products but rather deals with the fundamental interplay of potential solutions in the prevention of Alzheimer dementia in the areas of cognitive health and cognitive safety.",2023,Health competence; Interdisciplinary medicine; Preventive measures; Risk reduction; Treatment concepts,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Digital Technology; Cognition; Smartphone; Mobile Applications,"Düzel, E; Thyrian, JR"

Distinct and joint effects of low and high levels of Aβ and tau deposition on cortical thickness.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by the presence of Amyloid-β (Aβ),tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN framework) in the human cerebral cortex. Yet, prior studies have suggested that Aβ deposition can be associated with both cortical thinning and thickening. These contradictory results are attributed to small sample sizes, the presence versus absence of tau, and limited detectability in the earliest phase of protein deposition, which may begin in young adulthood and cannot be captured in studies enrolling only older subjects. In this study, we aimed to find the distinct and joint effects of Aβ andtau on neurodegeneration during the progression from normal to abnormal stages of pathologies that remain elusive.

"Unsupervised, frequent and remote: A novel platform for personalised digital phenotyping of long-term memory in humans.","Long-term memory tests are commonly used to facilitate the diagnosis of hippocampal-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease due to their relatively high specificity and sensitivity to damage to the medial temporal lobes compared to standard commonly used clinical tests. Pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease start years before the formal diagnosis is made, partially due to testing too late. This proof-of-concept exploratory study aimed to assess the feasibility of introducing an unsupervised digital platform for continuous testing of long-term memory over long periods outside the laboratory environment. To address this challenge, we developed a novel digital platform, hAge ('healthy Age'), which integrates double spatial alternation, image recognition and visuospatial tasks for frequent remote unsupervised assessment of spatial and non-spatial long-term memory carried out continuously over eight week period. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we tested whether we could achieve sufficient levels of adherence and whether the performance on hAge tasks is comparable to the performance observed in the analogous standard tests measured in the controlled laboratory environments.191 healthy adults (67% females, 18-81 years old) participated in the study. We report an estimated 42.4% adherence level with minimal inclusion criteria. In line with findings using standard laboratory tests, we showed that performance on the spatial alternation task negatively correlated with inter-trial periods and the performance levels on image recognition and visuospatial tasks could be controlled by varying image similarity. Importantly, we demonstrated that frequent engagement with the double spatial alternation task leads to a strong practice effect, previously identified as a potential measure of cognitive decline in MCI patients. Finally, we discuss how lifestyle and motivation confounds may present a serious challenge for cognitive assessment in real-world uncontrolled environments.",2023,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Long-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; Recognition, Psychology; Proof of Concept Study","Bauza, M; Krstulovic, M; Krupic, J"
MultiCens: Multilayer network centrality measures to uncover molecular mediators of tissue-tissue communication.,"With the evolution of multicellularity, communication among cells in different tissues and organs became pivotal to life. Molecular basis of such communication has long been studied, but genome-wide screens for genes and other biomolecules mediating tissue-tissue signaling are lacking. To systematically identify inter-tissue mediators, we present a novel computational approach MultiCens (Multilayer/Multi-tissue network Centrality measures). Unlike single-layer network methods, MultiCens can distinguish within- vs. across-layer connectivity to quantify the ""influence"" of any gene in a tissue on a query set of genes of interest in another tissue. MultiCens enjoys theoretical guarantees on convergence and decomposability, and performs well on synthetic benchmarks. On human multi-tissue datasets, MultiCens predicts known and novel genes linked to hormones. MultiCens further reveals shifts in gene network architecture among four brain regions in Alzheimer's disease. MultiCens-prioritized hypotheses from these two diverse applications, and potential future ones like ""Multi-tissue-expanded Gene Ontology"" analysis, can enable whole-body yet molecular-level systems investigations in humans.",2023,,Humans; Brain; Gene Regulatory Networks; Alzheimer Disease,"Kumar, T; Sethuraman, R; Mitra, S; Ravindran, B; Narayanan, M"

Association between APOE genotype and microglial cell morphology.,"APOE is the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) with E4 conferring an increased risk for AD compared to E3. The ApoE protein can impact diverse pathways in the brain including neuroinflammation but the precise impact of ApoE isoforms on inflammation remains unknown. As microglia are a primary source of neuroinflammation, this study determined whether ApoE isoforms have an impact on microglial morphology and activation using immunohistochemistry and digital analyses. Analysis of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunoreactivity indicated greater microglial activation in both the hippocampus and superior and middle temporal gyrus (SMTG) in dementia participants versus non-demented controls. Further, only an increase in activation was seen in E3-Dementia participants in the entire SMTG, whereas in the grey matter of the SMTG, only a diagnosis of dementia impacted activation. Specific microglial morphologies showed a reduction in ramified microglia in the dementia group. For rod microglia, a reduction was seen in E4-Control patients in the hippocampus whereas in the SMTG an increase was seen in E4-Dementia patients. These findings suggest an association between ApoE isoforms and microglial morphologies and highlight the importance of considering ApoE isoforms in studies of AD pathology.",2023,Alzheimer disease; ApoE; Microglia; Neuropathology,Humans; Microglia; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins E; Genotype; Protein Isoforms; Apolipoprotein E4,"Kloske, CM; Gearon, MD; Weekman, EM; Rogers, C; Patel, E; Bachstetter, A; Nelson, PT; Wilcock, DM"

Sex and gender considerations in Alzheimer's disease: The Women's Brain Project contribution.,"The global population is expected to have about 131.5 million people living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias by 2050, posing a severe health crisis. Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that gradually impairs physical and cognitive functions. Dementia has a variety of causes, symptoms, and heterogeneity concerning the influence of sex on prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes. The proportion of male-to-female prevalence varies based on the type of dementia. Despite some types of dementia being more common in men, women have a greater lifetime risk of developing dementia. AD is the most common form of dementia in which approximately two-thirds of the affected persons are women. Profound sex and gender differences in physiology and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions have increasingly been identified. As a result, new approaches to dementia diagnosis, care, and patient journeys should be considered. In the heart of a rapidly aging worldwide population, the Women's Brain Project (WBP) was born from the necessity to address the sex and gender gap in AD. WBP is now a well-established international non-profit organization with a global multidisciplinary team of experts studying sex and gender determinants in the brain and mental health. WBP works with different stakeholders worldwide to help change perceptions and reduce sex biases in clinical and preclinical research and policy frameworks. With its strong female leadership, WBP is an example of the importance of female professionals' work in the field of dementia research. WBP-led peer-reviewed papers, articles, books, lectures, and various initiatives in the policy and advocacy space have profoundly impacted the community and driven global discussion. WBP is now in the initial phases of establishing the world's first Sex and Gender Precision Medicine Institute. This review highlights the contributions of the WBP team to the field of AD. This review aims to increase awareness of potentially important aspects of basic science, clinical outcomes, digital health, policy framework and provide the research community with potential challenges and research suggestions to leverage sex and gender differences.

Visual-somatosensory integration (VSI) as a novel marker of Alzheimer's disease: A comprehensive overview of the VSI study.,"Identification of novel, non-invasive, non-cognitive based markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are a global priority. Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's pathology manifests in sensory association areas well before appearing in neural regions involved in higher-order cognitive functions, such as memory. Previous investigations have not comprehensively examined the interplay of sensory, cognitive, and motor dysfunction with relation to AD progression. The ability to successfully integrate multisensory information across multiple sensory modalities is a vital aspect of everyday functioning and mobility. Our research suggests that multisensory integration, specifically visual-somatosensory integration (VSI), could be used as a novel marker for preclinical AD given previously reported associations with important motor (balance, gait, and falls) and cognitive (attention) outcomes in aging. While the adverse effect of dementia and cognitive impairment on the relationship between multisensory functioning and motor outcomes has been highlighted, the underlying functional and neuroanatomical networks are still unknown. In what follows we detail the protocol for our study, named The VSI Study, which is strategically designed to determine whether preclinical AD is associated with neural disruptions in subcortical and cortical areas that concurrently modulate multisensory, cognitive, and motor functions resulting in mobility decline. In this longitudinal observational study, a total of 208 community-dwelling older adults with and without preclinical AD will be recruited and monitored yearly. Our experimental design affords assessment of multisensory integration as a new behavioral marker for preclinical AD; identification of functional neural networks involved in the intersection of sensory, motor, and cognitive functioning; and determination of the impact of early AD on future mobility declines, including incident falls. Results of The VSI Study will guide future development of innovative multisensory-based interventions aimed at preventing disability and optimizing independence in pathological aging.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cognition; mobility; multisensory integration; sensory processing,,"Mahoney, JR; Blumen, HM; De Sanctis, P; Fleysher, R; Frankini, C; Hoang, A; Hoptman, MJ; Jin, R; Lipton, M; Nunez, V; Twizer, L; Uy, N; Valdivia, A; Verghese, T; Wang, C; Weiss, EF; Zwerling, J; Verghese, J"
The current state of artificial intelligence-augmented digitized neurocognitive screening test.,"The cognitive screening test is a brief cognitive examination that could be easily performed in a clinical setting. However, one of the main drawbacks of this test was that only a paper-based version was available, which restricts the test to be manually administered and graded by medical personnel at the health centers. The main solution to these problems was to develop a potential remote assessment for screening individuals with cognitive impairment. Currently, multiple studies have been adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology into these tests, evolving the conventional paper-based neurocognitive test into a digitized AI-assisted neurocognitive test. These studies provided credible evidence of the potential of AI-augmented cognitive screening tests to be better and provided the framework for future studies to further improve the implementation of AI technology in the cognitive screening test.

Reduction of human Alzheimer's disease risk and reversal of mouse model cognitive deficit with nucleoside analog use.,"Innate immune signaling through the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia. We previously demonstrated that nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), drugs approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B infections, also inhibit inflammasome activation. Here we report that in humans, NRTI exposure was associated with a significantly lower incidence of AD in two of the largest health insurance databases in the United States. Treatment of aged 5xFAD mice (a mouse model of amyloid-β deposition that expresses five mutations found in familial AD) with Kamuvudine-9 (K-9), an NRTI-derivative with enhanced safety profile, reduced Aβ deposition and reversed their cognitive deficit by improving their spatial memory and learning performance to that of young wild-type mice.

Seed amplification and neurodegeneration marker trajectories in individuals at risk of prion disease.,"Human prion diseases are remarkable for long incubation times followed typically by rapid clinical decline. Seed amplification assays and neurodegeneration biofluid biomarkers are remarkably useful in the clinical phase, but their potential to predict clinical onset in healthy people remains unclear. This is relevant not only to the design of preventive strategies in those at-risk of prion diseases, but more broadly, because prion-like mechanisms are thought to underpin many neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report the accrual of a longitudinal biofluid resource in patients, controls and healthy people at risk of prion diseases, to which ultrasensitive techniques such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and single molecule array (Simoa) digital immunoassays were applied for preclinical biomarker discovery. We studied 648 CSF and plasma samples, including 16 people who had samples taken when healthy but later developed inherited prion disease (IPD) ('converters'; range from 9.9 prior to, and 7.4 years after onset). Symptomatic IPD CSF samples were screened by RT-QuIC assay variations, before testing the entire collection of at-risk samples using the most sensitive assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), tau and UCH-L1 levels were measured in plasma and CSF. Second generation (IQ-CSF) RT-QuIC proved 100% sensitive and specific for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), iatrogenic and familial CJD phenotypes, and subsequently detected seeding activity in four presymptomatic CSF samples from three E200K carriers; one converted in under 2 months while two remain asymptomatic after at least 3 years' follow-up. A bespoke HuPrP P102L RT-QuIC showed partial sensitivity for P102L disease. No compatible RT-QuIC assay was discovered for classical 6-OPRI, A117V and D178N, and these at-risk samples tested negative with bank vole RT-QuIC. Plasma GFAP and NfL, and CSF NfL levels emerged as proximity markers of neurodegeneration in the typically slow IPDs (e.g. P102L), with significant differences in mean values segregating healthy control from IPD carriers (within 2 years to onset) and symptomatic IPD cohorts; plasma GFAP appears to change before NfL, and before clinical conversion. In conclusion, we show distinct biomarker trajectories in fast and slow IPDs. Specifically, we identify several years of presymptomatic seeding positivity in E200K, a new proximity marker (plasma GFAP) and sequential neurodegenerative marker evolution (plasma GFAP followed by NfL) in slow IPDs. We suggest a new preclinical staging system featuring clinical, seeding and neurodegeneration aspects, for validation with larger prion at-risk cohorts, and with potential application to other neurodegenerative proteopathies.",2023,GFAP; NfL; RT-QuIC; inherited; prion,Humans; tau Proteins; Prion Diseases; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Prions; Biomarkers,"Mok, TH; Nihat, A; Majbour, N; Sequeira, D; Holm-Mercer, L; Coysh, T; Darwent, L; Batchelor, M; Groveman, BR; Orr, CD; Hughson, AG; Heslegrave, A; Laban, R; Veleva, E; Paterson, RW; Keshavan, A; Schott, JM; Swift, IJ; Heller, C; Rohrer, JD; Gerhard, A; Butler, C; Rowe, JB; Masellis, M; Chapman, M; Lunn, MP; Bieschke, J; Jackson, GS; Zetterberg, H; Caughey, B; Rudge, P; Collinge, J; Mead, S"
The Future of Cognitive Screening in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Cognitive screening instruments (CSI) have variable sensitivity and specificity to the cognitive changes associated with dementia syndromes, and the most recent systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the benefit of cognitive screening tools in older adults residing within the community. Consequently, there is a critical need to improve CSI methods, which have not yet incorporated advances in psychometrics, neuroscience, and technology. The primary goal of this article is to provide a framework for transitioning from legacy CSIs to advanced dementia screening measurement. In line with ongoing efforts in neuropsychology and the call for next-generation digital assessment for early detection of AD, we propose a psychometrically advanced (including application of item response theory methods), automated selective assessment model that provides a framework to help propel an assessment revolution. Further, we present a three-phase model for modernizing CSIs and discuss critical diversity and inclusion issues, current challenges in differentiating normal from pathological aging, and ethical considerations.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cognitivescreening instruments; dementia; neuropsychology,Humans; Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Aging; Psychometrics; Dementia; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease,"Umfleet, LG; Bilder, RM; Loring, DW; Thames, A; Hampstead, BM; Bauer, RM; Drane, DL; Cavanagh, L"

Localized microglia dysregulation impairs central nervous system myelination in development.,"Myelination of neuronal axons is a critical aspect of central nervous system development and function. However, the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms influencing human developmental myelination and its failure are not fully understood. Here, we used digital spatial transcriptomics of a rare bank of human developing white matter to uncover that a localized dysregulated innate immune response is associated with impeded myelination. We identified that poorly myelinating areas have a distinct signature of Type II interferon signalling in microglia/macrophages, relative to adjacent myelinating areas. This is associated with a surprising increase in mature oligodendrocytes, which fail to form myelin processes appropriately. We functionally link these findings by showing that conditioned media from interferon-stimulated microglia is sufficient to dysregulate myelin process formation by oligodendrocytes in culture. We identify the Type II interferon inducer, Osteopontin (SPP1), as being upregulated in poorly myelinating brains, indicating a potential biomarker. Our results reveal the importance of microglia-mature oligodendrocyte interaction and interferon signaling in regulating myelination of the developing human brain.",2023,Microglia; Myelin; Neuroinflammation; Oligodendrocyte; White matter,Humans; Microglia; Myelin Sheath; Oligodendroglia; Axons; Brain,"Holloway, RK; Zhang, L; Molina-Gonzalez, I; Ton, K; Nicoll, JAR; Boardman, JP; Liang, Y; Williams, A; Miron, VE"

[The Role of Nurses in Bridging the Health Literacy Gap: Empowering Patients in the Post-Pandemic Era].,"Health literacy (HL) is an essential ability used by people throughout life to access, understand, appraise, and apply health related information and services and is widely recognized as a key determinant of health. HL has been the focus of increasing international attention in the 21st century, with the World Health Organization identifying HL as a 2030 sustainable development target (World Health Organization, 2016). ""Strengthening health communication and improving HL nationwide"" is also an issue targeted in a Taiwan government white paper for improvement by 2025. Key related actions and strategies noted in this paper include investigating the HL of each life course; disseminating accurate, easy-to-access, and implementable health and safety information; improving the public's awareness and use of mobile tools; using multiple marketing models (public, organization, interpersonal communication); combining cloud technology to develop a health management system; setting up websites; providing cloud care; and developing other e-media (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2016). The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly challenged the global healthcare system as well as individual health. Due to the difficulties and uncertainties associated with emerging diseases, updating regularly changing information in a timely manner is not easy. Ensuring public access to and application of updated information is a key challenge to improving public HL. Abel & McQueen (2020) pointed out that ""critical health literacy"", the ability of individuals to reflect on complex health issues and critically evaluate available information, will be the key to promoting and enhancing healthy behaviors in response to emerging diseases. Taiwan is rapidly moving toward becoming a super-aged society, at which time frail older adults, individuals with dementia, and individuals with disabilities and multiple chronic diseases are expected to be the primary targets of healthcare system services. During the pandemic, many individuals in vulnerable groups died quickly due to COVID-19-related severe illnesses, leaving their families with insufficient time to respond and adjust. This experience highlights the importance of palliative and end-of-life care communication with clients and of permitting family members to grieve. In addition, disease control measures such as isolation, wearing masks, and reducing visits to patients have also affected communication between people, widening the distance between patients, their families, and healthcare professionals. This experience has made us reflect on how to better use online and mobile tools to support self-care for patients and their families. In this issue, Professor Li first expounds on promoting HL in the elderly through the use of health education strategies such as formulating public policies related to HL, adjusting the orientation of health services, constructing a friendly environment for HL information dissemination, strengthening community resources for HL education, and promoting geriatric learning and shared decision-making. Professor Wu encourages nurses in long-term care facilities to apply the U-R-PEACE strategy to promote understanding, respect, planning, expression, act, care, and education in a manner that facilitates effective palliative care communication with patients and their families as early as possible. Because dementia care relies heavily on family caregivers, Professor Luo suggests using family-caregiver-created and managed Facebook groups to share health information and facilitate social support, shedding light on how to use social media to effectively empower caregivers. Interactions between patients and healthcare professionals are critical to effective healthcare delivery. The unequal power dynamic between physicians and patients may lead to communication conflicts, especially as generational replacement progresses and public health awareness improves. Facing the differences between these two interest groups, Professor Ye suggest nurses handle conflicts proactively by increasing their emotional drive to address disagreements, enhancing their cognitive abilities to handle interpersonal dynamics, and engaging actively in communicative measures.",2023,,"Aged; Humans; Pandemics; Health Literacy; COVID-19; Dementia; Power, Psychological","Kuo, CL"
The effects of a mobile-based multi-domain intervention on cognitive function among older adults.,"Behavioral and social research has stressed the importance of multi-domain lifestyle interventions to prevent, delay, or remedy age-related cognitive decline among older adults at high risk for dementia. In light of the benefits of multi-domain interventions, some studies demonstrate the effectiveness of a mobile-based program for dementia prevention. Unfortunately, there is limited evidence of whether or not a mobile application of a multi-domain program is effective in improving cognitive functioning among older adults who are a high risk for dementia. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a pre-post change of cognition and there were age-group differences in pre-post change after the 12 weeks multi-domain program, ",2023,Cognitive function; Dementia prevention; Digital health; Multi-domain lifestyle intervention,,"Kim, J; Ko, M; Lee, J; Kim, Y"

Early amygdala and ERC atrophy linked to 3D reconstruction of rostral neurofibrillary tau tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Previous research has emphasized the unique impact of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a reflection that tau pathology is particularly striking in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortex (ERC, TEC) early in the course of disease. However, other brain regions are affected by AD pathology during its early phases. Here, we use longitudinal diffeomorphometry to measure the atrophy rate from MRI of the amygdala compared with that in the ERC and TEC in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls, CU individuals who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with MCI who progressed to dementia of the AD type (DAT), using a dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results show significantly higher atrophy rates of the amygdala in both groups of 'converters' (CU→MCI, MCI→DAT) compared to controls, with rates of volume loss comparable to rates of thickness loss in the ERC and TEC. We localize atrophy within the amygdala within each of these groups using fixed effects modeling. Controlling for the familywise error rate highlights the medial regions of the amygdala as those with significantly higher atrophy in both groups of converters than in controls. Using our recently developed method, referred to as Projective LDDMM, we map measures of neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) from digital pathology to MRI atlases and reconstruct dense 3D spatial distributions of NFT density within regions of the MTL. The distribution of NFTs is consistent with the spatial distribution of MR measured atrophy rates, revealing high densities (and atrophy) in the amygdala (particularly medial), ERC, and rostral third of the MTL. The similarity of the location of NFTs in AD and shape changes in a well-defined clinical population suggests that amygdalar atrophy rate, as measured through MRI may be a viable biomarker for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amygdala atrophy; Digital pathology; MRI biomarkers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Temporal Lobe; Amygdala; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Atrophy; Cognitive Dysfunction","Stouffer, KM; Chen, C; Kulason, S; Xu, E; Witter, MP; Ceritoglu, C; Albert, MS; Mori, S; Troncoso, J; Tward, DJ; Miller, MI"

The localization of molecularly distinct microglia populations to Alzheimer's disease pathologies using QUIVER.,"New histological techniques are needed to examine protein distribution in human tissues, which can reveal cell shape and disease pathology connections. Spatial proteomics has changed the study of tumor microenvironments by identifying spatial relationships of immunomodulatory cells and proteins and contributing to the discovery of new cancer immunotherapy biomarkers. However, the fast-expanding toolkit of spatial proteomic approaches has yet to be systematically applied to investigate pathological alterations in the aging human brain in health and disease states. Moreover, post-mortem human brain tissue presents distinct technical problems due to fixation procedures and autofluorescence, which limit fluorescence methodologies. This study sought to develop a multiplex immunohistochemistry approach (visualizing the immunostain with brightfield microscopy). Quantitative multiplex Immunohistochemistry with Visual colorimetric staining to Enhance Regional protein localization (QUIVER) was developed to address these technical challenges. Using QUIVER, a ten-channel pseudo-fluorescent image was generated using chromogen removal and digital microscopy to identify unique molecular microglia phenotypes. Next, the study asked if the tissue environment, specifically the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, has any bearing on microglia's cellular and molecular phenotypes. QUIVER allowed the visualization of five molecular microglia/macrophage phenotypes using digital pathology tools. The recognizable reactive and homeostatic microglia/macrophage phenotypes demonstrated spatial polarization towards and away from amyloid plaques, respectively. Yet, microglia morphology appearance did not always correspond to molecular phenotype. This research not only sheds light on the biology of microglia but also offers QUIVER, a new tool for examining pathological alterations in the brains of the elderly.",2023,Digital pathology; Glia; Histology; Multiplexed tissue imaging; Neurodegenerative disease; Neuropathology; Single-cell analysis,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Microglia; Plaque, Amyloid; Proteomics; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Brain; Tremor; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Shahidehpour, RK; Nelson, AS; Sanders, LG; Embry, CR; Nelson, PT; Bachstetter, AD"

Collaborative Learning through a Virtual Community of Practice in Dementia Care Support: A Scoping Review.,"The aim of this scoping review was to identify, synthesize, and report research on reflective collaborative learning through virtual communities of practice (vCoP), which, to our knowledge, is scarce. A second aim was to identify, synthesize, and report research on the facilitators and barriers associated with resilience capacity and knowledge acquisition through vCoP. The literature was searched in PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (ScR) framework guided the review. Ten studies were included in the review, seven quantitative and three qualitative studies, written in English and published from January 2017 to February 2022. The data were synthesized using a numerical descriptive summary and qualitative thematic analysis. Two themes: 'knowledge acquisition' and 'strengthening resilience capacity' emerged. The literature synthesis provides evidence of a vCoP as a digital space that supports knowledge acquisition and strengthens resilience for persons with dementia, and their informal and formal caregivers. Hence, the use of vCoP seems to be useful for dementia care support. Further studies including less developed countries are, however, needed to enable generalizability of the concept of vCoP across countries.",2023,dementia; formal caregivers; informal caregivers; reflective collaborative learning; resilience capacity; virtual community of practice,,"Dedzoe, JD; Malmgren Fänge, A; Christensen, J; Lethin, C"

Progression of clinical markers in prodromal Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies: a multicentre study.,"The neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, are characterized by a typically lengthy prodromal period of progressive subclinical motor and non-motor manifestations. Among these, idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder is a powerful early predictor of eventual phenoconversion, and therefore represents a critical opportunity to intervene with neuroprotective therapy. To inform the design of randomized trials, it is essential to study the natural progression of clinical markers during the prodromal stages of disease in order to establish optimal clinical end points. In this study, we combined prospective follow-up data from 28 centres of the International REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Study Group representing 12 countries. Polysomnogram-confirmed REM sleep behaviour disorder subjects were assessed for prodromal Parkinson's disease using the Movement Disorder Society criteria and underwent periodic structured sleep, motor, cognitive, autonomic and olfactory testing. We used linear mixed-effect modelling to estimate annual rates of clinical marker progression stratified by disease subtype, including prodromal Parkinson's disease and prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies. In addition, we calculated sample size requirements to demonstrate slowing of progression under different anticipated treatment effects. Overall, 1160 subjects were followed over an average of 3.3 ± 2.2 years. Among clinical variables assessed continuously, motor variables tended to progress faster and required the lowest sample sizes, ranging from 151 to 560 per group (at 50% drug efficacy and 2-year follow-up). By contrast, cognitive, olfactory and autonomic variables showed modest progression with higher variability, resulting in high sample sizes. The most efficient design was a time-to-event analysis using combined milestones of motor and cognitive decline, estimating 117 per group at 50% drug efficacy and 2-year trial duration. Finally, while phenoconverters showed overall greater progression than non-converters in motor, olfactory, cognitive and certain autonomic markers, the only robust difference in progression between Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies phenoconverters was in cognitive testing. This large multicentre study demonstrates the evolution of motor and non-motor manifestations in prodromal synucleinopathy. These findings provide optimized clinical end points and sample size estimates to inform future neuroprotective trials.",2023,Parkinson’s disease; REM sleep behaviour disorder; dementia with Lewy bodies; evolution; prodromal stage,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Lewy Body Disease; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder; Prospective Studies; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; Prodromal Symptoms,"Joza, S; Hu, MT; Jung, KY; Kunz, D; Stefani, A; Dušek, P; Terzaghi, M; Arnaldi, D; Videnovic, A; Schiess, MC; Hermann, W; Lee, JY; Ferini-Strambi, L; Lewis, SJG; Leclair-Visonneau, L; Oertel, WH; Antelmi, E; Sixel-Döring, F; Cochen De Cock, V; Liguori, C; Liu, J; Provini, F; Puligheddu, M; Nicoletti, A; Bassetti, CLA; Bušková, J; Dauvilliers, Y; Ferri, R; Montplaisir, JY; Lawton, M; Kim, HJ; Bes, F; Högl, B; Šonka, K; Fiamingo, G; Mattioli, P; Lavadia, ML; Suescun, J; Woo, KA; Marelli, S; Martens, KE; Janzen, A; Plazzi, G; Mollenhauer, B; Fernandes, M; Li, Y; Cortelli, P; Figorilli, M; Cicero, CE; Schaefer, C; Guiraud, L; Lanza, G; Gagnon, JF; Sunwoo, JS; Ibrahim, A; Girtler, N; Trenkwalder, C; Baldelli, L; Pelletier, A; Postuma, RB"
Alzheimer' disease prediction and classification using CT images through machine learning.,"Numerous surveys using different techniques have been conducted in recent years to accurately classify Alzheimer's disease (AD). This research emphasized the identification of AD through neuroimaging data. However, it is important to identify symptoms as soon as possible when the disease-modifying medications function best during infection before a permanent cognitive impairment develops. The use of automated algorithms to detect the early symptom of AD to this information was very important. Machine Learning (ML) has been proposed for the evaluation of various image segmentation and database techniques. In addition, Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16 et Improved Faster Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (IFRCNN) method developed for the ImageNet database utilizing the mathematical model based on action recognition as a feature extractor for categorization work. Experiments are being conducted on the Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and the proposed system achieves the 98.32 % accuracy level (Tab. 6, Fig. 4, Ref. 34).

[The development of methods to evaluate experimental animal behavior using images].,"In life science and medicine, we have been conducting research using laboratory animals such as mice, rats and monkeys. However, it is impossible for humans to fully understand the feelings and conditions of experimental animals with whom we cannot communicate. In particular, investigators have recently focused on brain function and have created animal models to mimic human depression, pain, and dementia through behavioral tests such as tail suspension and mazes. These methods allow for some evaluation of the animal's condition. However, we cannot detect trivial behavioral changes that reflect the state of mind and body of the animals reproducibly and objectively. With improvements in imaging and information processing technology, it is now possible to photograph animals for extended periods of time and perform sophisticated analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) can also perform learning and inference, or intelligent work (machine learning), for extended periods of time by processing higher levels of information and can find interpretations that humans are unaware of. To bring innovation to life science research using animals, it is necessary to integrate and utilize these technologies to digitize and extensively and deeply evaluate biological information and emotions of experimental animals. We have been developing some basic technologies for experimental animals by applying image analysis technology, AI, and mathematical analysis. In this review, we introduce the technologies we have developed, including the latest reports.",2023,,"Humans; Animals; Mice; Rats; Artificial Intelligence; Behavior, Animal; Animals, Laboratory; Cognition; Models, Animal","Sakamoto, N; Miyazaki, Y; Kobayashi, K; Minato, T; Murata, T"

Is Virtual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy the Future for People with Dementia? An Audit of UK NHS Memory Clinics During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Access to psychosocial interventions for people with dementia, such as Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), has been restricted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some services have shifted to provision via videoconferencing, but the prevalence of this is unknown. This audit aimed to understand provision of virtual CST (vCST) within National Health Service (NHS) memory clinics throughout the UK and Channel Islands and investigate plans for ongoing CST provision. A cross-sectional survey was circulated to NHS memory clinics, which included closed and open-ended questions to generate quantitative and qualitative data. Thirty-three memory clinics responded to the survey. During the pandemic, 55% of respondents offered vCST, whereas 45% offered no CST. Of those offering vCST, 80% plan to continue with a hybrid model of separate face-to-face and vCST groups, whilst 20% intend to deliver face-to-face CST only. Reported positive aspects of vCST were participant and staff enjoyment, perceived improved digital confidence in participants, and improved accessibility for those who cannot attend face-to-face groups. Negative aspects related to digital poverty, limited digital literacy, support needed from carers, the impact of sensory impairment on engagement, and staff time commitment. Virtual CST has been a feasible alternative to face-to-face services during the pandemic but should not completely replace in-person groups. A hybrid approach would increase accessibility for all. Future research should explore efficacy of vCST and seek to understand patterns of exclusion from such digital interventions.",2023,COVID-19; Cognitive stimulation therapy; Dementia; Digital technology; Psychosocial interventions; Telemental health,,"Fisher, E; Proctor, D; Perkins, L; Felstead, C; Stott, J; Spector, A"

We recruited 274 individuals into a community cohort study. Subjects were assessed at baseline and annually with the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II Questionnaire (HPLP-II) and underwent a simple physical assessment. Retinal images were taken using a non-mydriatic digital fundus camera to evaluate the level of WMH estimated by ARIA (ARIA-WMH) to measure the risk of small vessel disease. We calculated the changes from baseline to one year for the six domains of HPLP-II and analysed the relationship with the ARIA-WMH change. A total of 193 (70%) participants completed both the HPLP-II and ARIA-WMH assessments. The mean age was 59.1 ± 9.4 years, and 76.2% (147) were women. HPLP-II was moderate (Baseline, 138.96 ± 20.93; One-year, 141.97 ± 21.85).

Differences of Modality Use between Telepractice and Face-to-Face Administration of the Scenario-Test in Persons with Dementia-Related Speech Disorder.,"Telepractice is increasingly finding its way into the care of people with dementia. Web-based delivery of speech and language therapy (SLT) is feasible and has the potential to improve communication in people with dementia-related speech disorders. Although experts are discussing the strengths and weaknesses of telepractice, a precise analysis of the differences between analogue and digital communication for this heterogeneous group of patients is still missing. The three current single cases investigated verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication in a face-to-face (F2F) and digital setting through a qualitative research design. Using the scenario-test (ST) in person and via big blue button (BBB; video conferencing system), several decisive factors were detected, influencing the effectiveness of communication in a F2F compared to a digital setting. The most important results of the qualitative content analysis are described for each case individually. Additionally, the influence of person-related factors, such as age, diagnosis, presence of depression, and level of education, is presented. Perceptual, executive, and affective disorders, as well as aids of relatives, are considered separately. The results indicate that executive functions, affects, and perceptual deficits need to be taken into account if telepractice is to be applied. Age, education, and distinct forms of dementia might be decisive for successful telepractice as well.",2023,modality use; primary progressive aphasia; telepractice,,"Gauch, M; Corsten, S; Geschke, K; Heinrich, I; Leinweber, J; Spelter, B"

How Well Did the Healthcare System Respond to the Healthcare Needs of Older People with and without Dementia during the COVID-19 Pandemic? The Perception of Healthcare Providers and Older People from the SI4CARE Project in the ADRION Region.,"One major challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic was the limited accessibility to healthcare facilities, especially for the older population. The aim of the current study was the exploration of the extent to which the healthcare systems responded to the healthcare needs of the older people with or without cognitive impairment and their caregivers in the Adrion/Ionian region. Data were collected through e-questionnaires regarding the adequacy of the healthcare system and were anonymously administered to older individuals and stakeholder providers in the following countries: Slovenia, Italy (Calabria), Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Montenegro, and Serbia. Overall, 722 older people and 267 healthcare stakeholders participated in the study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, both healthcare stakeholders and the older population claimed that the healthcare needs of the older people and their caregivers increased dramatically in all countries, especially in Italy (Calabria), Croatia and BiH. According to our results, countries from the Adrion/Ionian regions faced significant challenges to adjust to the special needs of the older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was possibly due to limited accessibility opportunities to healthcare facilities. These results highlight the need for the development of alternative ways of providing medical assistance and supervision when in-person care is not possible.",2023,Adrion–Ionian region; COVID-19 pandemic; accessibility; caregivers; cognitive impairment; dementia; healthcare challenges; healthcare system responses; older people; telemedicine,,"Fragkiadaki, S; Kontaxopoulou, D; Stanitsa, E; Angelopoulou, E; Pavlou, D; Šemrov, D; Colnar, S; Lustrek, M; Blažica, B; Vučica, I; Matković, R; Vukojevic, K; Jelicic, A; Guzzi, PH; Martinović, V; Medina, AP; Piccoli, G; Menon, M; Kozetinac, S; Miljković, M; Kiskini, C; Kokorotsikos, T; Zilidou, V; Radević, I; Papatriantafyllou, J; Thireos, E; Tsouros, A; Dimovski, V; Papageorgiou, SG"

"New horizons in holistic, person-centred health promotion for hearing healthcare.","Over the course of a lifetime, the risk of experiencing multiple chronic conditions (multimorbidity) increases, necessitating complex healthcare regimens. Healthcare that manages these requirements in an integrated way has been shown to be more effective than services that address specific diseases individually. One such chronic condition that often accompanies ageing is hearing loss and related symptoms, such as tinnitus. Hearing loss is not only highly prevalent in older adults but is also a leading cause of disability. Accumulating evidence demonstrates an interplay between auditory function and other aspects of health. For example, poorer cardiometabolic health profiles have been shown to increase the risk of hearing loss, which has been attributed to microvascular disruptions and neural degeneration. Additionally, hearing loss itself is associated with significantly increased odds of falling and is a potentially modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Such evidence warrants consideration of new possibilities-a new horizon-for hearing care to develop a holistic, person-centred approach that promotes the overall health and wellbeing of the individual, as well as for audiology to be part of an interdisciplinary healthcare service. To achieve this holistic goal, audiologists and other hearing healthcare professionals should be aware of the range of conditions associated with hearing loss and be ready to make health promoting recommendations and referrals to the appropriate health practitioners. Likewise, healthcare professionals not trained in audiology should be mindful of their patients' hearing status, screening for hearing loss or referring them to a hearing specialist as required.",2023,cardiovascular disease; dementia; falls; hearing loss; interprofessional care; older people,Humans; Aged; Hearing; Hearing Loss; Delivery of Health Care; Aging; Health Promotion,"Maidment, DW; Wallhagen, MI; Dowd, K; Mick, P; Piker, E; Spankovich, C; Urry, E"

Data-driven neuropathological staging and subtyping of TDP-43 proteinopathies.,"TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) accumulation is the primary pathology underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Charting the progression and heterogeneity of TDP-43 accumulation is necessary to better characterise TDP-43 proteinopathies, but current TDP-43 staging systems are heuristic and assume each syndrome is homogeneous. Here, we use data-driven disease progression modelling to derive a fine-grained empirical staging system for the classification and differentiation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP, n=126), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n=141) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) with and without Alzheimerâ€™s disease (n=304). The data-driven staging of ALS and FTLD-TDP complement and extend previously described human-defined staging schema for ALS and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In LATE-NC individuals, progression along data-driven stages was positively associated with age, but negatively associated with age in individuals with FTLD-TDP. Using only regional TDP-43 severity, our data driven model distinguished individuals diagnosed with ALS, FTLD-TDP or LATE-NC with a cross-validated accuracy of 85.9%, with misclassifications associated with mixed pathological diagnosis, age and genetic mutations. Adding age and SuStaIn stage to this model increased accuracy to 92.3%. Our model differentiates LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP, though some overlap was observed between late-stage LATE-NC and early-stage FTLD-TDP. We further tested for the presence of subtypes with distinct regional TDP-43 progression patterns within each diagnostic group, identifying two distinct cortical-predominant and brainstem-predominant subtypes within FTLD-TDP and a further two subcortical-predominant and corticolimbic-predominant subtypes within ALS. The FTLD-TDP subtypes exhibited differing proportions of TDP-43 type, while there was a trend for age differing between ALS subtypes. Interestingly, a negative relationship between age and SuStaIn stage was seen in the brainstem/subcortical-predominant subtype of each proteinopathy. No subtypes were observed for the LATE-NC group, despite aggregating AD+ and AD-individuals and a larger sample size for this group. Overall, we provide an empirical pathological TDP-43 staging system for ALS, FTLD-TDP and LATE-NC, which yielded accurate classification. We further demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity amongst ALS and FTLD-TDP progression patterns that warrants further investigation in larger cross-cohort studies.",2023,,,"Young, AL; Vogel, JW; Robinson, JL; McMillan, CT; Ossenkoppele, R; Wolk, DA; Irwin, DJ; Elman, L; Grossman, M; Lee, VM; Lee, EB; Hansson, O"
Aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,"Aducanumab is a novel disease-modifying anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) human monoclonal antibody specifically targeted to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was granted for treating AD in June 2021 by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We systematically analyzed available trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab treating AD. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. We conducted an extensive literature search using the electronic databases MEDLINE through PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for suitable studies on aducanumab. We considered human clinical trials of aducanumab, assessing its efficacy and adverse effects in treating AD, excluding any experimental animal studies. We included three randomised controlled trials. Studies reported that aducanumab reduced brain amyloid-beta plaques in a time- and dose-dependent manner (dose-response, P < 0.05) and a slowed decline in cognition (22% reduction) in the high-dose treated group, difference of -0.39 versus placebo in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum Boxes (95% CI, -0.69 to -0.09; P = 0.012) along with a reduced amyloid positron emission tomography standard uptake value ratio score (P < 0.001) and plasma p181-tau (phosphorylated tau) level. Amyloid-related imaging abnormality was reported as a serious adverse event and was profound in high-dose treated group (425/1029 in 10 mg/kg). Aducanumab has been reported to affect two main pathophysiologic hallmarks (Aβ and tau) of AD. We suggest future studies addressing aducanumab's efficacy and safety to confirm that the benefit of this drug outweighs the risk.",2023,Alzheimer disease; aducanumab; aged; drug safety profile; efficacy,"Animals; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Rahman, A; Hossen, MA; Chowdhury, MFI; Bari, S; Tamanna, N; Sultana, SS; Haque, SN; Al Masud, A; Saif-Ur-Rahman, KM"

"Aqueous extract of Ceratonia siliqua L. leaves elicits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and AChE inhibiting effects in amyloid-β42-induced cognitive deficit mice: Role of α7-nAChR in modulating Jak2/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin cascade.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder attributed to several etiological factors including cholinergic dysregulation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, β-amyloidogenesis, and tauopathy. This demands the search for multitarget drugs, especially of natural sources owing to their pleiotropic activities and low adverse effects. The present study was conducted to investigate the cognitive-improving potential of Ceratonia siliqua L. (Cs) extract compared with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on AD-like pathological alterations induced by single intracerebroventricular amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) injection in mice. Aβ42-injected mice were treated with Cs (100 mg/kg/day, po) with or without methyllycaconitine (MLA; 1 mg/kg/day, ip), an α7-nAChR antagonist. Aβ42-injected animals demonstrated an elevation of hippocampal Aβ42, p-Tau, and acetylcholinesterase. They also showed a decline in phosphorylated levels of Jak2, PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β, leading to induction of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Noteworthy, Cs improved the histopathological and behavioral variables in addition to mitigating AD hallmarks. It also exerted neuroprotection by reducing NF-κBp65 and TNF-α, while elevating Nrf2 and HO-1, along with stabilizing β-catenin under the impact of Jak2/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling. These beneficial effects of Cs were abrogated by MLA co-administration signifying the α7-nAChR involvement in Cs-mediated effects. Therefore, Cs can ameliorate Aβ42-induced neurodegeneration by modulating Jak2/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin axis in an α7-nAChR-dependent manner.",2023,Ceratonia siliqua L.; PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β; amyloid-β; mice; α7-nAChR; β-catenin,Mice; Animals; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Antioxidants; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; beta Catenin; Acetylcholinesterase; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Cognition,"El Sayed, NS; Abidar, S; Nhiri, M; Hritcu, L; Ibrahim, WW"

Digital Intervention For The Management Of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial, chronic, neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence and limited therapeutic options, making it a global health crisis. Being the most common cause of dementia, AD erodes the cognitive, functional, and social abilities of the individual and causes escalating medical and psychosocial needs. As yet, this disorder has no cure and current treatment options are palliative in nature. There is an urgent need for novel therapy to address this pressing challenge. Digital therapeutics (Dtx) is one such novel therapy that is gaining popularity globally. Dtx provides evidence based therapeutic interventions driven by internet and software, employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames, apps, sensors, virtual reality aiding in the prevention, management, and treatment of ailments like neurological abnormalities and chronic diseases. Dtx acts as a supportive tool for the optimization of patient care, individualized treatment and improved health outcomes. Dtx uses visual, sound and other non-invasive approaches for instance-consistent therapy, reminiscence therapy, computerised cognitive training, semantic and phonological assistance devices, wearables and computer-assisted rehabilitation environment to find applications in Alzheimer's disease for improving memory, cognition, functional abilities and managing motor symptom. A few of the Dtx-based tools employed in AD include ""Memory Matters"", ""AlzSense"", ""Alzheimer Assistant"", ""smart robotic dog"", ""Immersive virtual reality (iVR)"" and the most current gamma stimulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current trends in digital health in AD and explore the benefits, challenges, and impediments of using Dtx as an adjunctive therapy for the management of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Dementia; Digital health.; Internet of things; Mobile apps; Reminiscence therapy,,"Manchanda, N; Aggarwal, A; Setya, S; Talegaonkar, S"
Developing a music-based digital therapeutic to help manage the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.,"The greying of the world is leading to a rapid acceleration in both the healthcare costs and caregiver burden that are associated with dementia. There is an urgent need to develop new, easily scalable modalities of support. This perspective paper presents the theoretical background, rationale, and development plans for a music-based digital therapeutic to manage the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, particularly agitation and anxiety. We begin by presenting the findings of a survey we conducted with key opinion leaders. The findings highlight the value of a music-based digital therapeutic for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly agitation and anxiety. We then consider the neural substrates of these neuropsychiatric symptoms before going on to evaluate randomized control trials on the efficacy of music-based interventions in their treatment. Finally, we present our development plans for the adaptation of an existing music-based digital therapeutic that was previously shown to be efficacious in the treatment of adult anxiety symptoms.",2023,agitation; anxiety; artificial intelligence; dementia; digital therapeutics; music; neuropsychiatric symptoms,,"Russo, FA; Mallik, A; Thomson, Z; de Raadt St James, A; Dupuis, K; Cohen, D"
Altered functional connectivity of the default mode and dorsal attention network in subjective cognitive decline.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a clinical condition in which performance on standardized cognitive tests does not indicate impairment like mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but self-experienced cognitive capacity persistently declines. We aimed to explore the functional connectivity (FC) characteristics of SCD subjects compared to healthy controls and MCI patients. Resting-state functional MRI was performed on 152 elderly subjects: 65 normal controls, 62 SCD subjects, and 25 MCI patients. A seed-based FC analysis was performed to compare groups. The major brain regions of the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN), large-scale brain networks disrupted in patients with dementia, were selected as seed regions. As a result, the SCD group showed stronger FC than the MCI group between DMN seeds and the supramarginal gyrus. Both the SCD and MCI groups showed stronger FC between the left lateral parietal cortex and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the FC analysis centred on DAN seeds, both the SCD and MCI groups showed weaker FC of the right posterior intraparietal sulcus in the left anterior cingulate cortex and the left insula, compared to those in the control group. Within the SCD group, hyperconnectivity between the right lateral parietal cortex and left supramarginal gyrus was significantly correlated with better performance on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test. In conclusion, the SCD group showed several DMN- and DAN-related FC alterations, similar to the MCI group, but with distinct hyperconnectivity between DMN seeds and the supramarginal gyrus. In particular, SCD has DMN-related FC patterns distinct from those of MCI that are associated with verbal fluency retention.",2023,Default mode network; Functional connectivity; Subjective cognitive decline,Humans; Aged; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Parietal Lobe,"Lee, D; Park, JY; Kim, WJ"

How tablets/applications enhance social connections and social support in people with dementia: A qualitative systematic review.,"The 2020 Lancet issue identified social isolation as one of 12 modifiable risk factors for dementia and revealed that enhanced social connections and social support can effectively reduce the incidence of social isolation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, technology attracted an increasing amount of attention, and it is necessary to synthesize ideas from existing evidence. First, we explored how people with dementia experienced changes in social connection and social support due to tablet/app use. Second, we explored the attitudes of people with dementia towards tablets and mobile applications. Third, we explored the feasibility of using tablets and mobile applications to enhance social connection and social support among people with dementia. We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, CNKI, WanFang, and VIP databases. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies, extracted the data and performed critical appraisals of each included study. The data synthesis was conducted using thematic analysis. A total of nine studies were included. Eight studies used mobile applications via tablets, and one study collected textual data from Twitter for analysis. Four themes were synthesized: (1) change from the perspective of caregivers; (2) growth of nonsingle aspects; (3) emotional feeling of belonging; and (4) feasibility of using digital technology. Tablet- and mobile application-based interventions can enhance both online and offline social connections and provide multiple types of social support among people with dementia.

"A Narrative Review of Current Status and Future Perspective of Telemedicine for Parkinson's Disease, Dementia, and Intractable Neurological Diseases in Japan.","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has uncovered several inherent problems in society. While the demand for telemedicine surged worldwide and some countries responded flexibly, in Japan, most telemedicine services were limited to telephone consultations, and full-fledged telemedicine did not become widespread. In addition, the digitalization process in both medicine and wider society lags behind some other nations. It is necessary to accelerate digital transformation in healthcare to build a sustainable society that is resilient to crises, such as new pandemics. In particular, as Japan is facing an issue of super-aged society, a sustainable care model for people with Parkinson's disease, dementia, and intractable neurological diseases should be established. Many neurodegenerative and intractable neurological diseases are progressive; as the disease progresses, patients could become difficult to visit specialists. Although online medical care has many advantages, it does not provide the same quality of information as face-to-face consultations. However, new technology can overcome the limitations of online medical care. As an evolutionary direction for telemedicine, three-dimensional telemedicine technologies are being developed, which enable online medical treatment to be delivered as if the patient was sharing the same space. Telemonitoring can enable the objective and continuous evaluation of patient information at home through the use of motion capture, wearable devices, and other devices. The advancement of digital transformation in medical care should be a game-changer in accumulating big data and analyzing it using artificial intelligence.",2023,Parkinson's disease; artificial intelligence; dementia; telemedicine; wearable devices,,"Oyama, G; Ogawa, M; Sekimoto, S; Hatano, T; Hattori, N"

The status of digital pathology and associated infrastructure within Alzheimer's Disease Centers.,"Digital pathology (DP) has transformative potential, especially for Alzheimer disease and related disorders. However, infrastructure barriers may limit adoption. To provide benchmarks and insights into implementation barriers, a survey was conducted in 2019 within National Institutes of Health's Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs). Questions covered infrastructure, funding sources, and data management related to digital pathology. Of the 35 ADCs to which the survey was sent, 33 responded. Most respondents (81%) stated that their ADC had digital slide scanner access, with the most frequent brand being Aperio/Leica (62.9%). Approximately a third of respondents stated there were fees to utilize the scanner. For DP and machine learning (ML) resources, 41% of respondents stated none was supported by their ADC. For scanner purchasing and operations, 50% of respondents stated they received institutional support. Some were unsure of the file size of scanned digital images (37%) and total amount of storage space files occupied (50%). Most (76%) were aware of other departments at their institution working with ML; a similar (76%) percentage were unaware of multiuniversity or industry partnerships.

Digital Storytelling as an Intervention for Older Adults: A Scoping Review.,"The population of older adults is rapidly increasing worldwide. Owing to fewer interactions between generations, older adults experience ageism and various psychological issues, such as depression and loneliness. Digital storytelling (DST) has the potential to share vivid lived experiences, support the forming of social relationships, and lead to improved well-being. This scoping review examines the potential psychosocial benefits of individual DST interventions for older adults and people with dementia. We adopted the methodological framework for scoping reviews outlined in the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) manual. A scoping review was performed using the following bibliographic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Research Information Sharing Service, and National Assembly Library. There were 395 references retrieved, of which 19 articles were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our findings revealed that the most common effects of DST on older adults included the promotion of mental health, an increased amount of meaningful community connections, greater digital literacy, the mitigation of negative ageism, and enhanced intellectual ability. We suggest randomized controlled trials are conducted to confirm the efficacy of intergenerational DST intervention and the effects of DST interventions at multilevel outcomes, including the community level.",2023,digital; intergeneration; older adults; review; storytelling,Humans; Aged; Loneliness; Mental Health; Communication,"Chang, H; Do, Y; Ahn, J"

Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers with Crossmodal Augmentation.,"Mild cognitive impairment is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. Its detection has been a critical task for establishing cohort studies and developing therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's. Various types of markers have been developed for detection. For example, imaging markers from neuroimaging have shown great sensitivity, while its cost is still prohibitive for large-scale screening of early dementia. Recent advances from digital biomarkers, such as language markers, have provided an accessible and affordable alternative. While imaging markers give anatomical descriptions of the brain, language markers capture the behavior characteristics of early dementia subjects. Such differences suggest the benefits of auxiliary information from the imaging modality to improve the predictive power of unimodal predictive models based on language markers alone. However, one significant barrier to the joint analysis is that in typical cohorts, there are only very limited subjects that have both imaging and language modalities. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we develop a novel crossmodal augmentation tool, which leverages auxiliary imaging information to improve the feature space of language markers so that a subject with only language markers can benefit from imaging information through the augmentation. Our experimental results show that the multi-modal predictive model trained with language markers and auxiliary imaging information significantly outperforms unimodal predictive models.",2023,,Humans; Computational Biology; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Language; Disease Progression,"Liu, G; Xue, Z; Zhan, L; Dodge, HH; Zhou, J"
The Independent Walking for Brain Health Intervention for Older Adults: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Extensive research suggests that physical activity (PA) is important for brain and cognitive health and may help to delay or prevent Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Most PA interventions designed to improve brain health in older adults have been conducted in laboratory, gym, or group settings that require extensive resources and travel to the study site or group sessions. Research is needed to develop novel interventions that leverage mobile health (mHealth) technologies to help older adults increase their engagement in PA in free-living environments, reducing participant burden and increasing generalizability of research findings. Moreover, promoting engagement in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) may be most beneficial to brain health; thus, using mHealth to help older adults increase time spent in MVPA in free-living environments may help to offset the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and improve quality of life in older age.",2023,adaptive intervention; brain perfusion; clinical trial; cognition; digital health; exercise; feasibility; mechanisms; older adults; real time; real world; seniors,,"Hays Weeks, CC; Moore, AA; Allison, M; Patrick, K; Bondi, MW; Nebeker, C; Liu, TT; Wing, D; Higgins, M; Hartman, SJ; Rissman, RA; Zlatar, ZZ"
The effect of a digital health coaching and health education protocol on cognition in adults at-risk for Alzheimer's.,"Several modifiable lifestyle factors have been linked to cognitive ability and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Health coaching (HC) is an intervention that addresses lifestyle factors associated with cognition. The effectiveness of an HC protocol was evaluated and compared with a health education (HE) intervention, representing the current standard of care, in a sample of 216 adults between the ages of 45 and 75 years who were at-risk for developing ADRD. Outcomes examined were global cognition, neuropsychological cognition, and Alzheimer's risk. HC participants received personalized coaching from a health coach focusing on nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, social engagement, and cognitive activity. HE participants received biweekly education materials focusing on the same modifiable lifestyle factors addressed by HC. Participants were assessed at baseline and again 4 months later. Self-reported global cognition scores improved only in the HC group (16.18 to 15.52, p = .03) and neuropsychological cognitive ability improved in the HE group (104.48 to 108.76, p < .001). When non-adherence in the HC group was accounted for, however, the mean change in neuropsychological score was similar between groups (p > .05), self-reported global cognition demonstrated an even larger mean improvement in the HC group (16.20 to 15.41, p = .01), and the HC group saw an improvement in ADRD protective risk score (- 10.39 to - 11.45, p = .007). These results indicate that HC and HE can both improve cognition, but HC may be more effective and may yield increased protection against ADRD risk.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Alzheimer’s risk; Cognition; Health coaching,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Mentoring; Cognition; Life Style; Health Education,"Campitelli, A; Gills, JL; Jones, MD; Paulson, S; Myers, J; Bryk, K; Madero, EN; Glenn, JM; Rodgers, CH; Kempkes, JA; Gray, M"

Distributional data analysis via quantile functions and its application to modeling digital biomarkers of gait in Alzheimer's Disease.,"With the advent of continuous health monitoring with wearable devices, users now generate their unique streams of continuous data such as minute-level step counts or heartbeats. Summarizing these streams via scalar summaries often ignores the distributional nature of wearable data and almost unavoidably leads to the loss of critical information. We propose to capture the distributional nature of wearable data via user-specific quantile functions (QF) and use these QFs as predictors in scalar-on-quantile-function-regression (SOQFR). As an alternative approach, we also propose to represent QFs via user-specific L-moments, robust rank-based analogs of traditional moments, and use L-moments as predictors in SOQFR (SOQFR-L). These two approaches provide two mutually consistent interpretations: in terms of quantile levels by SOQFR and in terms of L-moments by SOQFR-L. We also demonstrate how to deal with multi-modal distributional data via Joint and Individual Variation Explained using L-moments. The proposed methods are illustrated in a study of association of digital gait biomarkers with cognitive function in Alzheimers disease. Our analysis shows that the proposed methods demonstrate higher predictive performance and attain much stronger associations with clinical cognitive scales compared to simple distributional summaries.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Gait; JIVE; L-Moments; Quantile functions; Scalar-on-quantile-function regression; Wearable data,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gait; Wearable Electronic Devices; Data Analysis,"Ghosal, R; Varma, VR; Volfson, D; Hillel, I; Urbanek, J; Hausdorff, JM; Watts, A; Zipunnikov, V"

Molecular states during acute COVID-19 reveal distinct etiologies of long-term sequelae.,"Post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are debilitating, clinically heterogeneous and of unknown molecular etiology. A transcriptome-wide investigation was performed in 165 acutely infected hospitalized individuals who were followed clinically into the post-acute period. Distinct gene expression signatures of post-acute sequelae were already present in whole blood during acute infection, with innate and adaptive immune cells implicated in different symptoms. Two clusters of sequelae exhibited divergent plasma-cell-associated gene expression patterns. In one cluster, sequelae associated with higher expression of immunoglobulin-related genes in an anti-spike antibody titer-dependent manner. In the other, sequelae associated independently of these titers with lower expression of immunoglobulin-related genes, indicating lower non-specific antibody production in individuals with these sequelae. This relationship between lower total immunoglobulins and sequelae was validated in an external cohort. Altogether, multiple etiologies of post-acute sequelae were already detectable during SARS-CoV-2 infection, directly linking these sequelae with the acute host response to the virus and providing early insights into their development.",2023,,"Humans; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Antibodies, Viral","Thompson, RC; Simons, NW; Wilkins, L; Cheng, E; Del Valle, DM; Hoffman, GE; Cervia, C; Fennessy, B; Mouskas, K; Francoeur, NJ; Johnson, JS; Lepow, L; Le Berichel, J; Chang, C; Beckmann, AG; Wang, YC; Nie, K; Zaki, N; Tuballes, K; Barcessat, V; Cedillo, MA; Yuan, D; Huckins, L; Roussos, P; Marron, TU; Glicksberg, BS; Nadkarni, G; Heath, JR; Gonzalez-Kozlova, E; Boyman, O; Kim-Schulze, S; Sebra, R; Merad, M; Gnjatic, S; Schadt, EE; Charney, AW; Beckmann, ND"

Actual Telemedicine Needs of Japanese Patients with Neurological Disorders in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Objective During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many social activities have moved online using applications for digital devices (e.g. computers, smartphones). We investigated the needs of telemedicine and trends in medical status and social care situations of Japanese patients with neurological disorders in order to estimate their affinity for an online telemedicine application. Methods We designed an original questionnaire for the present study that asked participants what problems they had with hospital visits, how the COVID-19 pandemic had affected their lives, and whether or not they would like to receive telemedicine. Patients The present study included volunteer caregivers, participants with Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, stroke, dementia, immune-mediated neurological disease (IMMD), spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), headache, myopathy, and other neurological diseases from Okayama University Hospital. Results A total of 29.6% of patients wanted to use telemedicine. Patients with headaches (60.0%) and epilepsy (38.1%) were more likely to want to use telemedicine than patients with PD (17.8%) or stroke (19.0%). Almost 90% of patients had access to a digital device, and there was no association between favoring telemedicine, ownership of a digital device, hospital visiting time, or waiting time at the hospital, although age was associated with motivation to telemedicine use (52.6 vs. 62.2 years old, p<0.001).

Improving generalizability and study design of Alzheimer's disease cohort studies in the United States by including under-represented populations.,"The poor generalizability of clinical research data due to the enrollment of highly educated, non-Latinx White participants hampers the development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Black and Latinx older adults have a greater risk for dementia, yet it is unclear how health-care disparities and sociocultural factors influence potential AD therapies and prognosis. Low enrollment of under-represented populations may be attributable to several factors including greater exclusion due to higher rates of comorbidities, lower access to AD clinics, and the legacy of unethical treatment in medical research. This perspective outlines solutions tested in the Brain Health Registry (BHR) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including culturally-informed digital research methods, community-engaged research strategies, leadership from under-represented communities, and the reduction of exclusion criteria based on comorbidities. Our successes demonstrate that it is possible to increase the inclusion and engagement of under-represented populations into US-based clinical studies, thereby increasing the generalizability of their results.",2023,,Humans; United States; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Research Design; Neuroimaging; Brain; Cohort Studies,"Mindt, MR; Okonkwo, O; Weiner, MW; Veitch, DP; Aisen, P; Ashford, M; Coker, G; Donohue, MC; Langa, KM; Miller, G; Petersen, R; Raman, R; Nosheny, R"

Transcranial deep-tissue phototherapy for Alzheimer's disease using low-dose X-ray-activated long-afterglow scintillators.,"Non-invasive phototherapy has been emerging as an ambitious tactic for suppression of amyloid-β (Aβ) self-assembly against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains a daunting challenge to develop efficient photosensitizers for Aβ oxygenation that are activatable in a deep brain tissue through the scalp and skull, while reducing side effects on normal tissues. Here, we report an Aβ targeted, low-dose X-ray-excitable long-afterglow scintillator (ScNPs@RB/Ab) for efficient deep-brain phototherapy. We demonstrate that the as-synthesized ScNPs@RB/Ab is capable of converting X-rays into visible light to activate the photosensitizers of rose bengal (RB) for Aβ oxygenation through the scalp and skull. We show that the ScNPs@RB/Ab persistently emitting visible luminescence can substantially minimize the risk of excessive X-ray exposure dosage. Importantly, peptide KLVFFAED-functionalized ScNPs@RB/Ab shows a blood-brain barrier permeability. In vivo experimental results validated that ScNPs@RB/Ab alleviated Aβ burden and slowed cognitive decline in triple-transgenic AD model mice at extremely low X-ray doses without side effects. Our study paves a new pathway to develop high-efficiency transcranial AD phototherapy.

Lycopene: Sojourn from kitchen to an effective therapy in Alzheimer's disease.,"Reports on a significant positive correlation between consumption of carotenoid-rich food and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) led to the investigation of carotenoids for the treatment and prevention of AD. More than 1100 types of carotenoids are found naturally, out of which only around 50 are absorbed and metabolized in human body. Lycopene is one of the most commonly ingested members of fat-soluble carotenoid family that gives vegetables and fruits their red, yellow, or orange color. Lycopene has established itself as a promising therapy for AD owing to its neuroprotective activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiamyloidogenic properties. In this review, we highlight the various in vitro and preclinical studies demonstrating the neuroprotective effect of lycopene. Also, some epidemiological and interventional studies investigating the protective effect of lycopene in AD have been discussed. Diving deeper, we also discuss various significant mechanisms, through which lycopene exerts its remissive effects in AD. Finally, to overcome the issue of poor chemical stability and bioavailability of lycopene, some of the novel delivery systems developed for lycopene have also been briefly highlighted.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; lycopene; neuroinflammation; neuroprotective; oxidative stress,Humans; Lycopene; Alzheimer Disease; Carotenoids; Antioxidants,"Kapoor, B; Gulati, M; Rani, P; Kochhar, RS; Atanasov, AG; Gupta, R; Sharma, D; Kapoor, D"

The use of technology for arts-based activities in older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or dementia: A scoping review.,"For older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, creative arts-based activities can offer many benefits from enjoyment as leisure/recreation to an avenue to maintain cognitive, social and emotional wellbeing. With growing interest and recognition that technology could have potential to assist in delivering these activities in more accessible and personalised ways, a scoping review was undertaken to systematically examine the scientific literature for technology-assisted creative arts activities for older adults living with dementia. We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and ACM Digital Library databases using keywords centering on population with dementia, an intervention using technology, and a context of creative arts, with no restrictions on the type of outcome measured. We retrieved 3739 records, with an additional 22 from hand-searching. 51 full-text articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Findings of the review indicate technologies principally being designed for music activities (listening, and music-making), as well as storytelling and visual arts. The majority of devices were custom-made, with studies mainly reporting on validating the success of the device/intervention. This suggests most work in the field is currently at prototyping stage, although a few devices are now commercially available. Recommendations for future research includes involvement of participants reporting on their previous experiences in the arts and how this influences co-design choices, and inclusion of different severities of dementia in the participant/co-design group. Furthering device development past prototyping stage as well as collaboration between teams would enable comparisons to be made across different types of devices used for the same activity, and comparisons across arts-based activities that could lead to cross-disciplinary outcomes for the design of creative arts-based assistive technologies.",2023,arts; dementia; mild cognitive impairment; scoping review; technology,Humans; Aged; Dementia; Cognitive Dysfunction; Music; Communication; Technology,"MacRitchie, J; Floridou, GA; Christensen, J; Timmers, R; de Witte, L"

Why a clinical trial is as good as its outcome measure: A framework for the selection and use of cognitive outcome measures for clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease.,"A crucial aspect of any clinical trial is using the right outcome measure to assess treatment efficacy. Compared to the rapidly evolved understanding and measurement of pathophysiology in preclinical and early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), relatively less progress has been made in the evolution of clinical outcome assessments (COAs) for those stages. The current paper aims to provide a benchmark for the design and evaluation of COAs for use in early AD trials. We discuss lessons learned on capturing cognitive changes in predementia stages of AD, including challenges when validating novel COAs for those early stages and necessary evidence for their implementation in clinical trials. Moving forward, we propose a multi-step framework to advance the use of more effective COAs to assess clinically meaningful changes in early AD, which will hopefully contribute to the much-needed consensus around more appropriate outcome measures to assess clinical efficacy of putative treatments. HIGHLIGHTS: We discuss lessons learned on capturing cognitive changes in predementia stages of AD.

Bridging gaps in the design and implementation of socially assistive technologies for dementia care: the role of occupational therapy.,"Dementia is a global health challenge, and people living with dementia (PLWD) are especially susceptible to reduced engagement in meaningful occupations, including social participation. In the past few decades, socially assistive technologies continue to be developed amidst a rapidly evolving technological landscape to support the social health of PLWD and their caregivers. Examples include social robots, virtual reality, smart home technology, and various digital technologies, such as mobile applications for tablets and smartphones. Despite an increasing body of research and interest in this field, several gaps relating to the design and implementation process of socially assistive technologies continue to undermine their relevance for PLWD in daily life. In this paper, some of these gaps are highlighted and the role of occupational therapy in the design and implementation of socially assistive technology is presented. In the design process, occupational therapists are uniquely skilled to advise and advocate for the tailoring and personalisation of technology to address the occupational needs of PLWD. In the implementation of socially assistive technologies, occupational therapists are skilled to educate, train, and conduct ongoing evaluations with PLWD and their caregivers, to incorporate socially assistive technologies into their routine and daily lives. We recommend that occupational therapists should continue to be acquainted with such technologies through continuous professional development and educational curricula. Moreover, we highlight the necessary collaboration between occupational therapists, technology developers, and researchers to enhance the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology, so that their relevance for PLWD and their caregivers can be maximised.Implications for rehabilitationDevelopers and designers of socially assistive technology should consider the disease trajectory of different types of dementia, as well as the different needs, abilities, preferences, occupations and routines of people living with dementia (PLWD) and/or their caregivers.Collaborations between technology developers, researchers, and occupational therapists should take place iteratively throughout the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology to maximise their relevance and applicability for people living with dementia and their caregivers.To continue enhancing the current role of occupational therapy in socially assistive technology provision, occupational therapists should keep up to date with socially assistive technology that are being developed to support the social health of PLWD.",2024,Occupational therapy; dementia; design; digital technology; emerging technologies; implementation; smart home technology; social robots; socially assistive technology; virtual reality,Humans; Dementia; Occupational Therapy; Caregivers; Occupational Therapists; Self-Help Devices,"Koh, WQ; Heins, P; Flynn, A; Mahmoudi Asl, A; Garcia, L; Malinowsky, C; Brorsson, A"

"Digital histological morphometry of the human pineal gland in a postmortem study, with endocrine and neurological clinical implications.","The pineal gland is a small-sized, photo neuroendocrine organ in the midline of the brain that synthesises and secretes melatonin and serotonin. Chords and islands of pinealocytes constitute the secretory parenchyma, while glial tissue and calcifications represent degenerative changes. This study examined human postmortem pineal glands to microscopically assess morphological changes possibly associated with clinical data, by using digital techniques. A retrospective autopsy study has been performed on 72 paediatric and adult autopsy cases. The glands have been processed for histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining with synaptophysin (SYN), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and neurofilament (NF). Slides were digitally scanned. Morphometric data were obtained using CaseViewer and ImageJ. The comorbidities used for correlation with morphometric data were obesity, type 2 diabetes, adrenal gland adenoma, goitre, chronic pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, and mixed dementia. Thirty-three females and 39 males were included in the study. Increased secretory parenchyma was found in patients with chronic pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, and adrenal gland adenoma. Reduced activity was found in patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity, advanced pineal calcification, mixed dementia, and old age. There were no changes associated with goitre, cachexia, or Willis's polygon atherosclerosis. No significant differences between gender were found. The activity of the pineal gland can be assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry of neuroendocrine and structural pinealocyte markers and observation of glial tissue and calcifications. There is a need for further research to evaluate the clinical impact of these morphological changes on the neuroendocrine systems, with clinical implications in endocrinology, neurology, and even psychiatry.

Amyloid Beta Peptide-Mediated Alterations in Mitochondrial Dynamics and its Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, compromising cognitive function in patients, with an average incidence of 1-3% in the open population. Protein aggregation into amyloidogenic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as neurodegeneration in the hippocampal and cortical areas, represent the neuropathological hallmarks of this disorder. Mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration include protein misfolding, augmented apoptosis, disrupted molecular signaling pathways and axonal transport, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, among others. It is precisely through a disrupted energy metabolism that neural cells trigger toxic mechanisms leading to cell death. In this regard, the study of mitochondrial dynamics constitutes a relevant topic to decipher the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurological disorders, especially when considering that amyloid-beta peptides can target mitochondria. Specifically, the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, known to accumulate in the brain of AD patients, has been shown to disrupt overall mitochondrial metabolism by impairing energy production, mitochondrial redox activity, and calcium homeostasis, thus highlighting its key role in the AD pathogenesis. In this work, we review and discuss recent evidence supporting the concept that mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by amyloid peptides contributes to the development of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta-peptide; energy metabolism alterations; mitochondrial function; mitophagy; neurodegeneration; protein aggregation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Mitochondria,"Monsalvo-Maraver, LÁ; Maya-López, M; Rangel-López, E; Túnez, I; Tinkov, AA; Skalny, A; Ferrer, B; Aschner, M; Santamaría, A"
Machine Learning-Based Identification of Target Groups for Thrombectomy in Acute Stroke.,"Whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) improves functional outcome in patients with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke that do not comply with inclusion criteria of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but that are considered for EVT in clinical practice is uncertain. We aimed to systematically identify patients with LVO stroke underrepresented in RCTs who might benefit from EVT. Following the premises that (i) patients without reperfusion after EVT represent a non-treated control group and (ii) the level of reperfusion affects outcome in patients with benefit from EVT but not in patients without treatment benefit, we systematically assessed the importance of reperfusion level on functional outcome prediction using machine learning in patients with LVO stroke treated with EVT in clinical practice (N = 5235, German-Stroke-Registry) and in patients treated with EVT or best medical management from RCTs (N = 1488, Virtual-International-Stroke-Trials-Archive). The importance of reperfusion level on outcome prediction in an RCT-like real-world cohort equaled the importance of EVT treatment allocation for outcome prediction in RCT data and was higher compared to an unselected real-world population. The importance of reperfusion level was magnified in patient groups underrepresented in RCTs, including patients with lower NIHSS scores (0-10), M2 occlusions, and lower ASPECTS (0-5 and 6-8). Reperfusion level was equally important in patients with vertebrobasilar as with anterior LVO stroke. The importance of reperfusion level for outcome prediction identifies patient target groups who likely benefit from EVT, including vertebrobasilar stroke patients and among patients underrepresented in RCT patients with low NIHSS scores, low ASPECTS, and M2 occlusions.",2023,Endovascular thrombectomy; Machine learning; Outcome prediction; Real-world data; Stroke,Humans; Treatment Outcome; Endovascular Procedures; Stroke; Thrombectomy; Thrombolytic Therapy; Ischemic Stroke; Brain Ischemia,"Quandt, F; Flottmann, F; Madai, VI; Alegiani, A; Küpper, C; Kellert, L; Hilbert, A; Frey, D; Liebig, T; Fiehler, J; Goyal, M; Saver, JL; Gerloff, C; Thomalla, G; Tiedt, S"
"Creating Meaningful Interactions for Young Children, Older Friends, and Nursery School Practitioners within an Intergenerational Project.","Intergenerational practice, where children and older adults come together for shared activities, has grown in popularity in many Western countries. However, research about intergenerational practice, particularly in the UK, is limited. This paper reports on the findings from an exploratory case study about a small intergenerational project between a maintained nursery school and a residential care home for older adults with dementia in the South-East of England. The methodology was informed by a narrative dialogic approach drawing on the work of Bakhtin. Data was collected using naturalistic observations of children's weekly visits to the care home and qualitative interviews with nursery school practitioners. The analysis explores how meaningful interactions were created between the children, the older adults, and the nursery school practitioners. Our findings suggest that singing, unstructured moments, continuity, context (open spaces/flexible sessions), and objects contribute to meaningful interactions between young children and older adults. The ability to be flexible and ""go with the moment"" were identified as key skills for practitioners supporting children and older adults. We conclude that intergenerational projects afford benefits not just for children and older adults, but also for practitioners in the form of ""emotional rewards"". The importance of re-establishing intergenerational practice is recognised, as well as the ways in which barriers created by social distancing might safely be addressed through the use of outdoor spaces and digital technologies.",2023,Early childhood; Intergenerational practice; Nursery school; Nursery school practitioners; Older people; Young children,,"Lyndon, S; Moss, H"
The experiences of carers in supporting a person living with dementia to participate in virtual cognitive stimulation therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is an evidence-based group intervention for people with dementia. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many existing CST groups moved virtually and this required carers of people living with dementia to assist with setting up the appropriate technology.

Assessing prospective and retrospective metacognitive accuracy following traumatic brain injury remotely across cognitive domains.,"The ability to monitor one's behaviour is frequently impaired following TBI, impacting on patients' rehabilitation. Inaccuracies in judgement or self-reflection of one's performance provides a useful marker of metacognition. However, metacognition is rarely measured during routine neuropsychology assessments and how it varies across cognitive domains is unclear. A cohort of participants consisting of 111 TBI patients [mean age = 45.32(14.15), female = 29] and 84 controls [mean age = 31.51(12.27), female = 43] was studied. Participants completed cognitive assessments via a bespoke digital platform on their smartphones. Included in the assessment were a prospective evaluation of memory and attention, and retrospective confidence judgements of task performance. Metacognitive accuracy was calculated from the difference between confidence judgement of task performance and actual performance. Prospective judgment of attention and memory was correlated with task performance in these domains for controls but not patients. TBI patients had lower task performance in processing speed, executive functioning and working memory compared to controls, maintaining high confidence, resulting in overestimation of cognitive performance compared to controls. Additional judgments of task performance complement neuropsychological assessments with little additional time-cost. These results have important theoretical and practical implications for evaluation of metacognitive impairment in TBI patients and neurorehabilitation.",2023,Traumatic brain injury; memory; metacognition; processing speed; remote cognitive assessment; self-awareness,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Metacognition; Retrospective Studies; Executive Function; Judgment; Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Bourke, NJ; Trender, W; Hampshire, A; Lai, H; Demarchi, C; David, M; Hellyer, P; Sharp, DJ; Friedland, D"
