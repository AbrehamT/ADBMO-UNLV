Characterisation of LPS+ bacterial extracellular vesicles along the gut-hepatic portal vein-liver axis.,"Gut microbiome dysbiosis is a major contributing factor to several pathological conditions. However, the mechanistic understanding of the communication between gut microbiota and extra-intestinal organs remains largely elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), secreted by almost every form of life, including bacteria, could play a critical role in this inter-kingdom crosstalk and are the focus of present study. Here, we present a novel approach for isolating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+ bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEV",2024,bacterial extracellular vesicles; dysbiosis; gut microbiome; inflammation; lipopolysaccharide,"Animals; Extracellular Vesicles; Liver; Lipopolysaccharides; Mice; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Portal Vein; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Male; Bacteria; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Obesity; Feces; Dysbiosis","Jain, H; Kumar, A; Almousa, S; Mishra, S; Langsten, KL; Kim, S; Sharma, M; Su, Y; Singh, S; Kerr, BA; Deep, G"
GV-971 attenuates the progression of neuromyelitis optica in murine models and reverses alterations in gut microbiota and associated peripheral abnormalities.,"Growing evidence suggests that an imbalanced gut microbiota composition plays a crucial role in the development of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), an inflammatory demyelinating disease primarily affecting the optic nerves and central nervous system (CNS). In light of this, we explored the potential therapeutic benefits of GV-971 in NMOSD.

An emerging role for the gut microbiome in tauopathy.,"Tauopathies constitute a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal aggregation of the protein tau, progressive neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive and motor impairment. In this review, we will highlight the latest efforts investigating the intricate interplay between the gut microbiome and tauopathies. We discuss the physiological interactions between the microbiome and the brain as well as clinical and experimental evidence that suggests that the presence of tauopathy alters the composition of gut microbiota. We explore both animal and human studies that define causative relationships between the gut microbiome and tauopathy by directly manipulating or transferring gut microbiota. This review highlights future directions into identifying and mechanistically elucidating microbial species causally linked to tauopathies, with an ultimate goal of devising therapeutic targets towards the gut microbiome to treat tauopathies.",2024,Fecal matter transplantation; Gut microbiome; Microbial metabolite; Tauopathies,,"Zhu, Y; Self, WK; Holtzman, DM"
Serum and CSF metabolomics analysis shows Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates risk factors of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a person's dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KD's metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.",2024,Diseases; Metabolomics,,"Schweickart, A; Batra, R; Neth, BJ; Martino, C; Shenhav, L; Zhang, AR; Shi, P; Karu, N; Huynh, K; Meikle, PJ; Schimmel, L; Dilmore, AH; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Blach, C; Dorrestein, PC; Knight, R; Craft, S; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Krumsiek, J"
Microbiome-driven alterations in metabolic pathways and impaired cognition in aged female TgF344-AD rats.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) not only affects cognition and neuropathology, but several other facets capable of negatively impacting quality of life and potentially driving impairments, including altered gut microbiome (GMB) composition and metabolism. Aged (20 + mo) female TgF344-AD and wildtype rats were cognitively characterized on several tasks incorporating several cognitive domains, including task acquisition, object recognition memory, anxiety-like behaviors, and spatial navigation. Additionally, metabolic phenotyping, GMB sequencing throughout the intestinal tract (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and feces), neuropathological burden assessment and marker gene functional abundance predictions (PICRUSt2) were conducted. TgF344-AD rats demonstrated significant cognitive impairment in multiple domains, as well as regionally specific GMB dysbiosis. Relationships between peripheral factors were investigated using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), revealing correlations between GMB changes and both cognitive and metabolic factors. Moreover, communities of gut microbes contributing to essential metabolic pathways were significantly altered in TgF344-AD rats. These data indicate dysbiosis may affect cognitive outcomes in AD through alterations in metabolism-related enzymatic pathways that are necessary for proper brain function. Moreover, these changes were mostly observed in intestinal segments required for carbohydrate digestion, not fecal samples. These data support the targeting of intestinal and microbiome health for the treatment of AD.",2024,Aging; Alzheimer’s; Cognitive decline; Metabolism; Microbiome,,"Hernandez, AR; Parker, E; Babar, M; Banerjee, A; Ding, S; Simley, A; Buford, TW"
Modulation of gut microbiome in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases: A systematic review.,"Microbiota plays an essential role in maintaining body health, through positive influences on metabolic, defensive, and trophic processes and on intercellular communication. Imbalance in intestinal flora, with the proliferation of harmful bacterial species (dysbiosis) is consistently reported in chronic illnesses, including neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Correcting dysbiosis can have a beneficial impact on the symptoms and evolution of ND. This review examines the effects of microbiota modulation through administration of probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, or prebiotics' metabolites (postbiotics) in patients with ND like multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",2024,Microbiota; Neurodegenerative diseases; Postbiotics; Prebiotics; Probiotics; Psychobiotics,Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Probiotics; Prebiotics; Dysbiosis; Animals; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation,"Mincic, AM; Antal, M; Filip, L; Miere, D"
Armillariella tabescens-derived polysaccharides alleviated Ɒ-Gal-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive injury through enterocerebral axis and activation of keap-1/Nrf2 pathway.,"The early symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases include oxidative stress disorder and accelerated inflammation levels. Edible fungi polysaccharides play essential roles in anti-neuroinflammation. We analyzed the regulatory mechanisms of polysaccharides from extracellular Armillariella tabescens (ATEP) in alleviating neuroinflammation in mice. Mice were induced with d-galactose and aluminum chloride to establish an animal model of Alzheimer's disease, then intragastrically treated with ATEP, which had been previously analyzed for its physicochemical properties. We assessed the critical characteristics of mice treated for neuroinflammation, including cognitive behavior, the anti-inflammatory potential of ATEP in hippocampal pathology and critical protein expression, and changes in fecal microbial composition and metabolites. ATEP intervened in oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities and suppressing the Keap-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Changing the Nrf2 content in the nucleus led to changes in the downstream oxidation-related enzymes, HO-1, NQO-1, iNOS, and COX-2, and the neuronal morphology in CA3 region of the hippocampus. Microbiome analysis revealed that ATEP remodeled the gut microbiotas and regulated the short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria. Early intervention with ATEP via active dietary supplementation may promote neuroprotection.",2024,Armillariella tabescens; Gut microbiota; Neuroinflammation; Polysaccharides; Short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs),"Animals; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Mice; Signal Transduction; Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1; Polysaccharides; Oxidative Stress; Male; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Hippocampus; Galactose; Cognitive Dysfunction; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Disease Models, Animal; Fungal Polysaccharides; Alzheimer Disease","Du, MR; Zhang, QY; Yang, SY; Chen, JQ; Dan, CM; Lian, LD; Wang, J"

Regulating effect of Qifu Yin on intestinal microbiota in mice with memory impairment induced by scopolamine hydrobromide.,"Qifu Yin (QFY) originates from ""Jingyue Quanshu · Volume 51 · New Fang Bazhen · Buzhen"" a work by Zhang Jingyue, a distinguished Chinese medical practitioner from the Ming Dynasty. QFY is composed of Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle, Ziziphi Spinosae Semen, and Polygalae Radix. QFY is frequently employed to address memory loss and cognitive impairment stemming from vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related conditions. Our findings indicate that QFY can mitigate nerve cell damage. Moreover, the study explores the impact of QFY on the calcium ion pathway and sphingolipid metabolism in mice with myocardial infarction, presenting a novel perspective on QFY's mechanism in ameliorating myocardial infarction through lipidomics.

[Experimental study on improvement of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease by different degrees of steaming and sunning of Polygoni Multiflori Radix based on fecal metabolomics].,"The fecal metabolomics method was employed to investigate the cognitive improvement mechanism of Polygoni Multiflori Radix in Alzheimer's disease(AD) and examine the effects of different degrees of steaming and sunning on cognitive function in AD model mice. Additionally, the processing principle of Polygoni Multiflori Radix was discussed. Forty-eight 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice were randomly assigned to the following groups: model group, positive group, raw product group, three-steaming and three-sunning product group, six-steaming and six-sunning product group, and nine-steaming and nine-sunning product group. Seven negative control mice from the same litter were included as the blank group. After 150 days of intragastric administration, the learning and memory abilities of mice in each group were assessed by using the Barnes maze and dark avoidance tests. Fecal samples were collected for extensive targeted metabolomics testing. Principal component analysis(PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA), and other multivariate statistical methods were utilized to analyze metabolites in mouse feces. Comparison of behavioral results between the model group and different product groups demonstrated that the six-steaming and six-sunning product group exhibited significantly reduced latency in the Barnes maze positioning and navigation test(P&lt;0.05), as well as a notable decrease in the number of errors in the space exploration experiment(P&lt;0.05). Moreover, the latency of mice entering the dark box for the first time in the dark avoidance experiment was significantly prolonged(P&lt;0.05), indicating the best overall improvement in the learning and memory ability of AD model mice. Metabolomics results revealed that compared with the model group, the differential metabolites in other groups in descending order were as follows: six-steaming and six-sunning product group &gt; nine-steaming and nine-sunning product group &gt; raw product group &gt; three-steaming and three-sunning product group, encompassing 146, 120, 95, and 81 potential biomarkers, respectively. Among them, 16 differential metabolites were related to AD disease. Further comparisons based on the degree of processing indicated that the six-steaming and six-sunning product group exhibited the most significant adjustments in total metabolic pathways, particularly regulating the interconversion of pentose and glucuronic acid, as well as amino acid anabolism and other pathways. In summary, the mechanism of Polygoni Multiflori Radix after processing in enhancing the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice may be associated with improved amino acid metabolism and increased energy metabolism in the body. The six-steaming and six-sunning yielded the best outcomes.",2024,Alzheimer′s disease; Polygoni Multiflori Radix; amino acid metabolism; energy metabolism; fecal metabolomics; steaming and sunning,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Mice; Metabolomics; Feces; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Cognitive Dysfunction; Male; Polygonum; Humans; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Cognition","Zhou, GL; Li, SY; Luo, X; Chen, H; Chi, XY; Liu, SL; Yang, K; Zeng, CH"
[Advances in the application of fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of nervous system diseases].,"The intestinal microbiota exhibits a strong correlation with the function of the central nervous system, exerting influence on the host brain through neural pathways, immune pathways, and microbial metabolites along the gut-brain axis.

The identification of active compounds and therapeutic properties of fermented and non-fermented red sorghum for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia.,"Sorghum is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to its rich antioxidant and anti-inflammatory qualities. Fermentation may also affect nutritional values. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to discover the phenolic and flavonoid chemicals found in both fermented and non-fermented red sorghum, as well as their potential therapeutic uses for AD. L. fermentum, and L. reuteri, and/or L. plantarum and L. casei were used to ferment samples of sorghum. The rats were grouped into five groups, healthy animals, and rats with Alzheimer's receiving 200 mg/kg of saline, non-fermented sorghum, and fermented sorghum fermented with L. fermentum and L. reuteri, as well as L. plantarum and L. casei. Various assessments were conducted, including evaluations of behavioral responses, antioxidant responses, inflammatory responses, acetylcholine levels and acetylcholine esterase, and bacterial populations in stool. P-hydroxybenzoic acid, eriodictyo naringenin, and apigenin were significantly higher in fermented samples, while glycerols were higher in non-fermented samples. The induction of Alzheimer's led to decrease step-through latency, time in target zone, FRAP, acetylcholine levels, Bifidobacterium population and lactobacillus population, while increased escape latency, platform location latency, MDA levels, IL-6, TNF-α, acetylcholine esterase, and coliform population (P = 0.001). The administration of both non-fermented sorghum and fermented sorghum demonstrated the potential to reverse the effects of AD, with a notably higher efficacy observed in the fermented samples compared to the non-fermented ones. In conclusion, fermentation exerted significant effects on the bioactive compounds the administration of fermented sorghum resulted in improved behavioral responses, characterized by a reduction in oxidation, inflammation and microbial population.",2024,Alzheimer; Bacterial population; Behavioral responses; Fermentation; Phenolic compounds,"Sorghum; Alzheimer Disease; Fermentation; Animals; Male; Antioxidants; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Flavanones; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Disease Models, Animal; Flavonoids; Apigenin; Phenols; Acetylcholine; Acetylcholinesterase; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Lactobacillus; Plant Extracts; Feces","Akbari, M; Moardi, S; Piri, H; Amiri, R; Aliaqabozorg, F; Afraz, ES"
A new intestinal supplement 'Synbiotics' therapeutically regulates gut microbiota and activates PPARs pathway to inhibit Alzheimer's disease progression in mouse models.,"We aimed to investigate the role of Synbiotic preparations on the interaction of gut microbiota with AD development. APP/PS1 mice were randomized into APP/PS1 and Synbiotics groups, and C57BL/6J mice were used as wild type (WT) control group. The mice in the Synbiotics group and the APP/PS1 group were given Synbiotics and xylo-oligosaccharides for 3 months, respectively. The mice in the WT group were given the same amount of normal saline. Cognitive function was measured. Positron emission computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) was used to detect fasting blood glucose level. Immunohistochemical assay, ELISA, western blot and qRT-PCR were carried out to detect inflammatory factors. DNA extraction of fecal sample was performed to carry out sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis, metabolites sample preparation and Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (LC/MS) analysis were also performed. Synbiotics treatment can significantly ameliorate learning and memory competence by inhibiting Aβ protein deposition. Different bacteria in the intestine were significantly improved and changes in gut microbiota can affect the intestinal metabolism to affect multiple potential pathways after Synbiotics treatment. Synbiotics treatment can activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPARs) signaling pathway and significantly reduce neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice brains.

Effects of microbiome-based interventions on neurodegenerative diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by neuronal damage and progressive loss of neuron function. Microbiome-based interventions, such as dietary interventions, biotics, and fecal microbiome transplant, have been proposed as a novel approach to managing symptoms and modulating disease progression. Emerging clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of interventions modulating the GM in alleviating or reversing disease progression, yet no comprehensive synthesis have been done. A systematic review of the literature was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of microbiome-modulating methods. The search yielded 4051 articles, with 15 clinical trials included. The overall risk of bias was moderate in most studies. Most microbiome-modulating interventions changed the GM composition. Despite inconsistent changes in GM composition, the meta-analysis showed that microbiome-modulating interventions improved disease burden (SMD, - 0.57; 95% CI - 0.93 to - 0.21; I",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Gut microbiome; Microbiome modulating interventions; Multiple sclerosis; Neurodegenerative disease; Parkinson’s disease,Humans; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Microbiota; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Probiotics,"Chui, ZSW; Chan, LML; Zhang, EWH; Liang, S; Choi, EPH; Lok, KYW; Tun, HM; Kwok, JYY"
Correlation between APOE4 gene and gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease.,"Gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis has been increasingly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association between APOE4, the most common genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, and GM in AD remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the GM of participants from China and the USA, with and without APOE4 genes and with or without AD (67 AD cases, 67 control cases). Our results revealed that the GM alpha diversity was not different between groups (AD_APOE4, Control_APOE4, AD_non-APOE4, and Control_non-APOE4) (419.031 ± 143.631 vs 391.091 ± 126.081, 351.086 ± 169.174 and 386.089 ± 177.200, respectively.

Medication Use is Associated with Distinct Microbial Features in Anxiety and Depression.,"This study investigated the relationship between gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs), specifically anxiety disorder (ANXD) and/or major depressive disorder (MDD), as defined by DSM-IV or V criteria. The study also examined the influence of medication use, particularly antidepressants and/or anxiolytics, classified through the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System, on the gut microbiota. Both 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shallow shotgun sequencing were performed on DNA extracted from 666 fecal samples from the Tulsa-1000 and NeuroMAP CoBRE cohorts. The results highlight the significant influence of medication use; antidepressant use is associated with significant differences in gut microbiota beta diversity and has a larger effect size than NPD diagnosis. Next, specific microbes were associated with ANXD and MDD, highlighting their potential for non-pharmacological intervention. Finally, the study demonstrated the capability of Random Forest classifiers to predict diagnoses of NPD and medication use from microbial profiles, suggesting a promising direction for the use of gut microbiota as biomarkers for NPD. The findings suggest that future research on the gut microbiota's role in NPD and its interactions with pharmacological treatments are needed.",2024,,,"Dilmore, AH; Kuplicki, R; McDonald, D; Kumar, M; Estaki, M; Youngblut, N; Tyakht, A; Ackermann, G; Blach, C; MahmoudianDehkordi, S; Dunlop, BW; Bhattacharyya, S; Guinjoan, S; Mandaviya, P; Ley, RE; Kaddaruh-Dauok, R; Paulus, MP; Knight, R"
Microbial determinants of dementia risk in subjects of Mexican descent with type 2 diabetes living in South Texas.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common forerunner of neurodegeneration and dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved.

Gut instincts: Unveiling the connection between gut microbiota and Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by neuroinflammation and gradual cognitive decline. Recent research has revealed that the gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the mechanism by which GM and microbial metabolites alter brain function is not clearly understood. GM dysbiosis increases the permeability of the intestine, alters the blood-brain barrier permeability, and elevates proinflammatory mediators causing neurodegeneration. This review article introduced us to the composition and functions of GM along with its repercussions of dysbiosis in relation to AD. We also discussed the importance of the gut-brain axis and its role in communication. Later we focused on the mechanism behind gut dysbiosis and the progression of AD including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and changes in neurotransmitter levels. Furthermore, we highlighted recent developments in AD management, such as microbiota-based therapy, dietary interventions like prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.

From Microbes to Memories: Challenges and Future Perspectives Regarding the Gut-Brain Axis for Improved Cognitive Health in Alzheimer's.,"The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, regulates various physiological processes crucial for health, including immune response, metabolism, and neurotransmitter production. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), understanding the intricate connection of the gut-brain axis has gained significance. Disturbances along this axis have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing its role in AD pathogenesis. Microbiota dysbiosis, influenced by diet, lifestyle, and genetics, contributes to altered gut permeability, leading to protein dyshomeostasis, astroglial activation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing interventions to restore a healthy gut microbiota and potentially mitigate AD-related cognitive decline. The bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis involves microbial metabolites, influencing oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and other pathways linked to neuroprotection. Modulating the gut microbiota through dietary changes, prebiotics, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation emerges as a promising approach to target cognitive decline in AD. Despite progress, challenges persist, including the correlational nature of studies, the complexity of the gut microbiome, and variations in methodologies. Standardization is essential for reliable findings and the identification of biomarkers associated with AD. Unanswered questions warrant further exploration, particularly in understanding specific mechanisms, the temporal dynamics of microbiota changes, and the influence of diet and lifestyle on the gut-brain axis in AD. Future perspectives involve promising therapeutic interventions targeting the gut-brain axis, emphasizing personalized medicine to optimize outcomes based on individual variations in the gut-brain axis characteristics.",2024,alzheimer's disease; cognitive health; gut-brain axis; metabolites; microbiota dysbiosis; neuroinflammation,,"Franco, CD; Sagar, RS; Bokhari, SFH"
The interplay between microbiota and brain-gut axis in epilepsy treatment.,"The brain-gut axis plays a vital role in connecting the cognitive and emotional centers of the brain with the intricate workings of the intestines. An imbalance in the microbiota-mediated brain-gut axis extends far beyond conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and obesity, playing a critical role in the development and progression of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Epilepsy, a brain disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures, affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that rebuilding the gut microbiota through interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and ketogenic diets (KD) can benefit drug-resistant epilepsy. The disturbances in the gut microbiota could contribute to the toxic side effects of antiepileptic drugs and the development of drug resistance in epilepsy patients. These findings imply the potential impact of the gut microbiota on epilepsy and suggest that interventions targeting the microbiota, such as the KD, hold promise for managing and treating epilepsy. However, the full extent of the importance of microbiota in epilepsy treatment is not yet fully understood, and many aspects of this field remain unclear. Therefore, this article aims to provide an overview of the clinical and animal evidence supporting the regulatory role of gut microbiota in epilepsy, and of potential pathways within the brain-gut axis that may be influenced by the gut microbiota in epilepsy. Furthermore, we will discuss the recent advancements in epilepsy treatment, including the KD, fecal microbiota transplantation, and antiseizure drugs, all from the perspective of the gut microbiota.",2024,brain-gut-microbiota axis; endocrine pathway; epilepsy; immune pathway; viscerosensory pathway,,"Zhu, H; Wang, W; Li, Y"
The Role of Intestinal Microbiota and Diet as Modulating Factors in the Course of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.,"Many researchers propose manipulating microbiota to prevent and treat related diseases. The brain-gut axis is an object that remains the target of modern research, and it is not without reason that many researchers enrich it with microbiota and diet in its name. Numerous connections and mutual correlations have become the basis for seeking answers to many questions related to pathology as well as human physiology. Disorders of this homeostasis as well as dysbiosis itself accompany neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Heavily dependent on external factors, modulation of the gut microbiome represents an opportunity to advance the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Application of Dominant Gut Microbiota Promises to Replace Fecal Microbiota Transplantation as a New Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Several studies have confirmed that the pathophysiological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to changes in the intestinal microbiota; thus, modifying the intestinal microbiota has emerged as a new way to treat AD. Effective interventions for gut microbiota include the application of probiotics and other measures such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, the application of probiotics ignores that the intestine is a complete microecosystem with competition among microorganisms. FMT also has issues when applied to patient treatment. In a previous study, we found that eight species of bacteria that are isolated with high frequency in the normal intestinal microbiota (i.e., intestinal dominant microbiota) have biological activities consistent with the effects of FMT. In this article, we confirmed that the treatment of intestinal dominant microbiota significantly restored intestinal microbiota abundance and composition to normal levels in APP/PS1 mice; downregulated brain tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression levels; and reduced the area of Aβ plaque deposition in the brain hippocampus.

Gut microbiota modification by diosgenin mediates antiepileptic effects in a mouse model of epilepsy.,"Diosgenin, a natural steroid saponin, holds promise as a multitarget therapeutic for various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions. Its efficacy in slowing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke progression has been demonstrated. However, the role of diosgenin in anti-epilepsy and its potential connection to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota remain poorly understood. In this study, exogenous diosgenin significantly mitigated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, learning and memory deficits, and hippocampal neuronal injury. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing revealed a reversal in the decrease of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera in the PTZ-induced mouse epileptic model following diosgenin treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments illustrated the involvement of diosgenin in modulating gut microbiota and providing neuroprotection against epilepsy. Our results further indicated the repression of enteric glial cells (EGCs) activation and the TLR4-MyD88 pathway, coupled with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic lumen, and improved intestinal barrier function in epilepsy mice treated with diosgenin or FMT. This study suggests that diosgenin plays a role in modifying gut microbiota, contributing to the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, ultimately inhibiting epilepsy progression in a PTZ-induced mouse model.

A Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer's Disease: a serum and CSF-based metabolic analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a person's dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KD's metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.",2023,,,"Schweickart, A; Batra, R; Neth, BJ; Martino, C; Shenhav, L; Zhang, AR; Shi, P; Karu, N; Huynh, K; Meikle, PJ; Schimmel, L; Dilmore, AH; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Blach, C; Dorrestein, PC; Knight, R; Craft, S; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Krumsiek, J"

Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease: A Potential Role of Nose-Picking in Pathogen Entry via the Olfactory System?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment. Many possible factors might contribute to the development of AD, including amyloid peptide and tau deposition, but more recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may also play an-at least partial-role in its pathogenesis. In recent years, emerging research has explored the possible involvement of external, invading pathogens in starting or accelerating the neuroinflammatory processes in AD. In this narrative review, we advance the hypothesis that neuroinflammation in AD might be partially caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens entering the brain through the nose and the olfactory system. The olfactory system represents a plausible route for pathogen entry, given its direct anatomical connection to the brain and its involvement in the early stages of AD. We discuss the potential mechanisms through which pathogens may exploit the olfactory pathway to initiate neuroinflammation, one of them being accidental exposure of the olfactory mucosa to hands contaminated with soil and feces when picking one's nose.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; bacteria; brain; fungi; hand hygiene; neurodegeneration; neuroinflammation; nose-picking; olfaction; viruses,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Brain; Amyloidogenic Proteins,"Zhou, X; Kumar, P; Bhuyan, DJ; Jensen, SO; Roberts, TL; Münch, GW"

Probiotic Clostridium butyricum ameliorates cognitive impairment in obesity via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Obesity is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The gut microbiota-brain axis is altered in obesity and linked to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we targeted obesity-induced cognitive impairment by testing the impact of the probiotic Clostridium butyricum, which has previously shown beneficial effects on gut homeostasis and brain function. Firstly, we characterized and analyzed the gut microbial profiles of participants with obesity and the correlation between gut microbiota and cognitive scores. Then, using an obese mouse model induced by a Western-style diet (high-fat and fiber-deficient diet), the effects of Clostridium butyricum on the microbiota-gut-brain axis and hippocampal cognitive function were evaluated. Finally, fecal microbiota transplantation was performed to assess the functional link between Clostridium butyricum remodeling gut microbiota and hippocampal synaptic protein and cognitive behaviors. Our results showed that participants with obesity had gut microbiota dysbiosis characterized by an increase in phylum Proteobacteria and a decrease in Clostridium butyricum, which were closely associated with cognitive decline. In diet-induced obese mice, oral Clostridium butyricum supplementation significantly alleviated cognitive impairment, attenuated the deficit of hippocampal neurite outgrowth and synaptic ultrastructure, improved hippocampal transcriptome related to synapses and dendrites; a comparison of the effects of Clostridium butyricum in mice against human AD datasets revealed that many of the genes changes in AD were reversed by Clostridium butyricum; concurrently, Clostridium butyricum also prevented gut microbiota dysbiosis, colonic barrier impairment and inflammation, and attenuated endotoxemia. Importantly, fecal microbiota transplantation from donor-obese mice with Clostridium butyricum supplementation facilitated cognitive variables and colonic integrity compared with from donor obese mice, highlighting that Clostridium butyricum's impact on cognitive function is largely due to its ability to remodel gut microbiota.

Perturbations of the GBA have been reported in many neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others, suggesting a possible role in disease pathogenesis. The gut microbiota is a pivotal component of the GBA, and alterations in its composition, known as gut dysbiosis, have been associated with GBA dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota might influence the homeostasis of the CNS by modulating the immune system and, more directly, regulating the production of molecules and metabolites that influence the nervous and endocrine systems, making it a potential therapeutic target. Preclinical trials manipulating microbial composition through dietary intervention, probiotic and prebiotic supplementation, and fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) have provided promising outcomes. However, its clear mechanism is not well understood, and the results are not always consistent. Here, we provide an overview of the major components and communication pathways of the GBA, as well as therapeutic approaches targeting the GBA to ameliorate NDDs.",2023,gut dysbiosis; gut microbiota; gut–brain axis; neurodegenerative disorders; probiotics,Humans; Brain-Gut Axis; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Brain; Dysbiosis,"Zheng, Y; Bonfili, L; Wei, T; Eleuteri, AM"
Functional profiling of gut microbial and immune responses toward different types of dietary fiber: a step toward personalized dietary interventions.,"Dietary fiber plays a crucial role in maintaining gut and overall health. The objective of this study was to investigate whether different types of dietary fiber elicited specific changes in gut microbiota composition and the production of short-chain fatty acids. To test this, a longitudinal crossover study design was employed, in which healthy adult women consumed three distinct dietary fiber supplements: Inulin (fructo-oligosaccharide), Vitafiber (isomalto-oligosaccharide), and Fibremax (mixture of different fiber) during a one-week intervention period, followed by a 2-week washout period. A total of 15 g of soluble fiber was consumed daily for each supplement. Samples were collected before and after each intervention to analyze the composition of the gut microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing and fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids measured using nuclear magnetic resonance. Phenotypic changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were studied in subsets of participants with higher SCFA levels post-intervention using spectral flow cytometry. The results revealed substantial stability and resilience of the overall gut bacterial community toward fiber-induced changes. However, each supplement had specific effects on gut bacterial alpha and beta diversity, SCFA production, and immune changes. Inulin consistently exerted the most pronounced effect across individuals and certain taxa were identified as potential indicators of SCFA production in response to inulin supplementation. This distinguishing feature was not observed for the other fiber supplements. Further large-scale studies are required to confirm these findings. Overall, our study implies that personalized dietary fiber intervention could be tailored to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria to maximize SCFA production and associated health benefits.",2023,Dietary intervention; dietary fiber; fiber supplement; gut microbiome; immune profiling; inulin; personalized nutrition; short-chain fatty acid,"Adult; Female; Humans; Bacteria; Cross-Over Studies; Dietary Fiber; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Immunity; Inulin; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Oligosaccharides; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Longitudinal Studies","Tan, J; Ribeiro, RV; Barker, C; Daien, C; De Abreu Silveira, E; Holmes, A; Nanan, R; Simpson, SJ; Macia, L"
Gut microbiome-targeted therapies for Alzheimer's disease.,"The advent of high-throughput 'omics' technologies has improved our knowledge of gut microbiome in human health and disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder. Frequent bidirectional communications and mutual regulation exist between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis. A large body of research has reported a close association between the gut microbiota and AD development, and restoring a healthy gut microbiota may curb or even improve AD symptoms and progression. Thus, modulation of the gut microbiota has become a novel paradigm for clinical management of AD, and emerging effort has focused on developing potential novel strategies for preventing and/or treating the disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the connection and causal relationship between gut dysbiosis and AD, the mechanisms of gut microbiota in driving AD progression, and the successes and challenges of implementing available gut microbiome-targeted therapies (including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation) in preventive and/or therapeutic preclinical and clinical intervention studies of AD.

Gut Microbiota Composition in Patients with Neurodegenerative Disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's) and Healthy Controls: A Systematic Review.,"This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current literature regarding gut microbiota composition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to healthy controls. To identify the relevant studies, a thorough search of PubMed, Medline, and Embase was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Out of 5627 articles, 73 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility, which led to the inclusion of 42 studies (26 PD and 16 AD studies). The risk of bias assessment showed a medium risk in 32 studies (20 PD studies and 12 AD studies), a low risk in 9 studies (5 PD studies and 4 AD studies), and 1 PD study with a high risk. Among the PD studies, 22 out of 26 studies reported a different gut microbiota composition between the PD cases and the healthy controls, and 15 out of 16 AD studies reported differences in gut microbiota composition between the AD cases and the healthy controls. The PD and AD studies consistently identified the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria as prevalent in the gut microbiota in both the healthy groups and the case groups.

"Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Quantitative Electroencephalography Assessment of ACD856, a Novel Positive Allosteric Modulator of Trk-Receptors Following Multiple Doses in Healthy Subjects.","ACD856 is a positive allosteric modulator of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) receptors which has shown to have pro-cognitive and anti-depressant-like effects in various animal models. It is currently in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders where cognition is impaired and is also considered for indications such as depression or other neuropsychiatric diseases. ACD856 has a novel mechanism of action modulating the activity of the Trk-receptors, resulting in increased stimulation of the neurotrophin signaling pathways.

Review of microbiota gut brain axis and innate immunity in inflammatory and infective diseases.,"The microbiota gut brain (MGB) axis has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of inflammatory and infective diseases. Exploring the structure and communication mode of MGB axis is crucial for understanding its role in diseases, and studying the signaling pathways and regulatory methods of MGB axis regulation in diseases is also of profound significance for future clinical research. This article reviews the composition, communication mechanism of MGB axis and its role in inflammatory and infective diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, psoriasis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In addition, our investigation delved into the regulatory functions of the inflammasome, IFN-I, NF-κB, and PARK7/DJ-1 innate immune signaling pathway in the context of inflammatory and infective diseases. Ultimately, we discussed the efficacy of various interventions, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics, in the management of inflammatory and infective diseases.

Microbiota from Alzheimer's patients induce deficits in cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder leading to a decline in cognitive function and mental health. Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms. To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; adult hippocampal neurogenesis; faecal microbiota transplantation; memory,Humans; Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Hippocampus; Cognition; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Neurogenesis,"Grabrucker, S; Marizzoni, M; Silajdžić, E; Lopizzo, N; Mombelli, E; Nicolas, S; Dohm-Hansen, S; Scassellati, C; Moretti, DV; Rosa, M; Hoffmann, K; Cryan, JF; O'Leary, OF; English, JA; Lavelle, A; O'Neill, C; Thuret, S; Cattaneo, A; Nolan, YM"
The gut microbiome: an important role in neurodegenerative diseases and their therapeutic advances.,"There are complex interactions between the gut and the brain. With increasing research on the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function, accumulated clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that gut microbiota is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Increasingly studies are beginning to focus on the association between gut microbiota and central nervous system (CNS) degenerative pathologies to find potential therapies for these refractory diseases. In this review, we summarize the changes in the gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and contribute to our understanding of the function of the gut microbiota in NDs and its possible involvement in the pathogenesis. We subsequently discuss therapeutic approaches targeting gut microbial abnormalities in these diseases, including antibiotics, diet, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Furthermore, we summarize some completed and ongoing clinical trials of interventions with gut microbes for NDs, which may provide new ideas for studying NDs.",2023,Central neuroinflammation; Gut microbiota; Microbiota-gut-brain axis; Neurodegenerative diseases; Treatment,,"Li, S; Zhao, L; Xiao, J; Guo, Y; Fu, R; Zhang, Y; Xu, S"
Influence of complement protein C1q or complement receptor C5aR1 on gut microbiota composition in wildtype and Alzheimer's mouse models.,"The contribution of the gut microbiome to neuroinflammation, cognition, and Alzheimer's disease progression has been highlighted over the past few years. Additionally, inhibition of various components of the complement system has repeatedly been demonstrated to reduce neuroinflammation and improve cognitive performance in AD mouse models. Whether the deletion of these complement components is associated with distinct microbiome composition, which could impact neuroinflammation and cognitive performance in mouse models has not yet been examined. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of conditional and constitutive knockouts, pharmacological inhibitors, and various housing paradigms for the animal models and wild-type controls at various ages. We aimed to determine the impact of C1q or C5aR1 inhibition on the microbiome in the Arctic and Tg2576 mouse models of AD, which develop amyloid plaques at different ages and locations. Analysis of fecal samples from WT and Arctic mice following global deletion of C1q demonstrated significant alterations to the microbiomes of Arctic but not WT mice, with substantial differences in abundances of Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales and Alistipes. While no differences in microbiome diversity were detected between cohoused wildtype and Arctic mice with or without the constitutive deletion of the downstream complement receptor, C5aR1, a difference was detected between the C5aR1 sufficient (WT and Arctic) and deficient (C5ar1KO and ArcticC5aR1KO) mice, when the mice were housed segregated by C5aR1 genotype. However, cohousing of C5aR1 sufficient and deficient wildtype and Arctic mice resulted in a convergence of the microbiomes and equalized abundances of each identified order and genus across all genotypes. Similarly, pharmacologic treatment with the C5aR1 antagonist, PMX205, beginning at the onset of beta-amyloid plaque deposition in the Arctic and Tg2576 mice, demonstrated no impact of C5aR1 inhibition on the microbiome. This study demonstrates the importance of C1q in microbiota homeostasis in neurodegenerative disease. In addition, while demonstrating that constitutive deletion of C5aR1 can significantly alter the composition of the fecal microbiome, these differences are not present when C5aR1-deficient mice are cohoused with C5aR1-sufficient animals with or without the AD phenotype and suggests limited if any contribution of the microbiome to the previously observed prevention of cognitive and neuronal loss in the C5aR1-deficient AD models.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; C1q; C5aR1; Complement; Microbiome; Neuroprotection,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Complement C1q; Disease Models, Animal; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Receptors, Complement","Petrisko, TJ; Gargus, M; Chu, SH; Selvan, P; Whiteson, KL; Tenner, AJ"
An updated overview on the relationship between human gut microbiome dysbiosis and psychiatric and psychological disorders.,"There is a lot of evidence establishing that nervous system development is related to the composition and functions of the gut microbiome. In addition, the central nervous system (CNS) controls the imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, constituting a bidirectional communication system. At present, various gut-brain crosstalk routes have been described, including immune, endocrine and neural circuits via the vagal pathway. Several empirical data have associated gut microbiota alterations (dysbiosis) with neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism and Parkinson's disease, and with other psychological disorders, like anxiety and depression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapy has shown that the gut microbiota can transfer behavioral features to recipient animals, which provides strong evidence to establish a causal-effect relationship. Interventions, based on prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics, have demonstrated an important influence of microbiota on neurological disorders by the synthesis of neuroactive compounds that interact with the nervous system and by the regulation of inflammatory and endocrine processes. Further research is needed to demonstrate the influence of gut microbiota dysbiosis on psychiatric and psychological disorders, and how microbiota-based interventions may be used as potential therapeutic tools.",2024,Dysbiosis; Gut microbiota; Gut microbiota-CNS axis; Human microbiome; Neuropsychiatric diseases; Psychological disorders,,"Borrego-Ruiz, A; Borrego, JJ"
Bacteroides Fragilis in the gut microbiomes of Alzheimer's disease activates microglia and triggers pathogenesis in neuronal C/EBPβ transgenic mice.,"Gut dysbiosis contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and Bacteroides strains are selectively elevated in AD gut microbiota. However, it remains unknown which Bacteroides species and how their metabolites trigger AD pathologies. Here we show that Bacteroides fragilis and their metabolites 12-hydroxy-heptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHTrE) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) activate microglia and induce AD pathogenesis in neuronal C/EBPβ transgenic mice. Recolonization of antibiotics cocktail-pretreated Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice with AD patient fecal samples elicits AD pathologies, associated with C/EBPβ/Asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) pathway upregulation, microglia activation, and cognitive disorders compared to mice receiving healthy donors' fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Microbial 16S rRNA sequencing analysis shows higher abundance of proinflammatory Bacteroides fragilis in AD-FMT mice. Active components characterization from the sera and brains of the transplanted mice revealed that both 12-HHTrE and PGE2 activate primary microglia, fitting with poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites enrichment identified by metabolomics. Strikingly, recolonization with live but not dead Bacteroides fragilis elicited AD pathologies in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice, so did 12-HHTrE or PGE2 treatment alone. Collectively, our findings support a causal role for Bacteroides fragilis and the PUFA metabolites in activating microglia and inducing AD pathologies in Thy1- C/EBPβ transgenic mice.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Bacteroides fragilis; Mice, Transgenic; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Alzheimer Disease; Dinoprostone; Microglia; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Bacteroides; Bacterial Infections; Hydroxy Acids","Xia, Y; Xiao, Y; Wang, ZH; Liu, X; Alam, AM; Haran, JP; McCormick, BA; Shu, X; Wang, X; Ye, K"

Isoniazid derivatization strategy of carboxyl-containing metabolites for LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics.,"Metabolomics is a biochemical analysis tool for identifying metabolic phenotypes and used to reveal the pathogenic mechanisms of disease and to inform drug-targeted therapies. Carboxyl-containing metabolites (CCMs) account for an important proportion of the metabolome, but because of the diversity of physical and chemical properties of CCMs in biological samples, traditional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) targeted metabolome analysis methods cannot achieve simultaneous quantification of multiple types of CCMs. Therefore, we proposed for the first time a targeted metabolomics strategy using isoniazid derivatization combined with LC-MS/MS to simultaneously quantify 39 CCMs of 5 different types (short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, bile acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolic pathway acids) with large polarity differences associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and significantly improve the detection coverage and sensitivity. The yields of isoniazid derivative CCMs were high and could guarantee the accuracy of CCM quantification. The LODs of CCMs increased significantly (1.25-2000-fold) after derivatization. The method showed good selectivity, intra-day and inter-day accuracies and precisions, and repeatability. There was no significant effect on the determination of CCMs in terms of matrix effect and recovery. CCMs showed good stability. And CCMs showed good stability under short-term storage and freeze-thaw cycles. At the same time, the regulatory effects of Schisandrae chinensis Fructus and Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma (SG) herb pair on CCM metabolic disorders in feces, urine, serum, and the brain of AD rats were elucidated from the perspective of targeted metabolomics. In combination with pharmacodynamic evaluation and gut microbiota analysis, the mechanism of SG herb pair on AD rats was comprehensively understood. In summary, this innovative isoniazid derivatization combined with a targeted metabolomics method has great potential for trace biological lineage analysis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Carboxyl-containing metabolites; Isoniazid derivatization; Targeted metabolomics,,"Wang, A; Fan, Y; Fu, J; Song, F; Liu, Z; Liu, S"

Transmission of Alzheimer's disease-associated microbiota dysbiosis and its impact on cognitive function: evidence from mice and patients.,"Spouses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are at a higher risk of developing incidental dementia. However, the causes and underlying mechanism of this clinical observation remain largely unknown. One possible explanation is linked to microbiota dysbiosis, a condition that has been associated with AD. However, it remains unclear whether gut microbiota dysbiosis can be transmitted from AD individuals to non-AD individuals and contribute to the development of AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. We, therefore, set out to perform both animal studies and clinical investigation by co-housing wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice, analyzing microbiota via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, measuring short-chain fatty acid amounts, and employing behavioral test, mass spectrometry, site-mutations and other methods. The present study revealed that co-housing between wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice or administrating feces of AD transgenic mice to wild-type mice resulted in AD-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment in the wild-type mice. Gavage with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium restored these changes in the wild-type mice. The oral and gut microbiota of AD patient partners resembled that of AD patients but differed from healthy controls, indicating the transmission of microbiota. The underlying mechanism of these findings includes that the butyric acid-mediated acetylation of GSK3β at lysine 15 regulated its phosphorylation at serine 9, consequently impacting Tau phosphorylation. Pending confirmative studies, these results provide insight into a potential link between the transmission of AD-associated microbiota dysbiosis and development of cognitive impairment, which underscore the need for further research in this area.",2023,,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Dysbiosis; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Cognition; Mice, Transgenic; Cognitive Dysfunction; Gastrointestinal Microbiome","Zhang, Y; Shen, Y; Liufu, N; Liu, L; Li, W; Shi, Z; Zheng, H; Mei, X; Chen, CY; Jiang, Z; Abtahi, S; Dong, Y; Liang, F; Shi, Y; Cheng, LL; Yang, G; Kang, JX; Wilkinson, JE; Xie, Z"
Cerebral small vessel disease burden is associated with decreased abundance of gut Barnesiella intestinihominis bacterium in the Framingham Heart Study.,"A bidirectional communication exists between the brain and the gut, in which the gut microbiota influences cognitive function and vice-versa. Gut dysbiosis has been linked to several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, the relationship between gut dysbiosis and markers of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), a major contributor to ADRD, is unknown. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the connection between the gut microbiome, cognitive, and neuroimaging markers of cSVD in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Markers of cSVD included white matter hyperintensities (WMH), peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), and executive function (EF), estimated as the difference between the trail-making tests B and A. We included 972 FHS participants with MRI scans, neurocognitive measures, and stool samples and quantified the gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. We used multivariable association and differential abundance analyses adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and education level to estimate the association between gut microbiota and WMH, PSMD, and EF measures. Our results suggest an increased abundance of Pseudobutyrivibrio and Ruminococcus genera was associated with lower WMH and PSMD (p values < 0.001), as well as better executive function (p values < 0.01). In addition, in both differential and multivariable analyses, we found that the gram-negative bacterium Barnesiella intestinihominis was strongly associated with markers indicating a higher cSVD burden. Finally, functional analyses using PICRUSt implicated various KEGG pathways, including microbial quorum sensing, AMP/GMP-activated protein kinase, phenylpyruvate, and β-hydroxybutyrate production previously associated with cognitive performance and dementia. Our study provides important insights into the association between the gut microbiome and cSVD, but further studies are needed to replicate the findings.",2023,,"Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dysbiosis; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Bacteria; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases","Fongang, B; Satizabal, C; Kautz, TF; Wadop, YN; Muhammad, JAS; Vasquez, E; Mathews, J; Gireud-Goss, M; Saklad, AR; Himali, J; Beiser, A; Cavazos, JE; Mahaney, MC; Maestre, G; DeCarli, C; Shipp, EL; Vasan, RS; Seshadri, S"

Microbiome Alterations and Alzheimer's Disease: Modeling Strategies with Transgenic Mice.,"In the last decade, the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been gaining momentum in the context of many neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes, respectively. Notably, a balanced gut microbiota contributes to the epithelial intestinal barrier maintenance, modulates the host immune system, and releases neurotransmitters and/or neuroprotective short-chain fatty acids. However, dysbiosis may provoke immune dysregulation, impacting neuroinflammation through peripheral-central immune communication. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide or detrimental microbial end-products can cross the blood-brain barrier and induce or at least potentiate the neuropathological progression of AD. Thus, after repeated failure to find a cure for this dementia, a necessary paradigmatic shift towards considering AD as a systemic disorder has occurred. Here, we present an overview of the use of germ-free and/or transgenic animal models as valid tools to unravel the connection between dysbiosis, metabolic diseases, and AD, and to investigate novel therapeutical targets. Given the high impact of dietary habits, not only on the microbiota but also on other well-established AD risk factors such as diabetes or obesity, consistent changes of lifestyle along with microbiome-based therapies should be considered as complementary approaches.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; dysbiosis; fecal microbiota transplantation; metabolic diseases; microbiota; neuroinflammation; probiotics; tau; transgenic mouse models,,"López-Villodres, JA; Escamilla, A; Mercado-Sáenz, S; Alba-Tercedor, C; Rodriguez-Perez, LM; Arranz-Salas, I; Sanchez-Varo, R; Bermúdez, D"

Dual mode of Triphala in the reversal of cognition through gut restoration in antibiotic mediated prolonged dysbiosis condition in 5XFAD mice.,"The emerging role of gut-brain axis decoding recently created a new hope for investigating the biological and physiological basis of neurodegenerative disorders and other neurological problems. In this context, we used the bidirectional polyphenols-rich Triphala against the antibiotics cocktail-treated 5XFAD mice to decode the gut-brain axis. After 60 days of orally given Triphala and Antibiotics, the treated group showed significant improvement in the cognitive parameters in the behavioral study Morris water and Y maze. The Triphala treated group showed the neurogenesis, reduced level of amyloid beta in serum, and amyloid precursor protein, mRNA expression in the brain of mice. The serum level and mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity were also studied. Simultaneously, the Triphala-treated group showed improved gut transition time and increased butyrate levels in feces. The 16 s rRNA analysis of the V3-V4 region of feces DNA showed more presence of disease-modifying bacteria like Bacteriodetes and Verrucomicrobiota by the percentage of 31 and 23%.

Anaerobes in specific infectious and noninfectious diseases: new developments.,"With the buildup of new research data, newer associations between anaerobic bacteria and diseases/conditions were evaluated. The aim of the mini-review was to draw attention and to encourage further multidisciplinary studies of the associations. We considered microbiome-disease correlations such as a decrease of fecal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IBD recurrence, suggesting that F. prausnitzii could be a good biomarker for IBD. A link of subgingival Porphyromonas gingivalis with cardiovascular diseases was reported. Decreased Roseburia abundance was observed in the gut of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients. Akkermansia muciniphila was found to improve adipose/glucose metabolism, however, its intestinal abundance was observed in neurodegenerative diseases as well. Severe Clostridioides difficile infections have been reported in neonates and young children. Carcinogenic potential of anaerobes has been suggested. Fusobacterium nucleatum was implicated in the development of oral and colorectal cancer, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia were linked to esophageal cancer and Cutibacterium acnes subsp. defendens was associated with prostate cancer. However, there are some controversies about the results. In a Swedish longitudinal study, neither P. gingivalis nor T. forsythia exhibited oncogenic potential. The present data can enrich knowledge of anaerobic bacteria and their multifaceted significance for health and disease and can draw future research directions. However, more studies on large numbers of patients over prolonged periods are needed, taking into account the possible changes in the microbiota over time.",2023,Anaerobes; C. difficile; Cancer; Inflammatory bowel disease; Neurodegenerative diseases; Obesity,"Male; Child; Infant, Newborn; Humans; Child, Preschool; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Longitudinal Studies; Noncommunicable Diseases; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Microbiota; Porphyromonas gingivalis","Boyanova, L; Markovska, R; Yordanov, D; Gergova, R; Hadzhiyski, P"

Effects of gut microbiota on neurodegenerative diseases.,"A progressive degradation of the brain's structure and function, which results in a reduction in cognitive and motor skills, characterizes neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). The morbidity linked to NDs is growing, which poses a severe threat to human being's mental and physical ability to live well. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is now known to have a crucial role in the emergence of NDs. The gut microbiota is a conduit for the GBA, a two-way communication system between the gut and the brain. The myriad microorganisms that make up the gut microbiota can affect brain physiology by transmitting numerous microbial chemicals from the gut to the brain ",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Huntington’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; gut-brain axis; microbiota; neurodegenerative diseases,,"Khatoon, S; Kalam, N; Rashid, S; Bano, G"
Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Diseases and the Gut-Brain Axis: The Potential of Therapeutic Targeting of the Microbiome.,"The human gut microbiome contains the largest number of bacteria in the body and has the potential to greatly influence metabolism, not only locally but also systemically. There is an established link between a healthy, balanced, and diverse microbiome and overall health. When the gut microbiome becomes unbalanced (dysbiosis) through dietary changes, medication use, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and ageing, this has a profound effect on our health and is linked to many diseases, including lifestyle diseases, metabolic diseases, inflammatory diseases, and neurological diseases. While this link in humans is largely an association of dysbiosis with disease, in animal models, a causative link can be demonstrated. The link between the gut and the brain is particularly important in maintaining brain health, with a strong association between dysbiosis in the gut and neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. This link suggests not only that the gut microbiota composition can be used to make an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases but also that modifying the gut microbiome to influence the microbiome-gut-brain axis might present a therapeutic target for diseases that have proved intractable, with the aim of altering the trajectory of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, among others. There is also a microbiome-gut-brain link to other potentially reversible neurological diseases, such as migraine, post-operative cognitive dysfunction, and long COVID, which might be considered models of therapy for neurodegenerative disease. The role of traditional methods in altering the microbiome, as well as newer, more novel treatments such as faecal microbiome transplants and photobiomodulation, are discussed.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; autism spectrum disorder; faecal microbiome transplants; microbiome; neurodegenerative disease; neurodevelopmental disease; photobiomodulation,Animals; Humans; Brain-Gut Axis; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Dysbiosis; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome; COVID-19; Microbiota; Brain,"Bicknell, B; Liebert, A; Borody, T; Herkes, G; McLachlan, C; Kiat, H"

Establishment of a consensus protocol to explore the brain pathobiome in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: Research outline and call for collaboration.,"Microbial infections of the brain can lead to dementia, and for many decades microbial infections have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, a causal role for infection in AD remains contentious, and the lack of standardized detection methodologies has led to inconsistent detection/identification of microbes in AD brains. There is a need for a consensus methodology; the Alzheimer's Pathobiome Initiative aims to perform comparative molecular analyses of microbes in post mortem brains versus cerebrospinal fluid, blood, olfactory neuroepithelium, oral/nasopharyngeal tissue, bronchoalveolar, urinary, and gut/stool samples. Diverse extraction methodologies, polymerase chain reaction and sequencing techniques, and bioinformatic tools will be evaluated, in addition to direct microbial culture and metabolomic techniques. The goal is to provide a roadmap for detecting infectious agents in patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD.

Emerging role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a chronic age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by neuroinflammation and extracellular aggregation of Aβ peptide. Alzheimer's affects every 1 in 14 individuals aged 65 years and above. Recent studies suggest that the intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating neuro-inflammation which in turn influences Aβ deposition. The gut and the brain interact with each other through the nervous system and chemical means via the blood-brain barrier, which is termed the Microbiota Gut Brain Axis (MGBA). It is suggested that the gut microbiota can impact the host's health, and numerous factors, such as nutrition, pharmacological interventions, lifestyle, and geographic location, can alter the gut microbiota composition. Although, the exact relationship between gut dysbiosis and AD is still elusive, several mechanisms have been proposed as drivers of gut dysbiosis and their implications in AD pathology, which include, action of bacteria that produce bacterial amyloids and lipopolysaccharides causing macrophage dysfunction leading to increased gut permeability, hyperimmune activation of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and NLRP3), impairment of gut- blood brain barrier causing deposition of Aβ in the brain, etc. The study of micro-organisms associated with dysbiosis in AD with the aid of appropriate model organisms has recognized the phyla ",2023,Alzheimer's disease; blood brain barrier; gut brain microbiota axis; gut dysbiosis; gut microbiota; neuroinflammation; prebiotics,,"Solanki, R; Karande, A; Ranganathan, P"

Gut Microbiota is an Impact Factor based on the Brain-Gut Axis to Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of AD has been explained using cholinergic, β-amyloid toxicity, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and oxidative stress theories. However, an effective treatment method has not been developed. In recent years, with the discovery of the brain-gut axis (BGA) and breakthroughs made in Parkinson's disease, depression, autism, and other diseases, BGA has become a hotspot in AD research. Several studies have shown that gut microbiota can affect the brain and behavior of patients with AD, especially their cognitive function.

Plasmon-activated water as a therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's disease by altering gut microbiota.,"Gut microbiota (GM) are involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and might correlate to the machinery of the gut-brain axis. Alteration of the GM profiles becomes a potential therapy strategy in AD. Here, we found that plasmon-activated water (PAW) therapy altered GM profile and reduced AD symptoms in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice (AD mice). GM profile showed the difference between AD and WT mice. PAW therapy in AD mice altered GM profile and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) reproduced GM profile in AD mice. PAW therapy and FMT in AD mice reduced cognitive decline and amyloid accumulation by novel object recognition (NOR) test and amyloid PET imaging. Immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis of β-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated (p)-tau in the brain of AD mice were reduced in PAW therapy and FMT. The inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and pro-inflammatory indicator of arginase-1/CD86 ratio were also reduced. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of occludin and claudin-5 in the intestine and AXL in the brain were increased to correlate with the abundant GM in PAW therapy and FMT.

Transmission of Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Microbiota Dysbiosis and its Impact on Cognitive Function: Evidence from Mouse Models and Human Patients.,"Spouses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are at higher risk of developing AD dementia, but the reasons and underlying mechanism are unknown. One potential factor is gut microbiota dysbiosis, which has been associated with AD. However, it remains unclear whether the gut microbiota dysbiosis can be transmitted to non-AD individuals and contribute to the development of AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. The present study found that co-housing wild-type mice with AD transgenic mice or giving them AD transgenic mice feces caused AD-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment. Gavage with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium restored these changes. The oral and gut microbiota of AD patient partners resembled that of AD patients but differed from healthy controls, indicating the transmission of oral and gut microbiota and its impact on cognitive function. The underlying mechanism of these findings includes that the butyric acid-mediated acetylation of GSK3β at lysine 15 regulated its phosphorylation at serine 9, consequently impacting Tau phosphorylation.

Microbiota-gut-brain axis and related therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease: prospects for multitherapy and inflammation control.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the elderly and causes neurodegeneration, leading to memory loss, behavioral disorder, and psychiatric impairment. One potential mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of AD may be the imbalance in gut microbiota, local and systemic inflammation, and dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Most of the AD drugs approved for clinical use today are symptomatic treatments that do not improve AD pathologic changes. As a result, researchers are exploring novel therapeutic modalities. Treatments involving the MGBA include antibiotics, probiotics, transplantation of fecal microbiota, botanical products, and others. However, single-treatment modalities are not as effective as expected, and a combination therapy is gaining momentum. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in MGBA-related pathological mechanisms and treatment modalities in AD and to propose a new concept of combination therapy. ""MGBA-based multitherapy"" is an emerging view of treatment in which classic symptomatic treatments and MGBA-based therapeutic modalities are used in combination. Donepezil and memantine are two commonly used drugs in AD treatment. On the basis of the single/combined use of these two drugs, two/more additional drugs and treatment modalities that target the MGBA are chosen based on the characteristics of the patient's condition as an adjuvant treatment, as well as the maintenance of good lifestyle habits. ""MGBA-based multitherapy"" offers new insights for the treatment of cognitive impairment in AD patients and is expected to show good therapeutic results.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; combination therapy; gut microbiota; inflammatory factors; microbiota-gut-brain axis,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain-Gut Axis; Brain; Inflammation,"Li, J; Zhang, F; Zhao, L; Dong, C"

Assessment of the Relationship between Non-motor features and Severity of Parkinson's Disease Patients in Bangladesh.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease that may present with both motor and non-motor symptoms (NMSs). Many of the ignored NMSs may potentiate further deterioration of the patient's quality of life (QoL). But there is scarcity of data regarding NMSs of PD patients and their relationship with the disease severity in Bangladesh. This study was aimed to investigate the frequency of NMSs and assess their debatable impact on the severity of PD patients in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional type of observational study was conducted in neurology department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from January 2012 to June 2013 which recruited 60 eligible PD patients. The PD patients and disease severity was demonstrated by UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD and the Hoehn and Yahr scale respectively. Whereas, NMSs were demonstrated by the self-structured questionnaire which had encountered 30 common symptoms of PD. The mean age of our study cohort was found 57.88±10.56 years with male female ration 2:1. According to the Hoehn and Yahr (H & Y) severity scale 38.3%, 38.3%, 20.1% and 3.3% patients had been suffering from stage ?, stage II, stage III and stage ?V Parkinson's disease respectively. Irrespective of the severity of the PD the frequency of NMSs was nocturia (66.7%), sadness or blues (65.0%), memory disturbance (61.7%), anxiety (58.3%), insomnia (56.7%), orthostatic hypotension (55.0%), erectile dysfunction (50.0%), urinary urgency (46.7%), anhedonia (45.0%), olfactory disturbance (38.3%), constipation (38.3%), hyper or hypo sexuality (31.7%) and restless leg syndrome (31.7%). However, after head-to-head NMSs analysis, daytime dribbling of saliva (p=0.024), urinary urgency (p=0.036), nocturia (p=0.001), weight loss (p=0.001), anhedonia (p=0.027), excessive daytime sleepiness (p=0.024), insomnia (p=0.007), vivid dream (p=0.024), REM behavior disorder (p=0.010), restless leg syndrome/ periodic leg movements (p=0.043) had significantly been reported higher among the stage II PD patients than that of stage I patients. Whereas fall (p=0.001), dysphagia or choking (p=0.002), constipation (p=0.003), fecal incontinence (p=0.033), excessive daytime sleepiness (p=0.033), anxiety (p=0.036) and anhedonia (p=0.044) were significantly more prevalent among the advanced stage (III) than stage (II) PD patients.

Trust the gut: Outcomes of gut microbiota transplant in metabolic and cognitive disorders.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a main public health concern, with increasing prevalence and growingly premature onset in children, in spite of emerging and successful therapeutic options. T2DM promotes brain aging, and younger age at onset is associated with a higher risk of subsequent dementia. Preventive strategies should address predisposing conditions, like obesity and metabolic syndrome, and be started from very early and even prenatal life. Gut microbiota is an emerging target in obesity, diabetes and neurocognitive diseases, which could be safely modulated since pregnancy and infancy. Many correlative studies have supported its involvement in disease pathophysiology. Faecal material transplantation (FMT) studies have been conducted in clinical and preclinical settings to deliver cause-effect proof and mechanistic insights. This review provides a comprehensive overview of studies in which FMT was used to cure or cause obesity, metabolic syndrome, T2DM, cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, including the evidence available in early life.

The Gut-Prostate Axis: A New Perspective of Prostate Cancer Biology through the Gut Microbiome.,"Obesity and a high-fat diet are risk factors associated with prostate cancer, and lifestyle, especially diet, impacts the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome plays important roles in the development of several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and colon cancer. The analysis of feces from patients with prostate cancer by 16S rRNA sequencing has uncovered various associations between altered gut microbiomes and prostate cancer. Gut dysbiosis caused by the leakage of gut bacterial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids and lipopolysaccharide results in prostate cancer growth. Gut microbiota also play a role in the metabolism of androgen which could affect castration-resistant prostate cancer. Moreover, men with high-risk prostate cancer share a specific gut microbiome and treatments such as androgen-deprivation therapy alter the gut microbiome in a manner that favors prostate cancer growth. Thus, implementing interventions aiming to modify lifestyle or altering the gut microbiome with prebiotics or probiotics may curtail the development of prostate cancer. From this perspective, the ""Gut-Prostate Axis"" plays a fundamental bidirectional role in prostate cancer biology and should be considered when screening and treating prostate cancer patients.",2023,castration resistant prostate cancer; gut; microbiome; microbiota; prostate cancer,,"Fujita, K; Matsushita, M; De Velasco, MA; Hatano, K; Minami, T; Nonomura, N; Uemura, H"
The microbiome-gut-brain axis in epilepsy: pharmacotherapeutic target from bench evidence for potential bedside applications.,"The gut-brain axis augments the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain and modulates gut homeostasis and the central nervous system through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, enteroendocrine system, neuroendocrine system, inflammatory and immune pathways. Preclinical and clinical reports showed that gut dysbiosis might play a major regulatory role in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease that causes recurrent and unprovoked seizures, and numerous risk factors are implicated in developing epilepsy. Advanced consideration of the gut-microbiota-brain axis can reduce ambiguity about epilepsy pathology, antiepileptic drugs, and effective therapeutic targets. Gut microbiota sequencing analysis reported that the level of Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, and Firmicutes was increased and the level of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes was decreased in epilepsy patients. Clinical and preclinical studies also indicated that probiotics, ketogenic diet, faecal microbiota transplantation, and antibiotics can improve gut dysbiosis and alleviate seizure by enhancing the abundance of healthy biota.

Predicting Neurodegenerative Disease Using Prepathology Gut Microbiota Composition: a Longitudinal Study in Mice Modeling Alzheimer's Disease Pathologies.,"The gut microbiota-brain axis is suspected to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid-β plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. To evaluate the role of the gut microbiota-brain axis in AD, we characterized the gut microbiota of female 3xTg-AD mice modeling amyloidosis and tauopathy and wild-type (WT) genetic controls. Fecal samples were collected fortnightly from 4 to 52 weeks, and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. RNA was extracted from the colon and hippocampus, converted to cDNA, and used to measure immune gene expression using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Diversity metrics were calculated using QIIME2, and a random forest classifier was applied to predict bacterial features that are important in predicting mouse genotype. Gene expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; indicating astrocytosis) was elevated in the colon at 24 weeks. Markers of Th1 inflammation (il6) and microgliosis (mrc1) were elevated in the hippocampus.

Gut-brain axis through the lens of gut microbiota and their relationships with Alzheimer's disease pathology: Review and recommendations.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome (GM) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGB). Alterations in GM composition and diversity have been observed in both animal models and in human patients with AD. GM dysbiosis has been implicated in increased intestinal permeability, blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, neuroinflammation and the development of hallmarks of AD. Further elucidation of the role of GM in AD could pave way for the development of holistic predictive methods for determining AD risk and progression of disease. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that GM modulation could alleviate adverse symptoms of AD or serve as a preventive measure. In addition, increasing evidence shows that Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is often comorbid with AD, with common GM alterations and inflammatory response, which could chart the development of GM-related treatment interventions for both diseases. We conclude by exploring the therapeutic potential of GM in alleviating symptoms of AD and in reducing risk.

In-depth investigation of the mechanisms of Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide mitigating Alzheimer's disease rat via gut microbiota and feces metabolomics.,"Schisandra chinensis (S. chinensis) is an herbal medicine used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purified polysaccharide fraction, namely SCP2, was previously isolated from S. chinensis crude polysaccharide (SCP) and its structure and in vitro activity were investigated. However, the in vivo activity of SCP2 and its potential mechanism for the treatment of AD have yet to be determined. This study used a combination of microbiomics and metabolomics to comprehensively explore the microbiota and metabolic changes in AD rats under SCP2 intervention, with the aim of elucidating the potential mechanisms of SCP2 in the treatment of AD. SCP2 showed significant therapeutic effects in AD rats, as evidenced by improved learning and memory capacity, reduced neuroinflammation, and restoration of the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Fecal metabolomic and microbiomic analyses revealed that SCP2 significantly modulated 19 endogenous metabolites and reversed gut microbiota disorders in AD rats. Moreover, SCP2 significantly increased the content of short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) in the AD rats. Correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between gut microbes, metabolites and the content of SCFAs.

Gut-derived β-amyloid: Likely a centerpiece of the gut-brain axis contributing to Alzheimer's pathogenesis.,"Peripheral β-amyloid (Aβ), including those contained in the gut, may contribute to the formation of Aβ plaques in the brain, and gut microbiota appears to exert an impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) via the gut-brain axis, although detailed mechanisms are not clearly defined. The current study focused on uncovering the potential interactions among gut-derived Aβ in aging, gut microbiota, and AD pathogenesis. To achieve this goal, the expression levels of Aβ and several key proteins involved in Aβ metabolism were initially assessed in mouse gut, with key results confirmed in human tissue. The results demonstrated that a high level of Aβ was detected throughout the gut in both mice and human, and gut Aβ42 increased with age in wild type and mutant amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice. Next, the gut microbiome of mice was characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing, and we found the gut microbiome altered significantly in aged APP/PS1 mice and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of aged APP/PS1 mice increased gut BACE1 and Aβ42 levels. Intra-intestinal injection of isotope or fluorescence labeled Aβ combined with vagotomy was also performed to investigate the transmission of Aβ from gut to brain. The data showed that, in aged mice, the gut Aβ42 was transported to the brain mainly via blood rather than the vagal nerve. Furthermore, FMT of APP/PS1 mice induced neuroinflammation, a phenotype that mimics early AD pathology. Taken together, this study suggests that the gut is likely a critical source of Aβ in the brain, and gut microbiota can further upregulate gut Aβ production, thereby potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aging; cognition; gut microbiota; gut–brain axis; β-amyloid,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Brain-Gut Axis; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Mice, Transgenic; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Disease Models, Animal","Jin, J; Xu, Z; Zhang, L; Zhang, C; Zhao, X; Mao, Y; Zhang, H; Liang, X; Wu, J; Yang, Y; Zhang, J"
The Role of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are highly prevalent but poorly understood, and with few treatment options despite decades of intense research, attention has recently shifted toward other mediators of neurological disease that may present future targets for therapeutic research.

Effects of molecular hydrogen intervention on the gut microbiome in methamphetamine abusers with mental disorder.,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent and highly addictive psychostimulant and one of the most widely used illicit drugs, the abuse of which has become a severe public health problem worldwide. A growing amount of evidence has indicated potential connections between gut microbiota and mental disorders induced by METH and associations with neural and metabolic pathways. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between fecal microbial alterations and neuropsychiatric diseases in METH addictions. Thus, mental disorders and gut microbial alterations were analyzed by self-rating depression (SDS) and anxiety (SAS) scales and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that increased SDS and SAS indices and decreased alpha diversity indicated more serious mental disorders and lower bacterial diversity in METH users than in the age-matched healthy control group.

Conjoint hepatobiliary-enterohepatic cycles for amyloid excretion and enhancing its drug-induced clearance: a systems biology approach to Alzheimer's disease.,"The liver is the major organ responsible for metabolism of amyloid-beta, the primary toxic misfolded protein responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study focuses on the crucial role of liver in AD. We have developed a framework that formulates and integrates two reciprocal transport processes of amyloid, via hepato-biliary and enterohepatic circulations (EHC). Our system analysis approach shows that activating the liver X-receptor (LXR) can reduce amyloid-beta formation by increasing expression of the genes: ATP-binding-cassette-transporter (ABCA1) and Stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD). Besides, activating the pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) can enhance the clearance of amyloid-beta by increasing the expression of the genes: ATP-Binding-Cassette-Superfamily-G-member-2 (ABCG2) and multidrug-resistance protein-1 (MDR1). We also identified receptor-like apical sodium-dependent bile-acid transporter (ASBT) of intestinal enterocyte, showing affinity towards amyloid-beta, suggesting amyloid-beta's possible reuptake from intestinal contents to the systemic circulation through this receptor. Further, we have performed protein-protein interaction to evaluate the binding affinity of amyloid-beta to these receptors. Moreover, we undertook molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation of some repurposed drugs (rifampicin, 24-hydroxycholesterols, resveratrol, cilostazol) which can target the aforesaid receptors to enhance amyloid-beta's fecal clearance, reduce amyloid-beta formation, and prevent the reuptake of amyloid-beta from intestinal feces. Additionally, network pharmacology and synergism analysis were utilized to validate our hypothesis and identify the drug combinations, respectively. Gene-ontology investigation, network pharmacology, and consolidated pathway analysis validate the alteration of the above-mentioned gene expression profiles. Furthermore, our neuropharmacological synergism study identifies the optimal combination of the repurposed drugs. Finally, our findings on candidate drugs are substantiated by clinical-trial outcomes.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Electroacupuncture modulates gut microbiota in mice: A potential target in postoperative cognitive dysfunction.,"The detailed mechanism of inflammation in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether electroacupuncture (EA) ameliorates POCD by modulating gut microbial dysbiosis. Compared to the control group, mice in the EA group were treated at the acupoints Zusanli (ST36), Quchi (L111), Baihui (GV20), and Dazhui (GV14) 1 week before appendectomy. Novel object recognition and the Morris water maze tests were used to assess learning and spatial reference memory deficits, whereas hippocampus samples and stool samples were collected for central inflammatory tests and 16S-rRNA sequencing of intestinal flora, respectively. In amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice, EA enhanced spatial memory and learning deficits. The fecal microbial community was altered in APP/PS1 mice in the absence of EA following surgery. Among them, Coprococcus and Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the EA groups than in the control groups; however, Actinobacteriota, Helicobacteraceae, and Escherichia/shigella constitute the minor bacterial colonization in the EA groups. Furthermore, we found a significant negative correlation between Firmicutes and escape latency (Pearson correlation coefficient - 0.551, p < 0.01) and positive correlation between Proteobacteria and escape latency (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.462, p < 0.05). Electron microscopy revealed signs of blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairments and immunofluorescence images showed glial cells activated in the hippocampus of APP/PS mice without EA, and serum diamine oxidase levels were increased in these mice; whereas EA treatment significantly relieved the above pathological changes. Our findings implied that EA decreases hippocampal inflammation of APP/PS1 by upregulating benificial  gut microbiota, reducing BBB and intestinal barrier dysfunction, thus alleviates postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This may provide a novel target in POCD management.",2023,blood-brain barrier; electroacupuncture; gut microbiota; postoperative cognitive dysfunction,Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Postoperative Cognitive Complications; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Electroacupuncture; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Hippocampus; Inflammation,"Zhu, B; Zhou, Y; Zhou, W; Chen, C; Wang, J; Xu, S; Wang, Q"
