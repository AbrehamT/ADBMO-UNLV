Examining Associations Between Smartphone Use and Clinical Severity in Frontotemporal Dementia: Proof-of-Concept Study.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a leading cause of dementia in individuals aged <65 years. Several challenges to conducting in-person evaluations in FTLD illustrate an urgent need to develop remote, accessible, and low-burden assessment techniques. Studies of unobtrusive monitoring of at-home computer use in older adults with mild cognitive impairment show that declining function is reflected in reduced computer use; however, associations with smartphone use are unknown.",2024,clinical trials; cognition; cognitive impairment; digital; mobile phone; monitoring; neurodegenerative; neuropsychology; remote; screening; technology,Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Frontotemporal Dementia; Smartphone; Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Proof of Concept Study; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Mobile Applications,"Paolillo, EW; Casaletto, KB; Clark, AL; Taylor, JC; Heuer, HW; Wise, AB; Dhanam, S; Sanderson-Cimino, M; Saloner, R; Kramer, JH; Kornak, J; Kremers, W; Forsberg, L; Appleby, B; Bayram, E; Bozoki, A; Brushaber, D; Darby, RR; Day, GS; Dickerson, BC; Domoto-Reilly, K; Elahi, F; Fields, JA; Ghoshal, N; Graff-Radford, N; G H Hall, M; Honig, LS; Huey, ED; Lapid, MI; Litvan, I; Mackenzie, IR; Masdeu, JC; Mendez, MF; Mester, C; Miyagawa, T; Naasan, G; Pascual, B; Pressman, P; Ramos, EM; Rankin, KP; Rexach, J; Rojas, JC; VandeVrede, L; Wong, B; Wszolek, ZK; Boeve, BF; Rosen, HJ; Boxer, AL; Staffaroni, AM"

Value-based motivational strategies combined with technology to encourage a lifestyle that helps to prevent dementia.,"Lifestyles aimed at reducing dementia risk typically combine physical and cognitive training, nutritional adaptations, and, potentially, an augmentation in social interactions. Interventions at the population level are essential but should be complemented by individual efforts. For efficacy, lasting changes to an individual's lifestyle are needed, necessitating robust motivation and volition. Acting in accordance with one's values is assumed to be rewarding, leading to improved motivation and volition, and produces stable behaviour-outcome relationships. To this end, future preventive endeavours might first evaluate an individual's extant lifestyle, preferences, and values, including considerations of age-related changes to ensure these values remain a motivational source. Digital technology can support lifestyle goals and be targeted to support an individual's values. A digital platform could implement situation-specific, sensing-based feedback to alert users to a target situation (eg, opportunity for exercise) coupled with (smartphone-based) feedback on the extent of accomplished behavioural change to support individually set goals and facilitate their adjustment depending on whether these goals are achieved. This use of the motivational impetus of values, coupled with interpersonal techniques, such as motivational interviewing and SMART goal setting, in combination with sensor technology and just-in-time adaptive interventions, is assumed to hold high potential for dementia prevention.",2024,,Humans; Dementia; Motivation; Life Style,"Klöppel, S; Brill, E; Frisoni, GB; Aarsland, D; Klusmann-Weißkopf, V"

Automatic offline-capable smartphone paper-based microfluidic device for efficient biomarker detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment. Efficient and rapid detection plays a crucial role in mitigating and managing AD progression. Deep learning-assisted smartphone-based microfluidic paper analysis devices (μPADs) offer the advantages of low cost, good sensitivity, and rapid detection, providing a strategic pathway to address large-scale disease screening in resource-limited areas. However, existing smartphone-based detection platforms usually rely on large devices or cloud servers for data transfer and processing. Additionally, the implementation of automated colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassay (c-ELISA) on μPADs can further facilitate the realization of smartphone μPADs platforms for efficient disease detection.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassay (c-ELISA); Deep learning; Microfluidic paper analysis devices (μPADs); Offline; Smartphone,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Smartphone; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Paper; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Peptide Fragments; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Deep Learning; Automation; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques,"Duan, S; Cai, T; Liu, F; Li, Y; Yuan, H; Yuan, W; Huang, K; Hoettges, K; Chen, M; Lim, EG; Zhao, C; Song, P"

PROCare4Life lessons learned.,"PeRsOnalised Integrated CARE Solution for Elderly (PROCare4Life) was an EU-funded project that ran from January 2020 until June 2023, whose focus was to further develop and integrate previous ICT solutions developed by several previous EU-funded projects into a unique modular system able to support the autonomy and empowerment and to increase the Quality of Life (QoL) of elderly people living with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or similar dementia, having also tested the system for elderly people living with comorbidities. This article focuses on the methodology and results used to identify the internal lessons learned. PROCare4Life was developed using a codesign approach involving more than 2,000 participants whose input has been listened to and transformed into valuable changes of the system and also into lessons learned included in this case study report. Since the beginning of the implementation of PROCare4Life, there has been a commitment to make invisible knowledge visible through open discussion and including our lessons learned in each of our deliverables. In the last six months of implementation, qualitative research has been implemented by the PROCare4Life consortium to identify and select our most relevant challenges and recommendations for future projects and initiatives. PROCare4Life was highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is acknowledged in the lessons learned. However, the consortium has focused on the recommendations that could be more valuable for ordinary implementation of future projects and initiatives developing eHealth tools for elderly citizens living with conditions that might affect their cognitive or mobility capacities.",2023,dementia; eHealth; Integrated Care; Lessons Learned; Digital technologies; People centred codesign; Parkinson’s; Alzheimer’s,,"Gangas, P; Judica, E; Marin, M; Bouça-Machado, R; Ferreira, JJ; Louro, C; Brach, M; Linnane, D; Ahmed, M; Bentlage, E; Semerci, YC; Proença, JP; Alfonso, J"
Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD. Our new smartphone test, TapTalk, combines analysis of hand and speech-like movements to detect AD risk. This study aims to [1] determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately predict preclinical AD [2], determine usability, reliability, and validity of TapTalk in cognitively asymptomatic older adults and [3], prospectively validate TapTalk in older adults who have cognitive symptoms against cognitive tests and clinical diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Dementia; Diadochokinesis; Digital biomarker; Finger-tapping; Kinematics; Multimodal; TAS Test; TapTalk,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Alty, J; Goldberg, LR; Roccati, E; Lawler, K; Bai, Q; Huang, G; Bindoff, AD; Li, R; Wang, X; St George, RJ; Rudd, K; Bartlett, L; Collins, JM; Aiyede, M; Fernando, N; Bhagwat, A; Giffard, J; Salmon, K; McDonald, S; King, AE; Vickers, JC"

A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"

Early detection of diseases causing dementia using digital navigation and gait measures: A systematic review of evidence.,"Wearable digital technologies capable of measuring everyday behaviors could improve the early detection of dementia-causing diseases. We conducted two systematic reviews following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to establish the evidence base for measuring navigation and gait, two everyday behaviors affected early in AD and non-AD disorders and not adequately measured in current practice. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies on asymptomatic and early-stage symptomatic individuals at risk of dementia, with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale used to assess bias and evaluate methodological quality. Of 316 navigation and 2086 gait records identified, 27 and 83, respectively, were included in the final sample. We highlight several measures that may identify at-risk individuals, whose quantifiability with different devices mitigates the risk of future technological obsolescence.

Palladium nanoballs coupled with smartphone-thermal reader for photothermal lateral flow immunoassay of Aβ 1-40.,"Amyloid beta 1-40 (Aβ 1-40) is one of the most abundant substances in the body with the capacity to form insoluble aggregates and is a universal biomarker for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Here, a palladium nanoball (PNB)-strip was developed and coupled with a smartphone-thermal reader as an ultrasensitive and cost-effective platform for Aβ 1-40 detection. In this study, PNB was synthesized and introduced into lateral flow strips as an alternative signal source to gold nanoparticles to improve sensitivity because the PNB has a better heat generation ability. Quantitative analysis was performed using a self-developed smartphone-thermal reader, which is portable and cost-effective.

Digital phenotyping: An equal opportunity approach to reducing disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"A rapidly aging world population is fueling a concomitant increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Scientific inquiry, however, has largely focused on White populations in Australia, the European Union, and North America. As such, there is an incomplete understanding of AD in other populations. In this perspective, we describe research efforts and challenges of cohort studies from three regions of the world: Central America, East Africa, and East Asia. These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

Severity Classification Using Dynamic Time Warping-Based Voice Biomarkers for Patients With COVID-19: Feasibility Cross-Sectional Study.,"In Japan, individuals with mild COVID-19 illness previously required to be monitored in designated areas and were hospitalized only if their condition worsened to moderate illness or worse. Daily monitoring using a pulse oximeter was a crucial indicator for hospitalization. However, a drastic increase in the number of patients resulted in a shortage of pulse oximeters for monitoring. Therefore, an alternative and cost-effective method for monitoring patients with mild illness was required.

Digital behavioural signatures reveal trans-diagnostic clusters of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients.,"The current neuropsychiatric nosological categories underlie pragmatic treatment choice, regulation and clinical research but does not encompass biological rationale. However, subgroups of patients suffering from schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease have more in common than the neuropsychiatric nature of their condition, such as the expression of social dysfunction. The PRISM project presents here initial quantitative biological insights allowing the first steps toward a novel trans-diagnostic classification of psychiatric and neurological symptomatology intended to reinvigorate drug discovery in this area. In this study, we applied spectral clustering on digital behavioural endpoints derived from passive smartphone monitoring data in a subgroup of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as age matched healthy controls, as part of the PRISM clinical study. This analysis provided an objective social functioning characterization with three differential clusters that transcended initial diagnostic classification and was shown to be linked to quantitative neurobiological parameters assessed. This emerging quantitative framework will both offer new ways to classify individuals in biologically homogenous clusters irrespective of their initial diagnosis, and also offer insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these clusters.",2024,Behaviour; Clustering analysis; Digital phenotyping; Neuro-imaging; Neurology; Psychiatry,Humans; Schizophrenia; Alzheimer Disease,"Kas, MJH; Jongs, N; Mennes, M; Penninx, BWJH; Arango, C; van der Wee, N; Winter-van Rossum, I; Ayuso-Mateos, JL; Bilderbeck, AC; l'Hostis, P; Beckmann, CF; Dawson, GR; Sommer, B; Marston, HM"

Vertical Graphene-Based Printed Electrochemical Biosensor for Simultaneous Detection of Four Alzheimer's Disease Blood Biomarkers.,"Early detection and timely intervention play a vital role in the effective management of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, the diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease based on a single blood biomarker is relatively low, and the combined use of multiple blood biomarkers can greatly improve diagnostic accuracy. Herein, we report a printed electrochemical biosensor based on vertical graphene (VG) modified with gold nanoparticles (VG@nanoAu) for the simultaneous detection of four Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers. The printed electrochemical electrode array was constructed by laser etching and inkjet printing. Then gold nanoparticles were modified onto the working electrode surface via electrodeposition to further improve the sensitivity of the sensor. In addition, the entire printed electrochemical sensing system incorporates an electrochemical micro-workstation and a smartphone. The customized electrochemical micro-workstation incorporates four electro-chemical control chips, enabling the sensor to simultaneously analyze four biomarkers. Consequently, the printed electrochemical sensing system exhibits excellent analytical performance due to the large surface area, biocompatibility, and good conductivity of VG@nanoAu. The detection limit of the sensing system for Aβ40, Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau181 was 0.072, 0.089, 0.071, and 0.051 pg/mL, respectively, which meets the detection requirements of Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers. The printed electrochemical sensing system also exhibits good specificity and stability. This work has great value and promising prospects for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using blood biomarkers.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; printed electrochemical biosensor; vertical graphene,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gold; Graphite; Metal Nanoparticles; Biomarkers,"Li, M; Zeng, Y; Huang, Z; Zhang, L; Liu, Y"
Racially fair pupillometry measurements for RGB smartphone cameras using the far red spectrum.,"Pupillometry is a measurement of pupil dilation commonly performed as part of neurological assessments. Prior work have demonstrated the potential for pupillometry in screening or diagnosing a number of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's Disease, Schizophrenia, and Traumatic Brain Injury. Unfortunately, the expense and inaccessibility of specialized pupilometers that image in the near infrared spectrum limit the measurement to high resource clinics or institutions. Ideally, this measurement could be available via ubiquitous devices like smartphones or tablets with integrated visible spectrum imaging systems. In the visible spectrum of RGB cameras, the melanin in the iris absorbs light such that it is difficult to distinguish the pupil aperature that appears black. In this paper, we propose a novel pupillometry technique to enable smartphone RGB cameras to effectively differentiate the pupil from the iris. The proposed system utilizes a 630 nm long-pass filter to image in the far red (630-700 nm) spectrum, where the melanin in the iris reflects light to appear brighter in constrast to the dark pupil. Using a convolutional neural network, the proposed system measures pupil diameter as it dynamically changes in a frame by frame video. Comparing across 4 different smartphone models, the pupil-iris contrast of N = 12 participants increases by an average of 451% with the proposed system. In a validation study of N = 11 participants comparing the relative pupil change in the proposed system to a Neuroptics PLR-3000 Pupillometer during a pupillary light response test, the prototype system acheived a mean absolute error of 2.4%.",2023,,Humans; Melanins; Smartphone; Iris; Pupil; Alzheimer Disease; Iris Plant,"Barry, C; Wang, E"
Multilingual markers of depression in remotely collected speech samples: A preliminary analysis.,"Speech contains neuromuscular, physiological and cognitive components, and so is a potential biomarker of mental disorders. Previous studies indicate that speaking rate and pausing are associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, results are inconclusive as many studies are small and underpowered and do not include clinical samples. These studies have also been unilingual and use speech collected in controlled settings. If speech markers are to help understand the onset and progress of MDD, we need to uncover markers that are robust to language and establish the strength of associations in real-world data.",2023,Digital phenotypes; In-the-wild; Major depressive disorder; Speaking rate; Speech,"Humans; Speech; Depressive Disorder, Major; Depression; Language; Individuality","Cummins, N; Dineley, J; Conde, P; Matcham, F; Siddi, S; Lamers, F; Carr, E; Lavelle, G; Leightley, D; White, KM; Oetzmann, C; Campbell, EL; Simblett, S; Bruce, S; Haro, JM; Penninx, BWJH; Ranjan, Y; Rashid, Z; Stewart, C; Folarin, AA; Bailón, R; Schuller, BW; Wykes, T; Vairavan, S; Dobson, RJB; Narayan, VA; Hotopf, M"
Challenges in Using mHealth Data From Smartphones and Wearable Devices to Predict Depression Symptom Severity: Retrospective Analysis.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects millions of people worldwide, but timely treatment is not often received owing in part to inaccurate subjective recall and variability in the symptom course. Objective and frequent MDD monitoring can improve subjective recall and help to guide treatment selection. Attempts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to explore the relationship between the measures of depression and passive digital phenotypes (features) extracted from smartphones and wearables devices to remotely and continuously monitor changes in symptomatology. However, a number of challenges exist for the analysis of these data. These include maintaining participant engagement over extended time periods and therefore understanding what constitutes an acceptable threshold of missing data; distinguishing between the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships for different features to determine their utility in tracking within-individual longitudinal variation or screening individuals at high risk; and understanding the heterogeneity with which depression manifests itself in behavioral patterns quantified by the passive features.",2023,behavioral patterns; depression; digital phenotypes; missing data; mobile health; mobile phone; smartphones; wearable devices,"Humans; Smartphone; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Retrospective Studies; Telemedicine; Wearable Electronic Devices","Sun, S; Folarin, AA; Zhang, Y; Cummins, N; Garcia-Dias, R; Stewart, C; Ranjan, Y; Rashid, Z; Conde, P; Laiou, P; Sankesara, H; Matcham, F; Leightley, D; White, KM; Oetzmann, C; Ivan, A; Lamers, F; Siddi, S; Simblett, S; Nica, R; Rintala, A; Mohr, DC; Myin-Germeys, I; Wykes, T; Haro, JM; Penninx, BWJH; Vairavan, S; Narayan, VA; Annas, P; Hotopf, M; Dobson, RJB"

A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk: Design and methodology of a randomized clinical trial.,"Aging populations are at increased risk of sleep deficiencies (e.g., insomnia) that are associated with a variety of chronic health risks, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Insomnia medications carry additional risk, including increased drowsiness and falls, as well as polypharmacy risks. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), but access is limited. Telehealth is one way to increase access, particularly for older adults, but to date telehealth has been typically limited to simple videoconferencing portals. While these portals have been shown to be non-inferior to in-person treatment, it is plausible that telehealth could be significantly improved. This work describes a protocol designed to evaluate whether a clinician-patient dashboard inclusive of several user-friendly features (e.g., patterns of sleep data from ambulatory devices, guided relaxation resources, and reminders to complete in-home CBTi practice) could improve CBTi outcomes for middle- to older-aged adults (N = 100). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three telehealth interventions delivered through 6-weekly sessions: (1) CBTi augmented with a clinician-patient dashboard, smartphone application, and integrated smart devices; (2) standard CBTi (i.e., active comparator); or (3) sleep hygiene education (i.e., active control). All participants were assessed at screening, pre-study evaluation, baseline, throughout treatment, and at 1-week post-treatment. The primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index.

[Mobile everyday-life digital technologies for the prevention of Alzheimer's dementia: cognitive health and cognitive safety].,"It is generally accepted that the treatment of Alzheimer's disease should be flanked by preventive measures for risk reduction in order to maintain cognitive functions for as long as possible; however, the research and development of treatment concepts are both faced with challenges. The preventive risk reduction necessitates a high level of coordination of neurology and psychiatry with other disciplines. Also, patients must develop a high level of health competence and summon up self-motivation and adherence. This concept article deals with the question of how mobile everyday-life digital technologies can help to address these challenges. The core prerequisite is the interdisciplinary coordinated structuring of prevention with the focus on cognitive health and cognitive safety. Cognitive health relates to a reduction of risk factors associated with lifestyle. Cognitive safety concerns the avoidance of iatrogenic side effects on cognitive functions. Digital technologies that are relevant in this context are mobile apps based on smartphones or tablets for everyday-life and high-frequency recording of cognitive functions, apps that can coach the implementation of lifestyle changes as companion technologies, apps that can assist in the reduction of iatrogenic risks and those that can improve the health competence of patients and relatives. The state of development of such medical products is at different stages of progress. Therefore, this concept article does not provide a review of existing products but rather deals with the fundamental interplay of potential solutions in the prevention of Alzheimer dementia in the areas of cognitive health and cognitive safety.",2023,Health competence; Interdisciplinary medicine; Preventive measures; Risk reduction; Treatment concepts,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Digital Technology; Cognition; Smartphone; Mobile Applications,"Düzel, E; Thyrian, JR"

Wearable device and smartphone data quantify ALS progression and may provide novel outcome measures.,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapeutic development has largely relied on staff-administered functional rating scales to determine treatment efficacy. We sought to determine if mobile applications (apps) and wearable devices can be used to quantify ALS disease progression through active (surveys) and passive (sensors) data collection. Forty ambulatory adults with ALS were followed for 6-months. The Beiwe app was used to administer the self-entry ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-RSE) and the Rasch Overall ALS Disability Scale (ROADS) surveys every 2-4 weeks. Each participant used a wrist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph Insight Watch) or an ankle-worn activity monitor (Modus StepWatch) continuously. Wearable device wear and app survey compliance were adequate. ALSFRS-R highly correlated with ALSFRS-RSE. Several wearable data daily physical activity measures demonstrated statistically significant change over time and associations with ALSFRS-RSE and ROADS. Active and passive digital data collection hold promise for novel ALS trial outcome measure development.,2023,,,"Johnson, SA; Karas, M; Burke, KM; Straczkiewicz, M; Scheier, ZA; Clark, AP; Iwasaki, S; Lahav, A; Iyer, AS; Onnela, JP; Berry, JD"
Long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in an app and wearable-based multinational remote digital depression study.,"Recent growth in digital technologies has enabled the recruitment and monitoring of large and diverse populations in remote health studies. However, the generalizability of inference drawn from remotely collected health data could be severely impacted by uneven participant engagement and attrition over the course of the study. We report findings on long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in a large multinational observational digital study for depression containing active (surveys) and passive sensor data collected via Android smartphones, and Fitbit devices from 614 participants for up to 2 years. Majority of participants (67.6%) continued to remain engaged in the study after 43 weeks. Unsupervised clustering of participants' study apps and Fitbit usage data showed 3 distinct engagement subgroups for each data stream. We found: (i) the least engaged group had the highest depression severity (4 PHQ8 points higher) across all data streams; (ii) the least engaged group (completed 4 bi-weekly surveys) took significantly longer to respond to survey notifications (3.8 h more) and were 5 years younger compared to the most engaged group (completed 20 bi-weekly surveys); and (iii) a considerable proportion (44.6%) of the participants who stopped completing surveys after 8 weeks continued to share passive Fitbit data for significantly longer (average 42 weeks).

To BYOD or not: Are device latencies important for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) smartphone cognitive testing?,"Studies using remote cognitive testing must make a critical decision: whether to allow participants to use their own devices or to provide participants with a study-specific device. Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) studies have several advantages including increased accessibility, potential for larger sample sizes, and reduced participant burden. However, BYOD studies offer little control over device performance characteristics that could potentially influence results. In particular, response times measured by each device not only include the participant's true response time, but also latencies of the device itself. The present study investigated two prominent sources of device latencies that pose significant risks to data quality: device display output latency and touchscreen input latency. We comprehensively tested 26 popular smartphones ranging in price from < $100 to $1000+ running either Android or iOS to determine if hardware and operating system differences led to appreciable device latency variability. To accomplish this, a custom-built device called the Latency and Timing Assessment Robot (LaTARbot) measured device display output and capacitive touchscreen input latencies. We found considerable variability across smartphones in display and touch latencies which, if unaccounted for, could be misattributed as individual or group differences in response times. Specifically, total device (sum of display and touch) latencies ranged from 35 to 140 ms. We offer recommendations to researchers to increase the precision of data collection and analysis in the context of remote BYOD studies.",2023,Ambulatory assessment; BYOD; Remote assessment; Smartphones,"Humans; Smartphone; Computers, Handheld; Data Collection; Software","Nicosia, J; Wang, B; Aschenbrenner, AJ; Sliwinski, MJ; Yabiku, ST; Roque, NA; Germine, LT; Bateman, RJ; Morris, JC; Hassenstab, J"
