Optimized efficient attention-based network for facial expressions analysis in neurological health care.,"Facial Expression Analysis (FEA) plays a vital role in diagnosing and treating early-stage neurological disorders (NDs) like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Manual FEA is hindered by expertise, time, and training requirements, while automatic methods confront difficulties with real patient data unavailability, high computations, and irrelevant feature extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach: an efficient, lightweight convolutional block attention module (CBAM) based deep learning network (DLN) to aid doctors in diagnosing ND patients. The method comprises two stages: data collection of real ND patients, and pre-processing, involving face detection and an attention-enhanced DLN for feature extraction and refinement. Extensive experiments with validation on real patient data showcase compelling performance, achieving an accuracy of up to 73.2%. Despite its efficacy, the proposed model is lightweight, occupying only 3MB, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained mobile healthcare devices. Moreover, the method exhibits significant advancements over existing FEA approaches, holding tremendous promise in effectively diagnosing and treating ND patients. By accurately recognizing emotions and extracting relevant features, this approach empowers medical professionals in early ND detection and management, overcoming the challenges of manual analysis and heavy models. In conclusion, this research presents a significant leap in FEA, promising to enhance ND diagnosis and care.The code and data used in this work are available at: https://github.com/munsif200/Neurological-Health-Care.",2024,Deep learning; Facial expression analysis; Information processing; Mobile health care; Neurological disorder; Parkinson,,"Munsif, M; Sajjad, M; Ullah, M; Tarekegn, AN; Cheikh, FA; Tsakanikas, P; Muhammad, K"

[Geriatric failure to thrive: between illusory diagnosis and clinical reality].,"The geriatric failure to thrive, a controversial French concept not present in the international literature, was first characterized by Jean Carrié in 1956. It is described as a process of aging and physical and psychological decline associated with advanced age, manifesting as a pronounced overall deterioration. In this case report, we present the case of an 88-year-old patient, admitted to a general medicine service for geriatric failure to thrive, whose management eventually leads to the diagnosis of endocarditis with digestive cancer complicated by a characterized depressive episode. This case prompts us to consider the geriatric failure to thrive with extreme caution and challenges the legitimacy of such a diagnosis in the context of an aging population and the progress of medical sciences.",2024,cancer; failure to thrive; frailty; older adults,,"Bretelle, F; Nicot, P; Arcani, R; Horowitz, T; Comon, M; Garrido, V; Daumas, A; Bonin-Guillaume, S"

Targeting the autophagy-NAD axis protects against cell death in Niemann-Pick type C1 disease models.,"Impairment of autophagy leads to an accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles and has been implicated in plethora of human diseases. Loss of autophagy in actively respiring cells has also been shown to trigger metabolic collapse mediated by the depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) pools, resulting in cell death. Here we found that the deficit in the autophagy-NAD axis underpins the loss of viability in cell models of a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder, Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease. Defective autophagic flux in NPC1 cells resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction due to impairment of mitophagy, leading to the depletion of both the reduced and oxidised forms of NAD as identified via metabolic profiling. Consequently, exhaustion of the NAD pools triggered mitochondrial depolarisation and apoptotic cell death. Our chemical screening identified two FDA-approved drugs, celecoxib and memantine, as autophagy activators which effectively restored autophagic flux, NAD levels, and cell viability of NPC1 cells. Of biomedical relevance, either pharmacological rescue of the autophagy deficiency or NAD precursor supplementation restored NAD levels and improved the viability of NPC1 patient fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons. Together, our findings identify the autophagy-NAD axis as a mechanism of cell death and a target for therapeutic interventions in NPC1 disease, with a potential relevance to other neurodegenerative disorders.",2024,,"Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C; Humans; Autophagy; NAD; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Fibroblasts; Mitochondria; Memantine; Neurons; Cell Death; Cell Survival; Mitophagy; Apoptosis","Kataura, T; Sedlackova, L; Sun, C; Kocak, G; Wilson, N; Banks, P; Hayat, F; Trushin, S; Trushina, E; Maddocks, ODK; Oblong, JE; Miwa, S; Imoto, M; Saiki, S; Erskine, D; Migaud, ME; Sarkar, S; Korolchuk, VI"

Development and validation of high-performance liquid chromatography method for the simultaneous quantification of rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate and asiaticoside co-loaded in niosomes: A Box-Behnken design approach.,"Rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate (RHT), a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, is considered as the first-line therapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Asiaticoside (AS), a pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin, is well known as cognitive enhancer due to its antioxidant effect. Based on the hypothesis of their synergistic therapeutic potential, RHT and AS were co-encapsulated in niosomal formulation. A simple, precise, and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed for simultaneous quantitative analysis. The chromatographic parameters were optimized by Box-Behnken experimental design. The separation was performed on a reversed-phase Phenomenex C18 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column at 30 °C under the UV detection of 210 nm. The optimized mobile phase consisted of a mixture of 20 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 2.6) and acetonitrile (72:28 % v/v) under the isocratic mode at the flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. The developed method was fully validated under the ICH guidelines and could be successfully applied for simultaneous quantitative analysis of RHT and AS in niosomal formulation.",2024,"Asiaticoside; Box-Behnken, niosomes; Liquid chromatography; Method validation; Rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate","Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Triterpenes; Liposomes; Reproducibility of Results; Rivastigmine; Linear Models; Limit of Detection","Hnin, HM; Tun, T; Jansook, P"

A Novel RP-UHPLC-MS/MS Approach for the Determination of Tryptophan Metabolites Derivatized with 2-Bromo-4'-Nitroacetophenone.,"Many biologically active metabolites of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan (Trp) are associated with different neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disorders. Precise and reliable methods for their determination are needed. Variability in their physicochemical properties makes the analytical process challenging. In this case, chemical modification of analyte derivatization could come into play. Here, we introduce a novel fast reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UHPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method for the determination of Trp and its ten metabolites in human plasma samples after derivatization with 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone (BNAP). The derivatization procedure was optimized in terms of incubation time, temperature, concentration, and volume of the derivatization reagent. Method development comprises a choice of a suitable stationary phase, mobile phase composition, and gradient elution optimization. The developed method was validated according to the ICH guidelines. Results of all validation parameters were within the acceptance criteria of the guideline, i.e., intra- and inter-day precision (expressed as relative standard deviation; RSD) were in the range of 0.5-8.2% and 2.3-7.4%, accuracy was in the range of 93.3-109.7% and 94.7-110.1%, limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.15-9.43 ng/mL, coefficients of determination (R2) were higher than 0.9906, and carryovers were, in all cases, less than 8.8%. The practicability of the method was evaluated using the blue applicability grade index (BAGI) with a score of 65. Finally, the developed method was used for the analysis of Alzheimer's disease and healthy control plasma to prove its applicability. Statistical analysis revealed significant changes in picolinic acid (PA), anthranilic acid (AA), 5 hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-OH IAA), and quinolinic acid (QA) concentration levels. This could serve as the basis for future studies that will be conducted with a large cohort of patients.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; derivatization; liquid chromatography; tryptophan metabolites,,"Jankech, T; Gerhardtova, I; Majerova, P; Piestansky, J; Fialova, L; Jampilek, J; Kovac, A"
Spatial navigation questionnaires as a supportive diagnostic tool in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Impaired spatial navigation is early marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined ability of self- and informant-reported navigation questionnaires to discriminate between clinically and biomarker-defined participants, and associations of questionnaires with navigation performance, regional brain atrophy, AD biomarkers, and biomarker status. 262 participants (cognitively normal, with subjective cognitive decline, amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI], and mild dementia) and their informants completed three navigation questionnaires. Navigation performance, magnetic resonance imaging volume/thickness of AD-related brain regions, and AD biomarkers were measured. Informant-reported questionnaires distinguished between cognitively normal and impaired participants, and amyloid-β positive and negative aMCI. Lower scores were associated with worse navigation performance, greater atrophy in AD-related brain regions, and amyloid-β status. Self-reported questionnaire scores did not distinguish between the groups and were weakly associated with navigation performance. Other associations were not significant. Informant-reported navigation questionnaires may be a screening tool for early AD reflecting atrophy of AD-related brain regions and AD pathology.",2024,Clinical neuroscience; Disease; Neuroscience,,"Laczó, M; Svatkova, R; Lerch, O; Martinkovic, L; Zuntychova, T; Nedelska, Z; Horakova, H; Vyhnalek, M; Hort, J; Laczó, J"

The relationship between object-based spatial ability and virtual navigation performance.,"Spatial navigation is a multi-faceted behaviour drawing on many different aspects of cognition. Visuospatial abilities, such as mental rotation and visuospatial working memory, in particular, may be key factors. A range of tests have been developed to assess visuospatial processing and memory, but how such tests relate to navigation ability remains unclear. This understanding is important to advance tests of navigation for disease monitoring in various disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) where spatial impairment is an early symptom. Here, we report the use of an established mobile gaming app, Sea Hero Quest (SHQ), as a measure of navigation ability in a sample of young, predominantly female university students (N = 78; 20; female = 74.3%; mean age = 20.33 years). We used three separate tests of navigation embedded in SHQ: wayfinding, path integration and spatial memory in a radial arm maze. In the same participants, we also collected measures of mental rotation (Mental Rotation Test), visuospatial processing (Design Organization Test) and visuospatial working memory (Digital Corsi). We found few strong correlations across our measures. Being good at wayfinding in a virtual navigation test does not mean an individual will also be good at path integration, have a superior memory in a radial arm maze, or rate themself as having a strong sense of direction. However, we observed that participants who were good in the wayfinding task of SHQ tended to perform well on the three visuospatial tasks examined here, and to also use a landmark strategy in the radial maze task. These findings help clarify the associations between different abilities involved in spatial navigation.",2024,,"Humans; Female; Spatial Navigation; Male; Young Adult; Adult; Memory, Short-Term; Spatial Memory; Maze Learning; Space Perception; Adolescent; Mobile Applications","Garg, T; Velasco, PF; Patai, EZ; Malcolm, CP; Kovalets, V; Bohbot, VD; Coutrot, A; Hegarty, M; Hornberger, M; Spiers, HJ"

Does the interplay between human endogenous retrovirus K and extracellular vesicles contribute to aging?,"The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including retroviral-like particles (RVLPs), in pathogenic processes is currently a subject of active investigation. Several studies have identified mechanistic links between the increased presence of EVs and the process of senescence. A recent study reveals that the reverse transcribed complementary DNA (cDNA) of a human endogenous retroviral sequence can activate the innate immune system and result in tissue damage and/or the spread of cellular senescence to distant tissues. Several studies have linked EVs to age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and have included isolation of EVs from individuals with these diseases. Loss of epigenetic regulation, immune activation, and environmental stimuli can all lead to the expression of endogenous retroviruses and the incorporation of their proteins and transcripts into EVs. In addition, EVs disseminating these endogenous retroviral components have now been shown to act in a paracrine manner in multiple human diseases. Further investigation of the connection between EVs containing endogenous retroviral protein products or nucleotides should be pursued in models of age-related diseases.",2023,HML-2; aging; human endogenous retrovirus; mobile DNA; repetitive elements; senescence; transposable elements,,"DeMarino, C; Nath, A; Zhuang, Z; Doucet-O'Hare, TT"

A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"
Efficient axonal transport of endolysosomes relies on the balanced ratio of microtubule tyrosination and detyrosination.,"In neurons, the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton forms the basis for long-distance protein transport from the cell body into and out of dendrites and axons. To maintain neuronal polarity, the axon initial segment (AIS) serves as a physical barrier, separating the axon from the somatodendritic compartment and acting as a filter for axonal cargo. Selective trafficking is further instructed by axonal enrichment of MT post-translational modifications, which affect MT dynamics and the activity of motor proteins. Here, we compared two knockout mouse lines lacking the respective enzymes for MT tyrosination and detyrosination, and found that both knockouts led to a shortening of the AIS. Neurons from both lines also showed an increased immobile fraction of endolysosomes present in the axon, whereas mobile organelles displayed shortened run distances in the retrograde direction. Overall, our results highlight the importance of maintaining the balance of tyrosinated and detyrosinated MTs for proper AIS length and axonal transport processes.",2024,Axon initial segment; Axonal trafficking; Microtubule post-translational modification; Tubulin-tyrosine ligase; Vasohibins,"Animals; Microtubules; Axonal Transport; Tyrosine; Lysosomes; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Axons; Endosomes; Neurons","Konietzny, A; Han, Y; Popp, Y; van Bommel, B; Sharma, A; Delagrange, P; Arbez, N; Moutin, MJ; Peris, L; Mikhaylova, M"
Alzheimer's disease progression detection based on optical fluence rate measurements using alternative laser wavelengths.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) levels have increased globally, which is considered the sixth reason for deaths. So, a requirement exists for economic and quantitative methods to follow up the gradual progression of AD. The current study presents a simulation for a non-irradiated, safe, wearable, and noninvasive mobile approach for detecting the progression of Alzheimer's brain atrophy using the optical diffusion technique and for investigating the difference between the normal and the diseased brain. The virtual study was accomplished using COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulated head is implemented as the following: scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and white matter. The optical properties of the heterogeneous tissue are observed using the fluence rate after irradiating the head with different wavelengths (630, 700, 810, 915, and 1000 nm) of lasers. Two assessment techniques were applied to evaluate the brain atrophy measurements; the first technique was an array of photodetectors, which were lined at the head posterior, while a matrix of photodetectors was applied over the head surface in the second technique. The results show that the surface photodetectors approach differentiates the normal from AD brains without measuring the brain atrophy percentages by applying 630 nm. The array of photodetectors distinguishes normal from AD brains without detecting the brain atrophy percentages when the wavelengths 630, 700, and 810 nm were applied. The line detector at 1000 nm evaluates the brain atrophy percentages with AD. The future explores applying those techniques in vivo and analyzing the information by the spectrometer for extensively safer early detection of neural disorders.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; diffuse optical imaging; optical fluence rate; optical properties,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Disease Progression; Lasers; Brain; Atrophy; Gray Matter,"Mahdy, S; Abuelmakarem, HS"

National plans and awareness campaigns as priorities for achieving global brain health.,"Neurological conditions are the leading cause of death and disability combined. This public health crisis has become a global priority with the introduction of WHO's Intersectoral Global Action Plan on Epilepsy and Other Neurological Disorders 2022-2031 (IGAP). 18 months after this plan was adopted, global neurology stakeholders, including representatives of the OneNeurology Partnership (a consortium uniting global neurology organisations), take stock and advocate for urgent acceleration of IGAP implementation. Drawing on lessons from relevant global health contexts, this Health Policy identifies two priority IGAP targets to expedite national delivery of the entire 10-year plan: namely, to update national policies and plans, and to create awareness campaigns and advocacy programmes for neurological conditions and brain health. To ensure rapid attainment of the identified priority targets, six strategic drivers are proposed: universal community awareness, integrated neurology approaches, intersectoral governance, regionally coordinated IGAP domestication, lived experience-informed policy making, and neurological mainstreaming (advocating to embed brain health into broader policy agendas). Contextualised with globally emerging IGAP-directed efforts and key considerations for intersectoral policy design, this novel framework provides actionable recommendations for policy makers and IGAP implementation partners. Timely, synergistic pursuit of the six drivers might aid WHO member states in cultivating public awareness and policy structures required for successful intersectoral roll-out of IGAP by 2031, paving the way towards brain health for all.",2024,,Humans; Global Health; Health Policy; Policy Making; Public Health; Brain,"Winter, SF; Walsh, D; Catsman-Berrevoets, C; Feigin, V; Destrebecq, F; Dickson, SL; Leonardi, M; Hoemberg, V; Tassorelli, C; Ferretti, MT; Dé, A; Chadha, AS; Lynch, C; Bakhtadze, S; Saylor, D; Hwang, S; Rostasy, K; Kluger, BM; Wright, C; Zee, PC; Dodick, DW; Jaarsma, J; Owolabi, MO; Zaletel, J; Albreht, T; Dhamija, RK; Helme, A; Laurson-Doube, J; Amos, A; Baingana, FK; Baker, GA; Sofia, F; Galvin, O; Hawrot, T"

Machine learning driven web-based app platform for the discovery of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.,"Monoamine oxidases (MAOs), specifically MAO-A and MAO-B, play important roles in the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters. Therefore, MAO inhibitors are crucial for treating various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this study, we developed a novel cheminformatics pipeline by generating three diverse molecular feature-based machine learning-assisted quantitative structural activity relationship (ML-QSAR) models concerning MAO-B inhibition. PubChem fingerprints, substructure fingerprints, and one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) molecular descriptors were implemented to unravel the structural insights responsible for decoding the origin of MAO-B inhibition in 249 non-reductant molecules. Based on a random forest ML algorithm, the final PubChem fingerprint, substructure fingerprint, and 1D and 2D molecular descriptor prediction models demonstrated significant robustness, with correlation coefficients of 0.9863, 0.9796, and 0.9852, respectively. The significant features of each predictive model responsible for MAO-B inhibition were extracted using a comprehensive variance importance plot (VIP) and correlation matrix analysis. The final predictive models were further developed as a web application, MAO-B-pred ( https://mao-b-pred.streamlit.app/ ), to allow users to predict the bioactivity of molecules against MAO-B. Molecular docking and dynamics studies were conducted to gain insight into the atomic-level molecular interactions between the ligand-receptor complexes. These findings were compared with the structural features obtained from the ML-QSAR models, which supported the mechanistic understanding of the binding phenomena. The presented models have the potential to serve as tools for identifying crucial molecular characteristics for the rational design of MAO-B target inhibitors, which may be used to develop effective drugs for neurodegenerative disorders.",2024,1D and 2D molecular descriptors; Bioactivity; ML-QSAR; Molecular docking; Molecular dynamics simulation; Molecular interactions; Monoamine oxidase B; Prediction models; PubChem fingerprints; Substructure fingerprints; Web application,Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Mobile Applications; Monoamine Oxidase; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Dopamine Agents; Internet; Structure-Activity Relationship,"Kumar, S; Bhowmik, R; Oh, JM; Abdelgawad, MA; Ghoneim, MM; Al-Serwi, RH; Kim, H; Mathew, B"

An Explainable AI Paradigm for Alzheimer's Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide, causing severe cognitive decline and memory impairment. The early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for effective intervention and disease management. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in medical image analysis, including AD diagnosis from neuroimaging data. However, the lack of interpretability in deep learning models hinders their adoption in clinical settings, where explainability is essential for gaining trust and acceptance from healthcare professionals. In this study, we propose an explainable AI (XAI)-based approach for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, leveraging the power of deep transfer learning and ensemble modeling. The proposed framework aims to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models by incorporating XAI techniques, allowing clinicians to understand the decision-making process and providing valuable insights into disease diagnosis. By leveraging popular pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate their individual performances on a comprehensive dataset. The proposed ensembles, Ensemble-1 (VGG16 and VGG19) and Ensemble-2 (DenseNet169 and DenseNet201), demonstrated superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores compared to individual models, reaching up to 95%. In order to enhance interpretability and transparency in Alzheimer's diagnosis, we introduced a novel model achieving an impressive accuracy of 96%. This model incorporates explainable AI techniques, including saliency maps and grad-CAM (gradient-weighted class activation mapping). The integration of these techniques not only contributes to the model's exceptional accuracy but also provides clinicians and researchers with visual insights into the neural regions influencing the diagnosis. Our findings showcase the potential of combining deep transfer learning with explainable AI in the realm of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, paving the way for more interpretable and clinically relevant AI models in healthcare.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; explainable AI (XAI); grad-CAM; saliency maps; transfer learning,,"Mahmud, T; Barua, K; Habiba, SU; Sharmen, N; Hossain, MS; Andersson, K"

Transposable Elements: Emerging Therapeutic Targets in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal function and structure. While several genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders, emerging evidence suggests that transposable elements (TEs), once considered ""junk DNA,"" play a significant role in their development and progression. TEs are mobile genetic elements capable of moving within the genome, and their dysregulation has been associated with genomic instability, altered gene expression, and neuroinflammation. This review provides an overview of TEs, including long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), mechanisms of repression and derepression, and their potential impact on neurodegeneration. The evidence linking TEs to AD, PD, and ALS by shedding light on the complex interactions between TEs and neurodegeneration has been discussed. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of targeting TEs in neurodegenerative diseases has been explored. Understanding the role of TEs in neurodegeneration holds promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating disease progression and preserving neuronal health.",2024,Junk DNA; Neurodegenerative diseases; Therapeutic target; Transposable elements,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; DNA Transposable Elements; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease,"Singh, S; Borkar, MR; Bhatt, LK"

"A framework for language technologies in behavioral research and clinical applications: Ethical challenges, implications, and solutions.","Technological advances in the assessment and understanding of speech and language within the domains of automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning present a remarkable opportunity for psychologists to learn more about human thought and communication, evaluate a variety of clinical conditions, and predict cognitive and psychological states. These innovations can be leveraged to automate traditionally time-intensive assessment tasks (e.g., educational assessment), provide psychological information and care (e.g., chatbots), and when delivered remotely (e.g., by mobile phone or wearable sensors) promise underserved communities greater access to health care. Indeed, the automatic analysis of speech provides a wealth of information that can be used for patient care in a wide range of settings (e.g., mHealth applications) and for diverse purposes (e.g., behavioral and clinical research, medical tools that are implemented into practice) and patient types (e.g., numerous psychological disorders and in psychiatry and neurology). However, automation of speech analysis is a complex task that requires the integration of several different technologies within a large distributed process with numerous stakeholders. Many organizations have raised awareness about the need for robust systems for ensuring transparency, oversight, and regulation of technologies utilizing artificial intelligence. Since there is limited knowledge about the ethical and legal implications of these applications in psychological science, we provide a balanced view of both the optimism that is widely published on and also the challenges and risks of use, including discrimination and exacerbation of structural inequalities.

Shifting From Active to Passive Monitoring of Alzheimer Disease: The State of the Research.,"Most research using digital technologies builds on existing methods for staff-administered evaluation, requiring a large investment of time, effort, and resources. Widespread use of personal mobile devices provides opportunities for continuous health monitoring without active participant engagement. Home-based sensors show promise in evaluating behavioral features in near real time. Digital technologies across these methodologies can detect precise measures of cognition, mood, sleep, gait, speech, motor activity, behavior patterns, and additional features relevant to health. As a neurodegenerative condition with insidious onset, Alzheimer disease and other dementias (AD/D) represent a key target for advances in monitoring disease symptoms. Studies to date evaluating the predictive power of digital measures use inconsistent approaches to characterize these measures. Comparison between different digital collection methods supports the use of passive collection methods in settings in which active participant engagement approaches are not feasible. Additional studies that analyze how digital measures across multiple data streams can together improve prediction of cognitive impairment and early-stage AD are needed. Given the long timeline of progression from normal to diagnosis, digital monitoring will more easily make extended longitudinal follow-up possible. Through the American Heart Association-funded Strategically Focused Research Network, the Boston University investigative team deployed a platform involving a wide range of technologies to address these gaps in research practice. Much more research is needed to thoroughly evaluate limitations of passive monitoring. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to establish legal and ethical frameworks for ensuring passive monitoring can be conducted at scale while protecting privacy and security, especially in vulnerable populations.",2024,Alzheimer disease; cognition; digital health; multimodal data; passive monitoring,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Boston,"Popp, Z; Low, S; Igwe, A; Rahman, MS; Kim, M; Khan, R; Oh, E; Kumar, A; De Anda-Duran, I; Ding, H; Hwang, PH; Sunderaraman, P; Shih, LC; Lin, H; Kolachalama, VB; Au, R"

A SINE-VNTR-Alu at the LRIG2 locus is associated with proximal and distal gene expression in CRISPR and population models.,"SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons represent mobile regulatory elements that have the potential to influence the surrounding genome when they insert into a locus. Evolutionarily recent mobilisation has resulted in loci in the human genome where a given retrotransposon might be observed to be present or absent, termed a retrotransposon insertion polymorphism (RIP). We previously observed that an SVA RIP ~ 2 kb upstream of LRIG2 on chromosome 1, the 'LRIG2 SVA', was associated with differences in local gene expression and methylation, and that the two were correlated. Here, we have used CRISPR-mediated deletion of the LRIG2 SVA in a cell line model to validate that presence of the retrotransposon is directly affecting local expression and provide evidence that is suggestive of a modest role for the SVA in modulating nearby methylation. Additionally, in leveraging an available Hi-C dataset we observed that the LRIG2 SVA was also involved in long-range chromatin interactions with a cluster of genes ~ 300 kb away, and that expression of these genes was to varying degrees associated with dosage of the SVA in both CRISPR cell line and population models. Altogether, these data support a regulatory role for SVAs in the modulation of gene expression, with the latter potentially involving chromatin looping, consistent with the model that RIPs may contribute to interpersonal differences in transcriptional networks.",2024,,Humans; Retroelements; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements; Chromatin; Gene Expression; Membrane Glycoproteins,"Hall, A; Middlehurst, B; Cadogan, MAM; Reed, X; Billingsley, KJ; Bubb, VJ; Quinn, JP"

Mobile circular DNAs regulating memory and communication in CNS neurons.,"Stimuli that stimulate neurons elicit transcription of immediate-early genes, a process which requires local sites of chromosomal DNA to form double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by topoisomerase IIb within a few minutes, followed by repair within a few hours. Wakefulness, exploring a novel environment, and contextual fear conditioning also elicit turn-on of synaptic genes requiring DSBs and repair. It has been reported (in non-neuronal cells) that extrachromosomal circular DNA can form at DSBs as the sites are repaired. I propose that activated neurons may generate extrachromosomal circular DNAs during repair at DSB sites, thus creating long-lasting ""markers"" of that activity pattern which contain sequences from their sites of origin and which regulate long-term gene expression. Although the population of extrachromosomal DNAs is diverse and overall associated with pathology, a subclass of small circular DNAs (""microDNAs,"" ∼100-400 bases long), largely derives from unique genomic sequences and has attractive features to act as stable, mobile circular DNAs to regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Circular DNAs can be templates for the transcription of RNAs, particularly small inhibitory siRNAs, circular RNAs and other non-coding RNAs that interact with microRNAs. These may regulate translation and transcription of other genes involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Another possible fate for mobile DNAs is to be inserted stably into chromosomes after new DSB sites are generated in response to subsequent activation events. Thus, the insertions of mobile DNAs into activity-induced genes may tend to inactivate them and aid in homeostatic regulation to avoid over-excitation, as well as providing a ""counter"" for a neuron's activation history. Moreover, activated neurons release secretory exosomes that can be transferred to recipient cells to regulate their gene expression. Mobile DNAs may be packaged into exosomes, released in an activity-dependent manner, and transferred to recipient cells, where they may be templates for regulatory RNAs and possibly incorporated into chromosomes. Finally, aging and neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) are also associated with an increase in DSBs in neurons. It will become important in the future to assess how pathology-associated DSBs may relate to activity-induced mobile DNAs, and whether the latter may potentially contribute to pathogenesis.",2023,DNA repair; double-strand breaks; extrachromosomal circular DNA; immediate-early genes; neuronal plasticity; secretory exosomes; transcription; transposable elements,,"Smalheiser, NR"

Queuine as a potential multi-target drug for alzheimer's disease: insights from protein dynamics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a complex pathogenesis. One promising approach to treating AD is simultaneously targeting multiple aspects of the disease using a multi-target drug (MTD). In this study, multi-target drug (MTD) potential of the nutraceutical molecule Queuine was explored using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with five different protein targets engaged in AD: AChE, beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), and Synapsin III. Queuine revealed significant binding affinities, the docking scores being -10.1, -5.97, -5.63, -8.40, and -10.56 kcal/mol for AChE, BACE-1, NMDAR, MAO-A, and Synapsin III, respectively. MD simulations showed that Queuine formed stable complexes and preserved its stability throughout the simulation, the backbone fluctuations remaining within 2.5 Å specifically in the case of the BACE-1. Elastic network model simulations and principal component analysis were carried out to illustrate the dynamics of the protein systems. Significant hinge-bending and twisting-type motions that may be relevant to function were observed around the dimerization interfaces or binding sites. Structural clustering based on PCA analysis and cross-correlation maps demonstrated that Queuine binding altered the protein dynamics more drastically in the case of highly mobile proteins NMDAR and MAO-A. We propose that the neuroprotective effect of Queuine may stem from its prominent inhibitory action on enzymes BACE-1 and AChE. Our results suggest that Queuine may serve as a promising MTD candidate for the treatment of AD.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Arterial stiffness mediates the association between age and processing speed at low levels of microvascular function in humans across the adult lifespan.,"The function of micro- and macrovessels within the peripheral vasculature has been identified as a target for the investigation of potential cardiovascular-based promoters of cognitive decline. However, little remains known regarding the interaction of the micro- and macrovasculature as it relates to cognitive function, especially in cognitively healthy individuals. Therefore, our purpose was to unravel peripheral factors that contribute to the association between age and processing speed. Ninety-nine individuals (51 men, 48 women) across the adult life span (19-81 yr) were used for analysis.

Digital phenotyping: An equal opportunity approach to reducing disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"A rapidly aging world population is fueling a concomitant increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Scientific inquiry, however, has largely focused on White populations in Australia, the European Union, and North America. As such, there is an incomplete understanding of AD in other populations. In this perspective, we describe research efforts and challenges of cohort studies from three regions of the world: Central America, East Africa, and East Asia. These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

In Vitro Permeability Study of Homotaurine Using a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection Pre-Column Derivatization Method.,"Homotaurine (HOM) is considered a promising drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. In the present work, a new high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) (λex. = 340 nm and λem. = 455 nm) method was developed and validated for the study of substance permeability in the central nervous system (CNS). Analysis was performed on a RP-C18 column with a binary gradient elution system consisting of methanol-potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0, 0.02 M) as mobile phase.

Optimized Convolutional Fusion for Multimodal Neuroimaging in Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis: Enhancing Data Integration and Feature Extraction.,"Multimodal neuroimaging has gained traction in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis by integrating information from multiple imaging modalities to enhance classification accuracy. However, effectively handling heterogeneous data sources and overcoming the challenges posed by multiscale transform methods remains a significant hurdle. This article proposes a novel approach to address these challenges. To harness the power of diverse neuroimaging data, we employ a strategy that leverages optimized convolution techniques. These optimizations include varying kernel sizes and the incorporation of instance normalization, both of which play crucial roles in feature extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Specifically, varying kernel sizes allow us to adapt the receptive field to different image characteristics, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant information. Furthermore, we employ transposed convolution, which increases spatial resolution of feature maps, and it is optimized with varying kernel sizes and instance normalization. This heightened resolution facilitates the alignment and integration of data from disparate MRI and PET data. The use of larger kernels and strides in transposed convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to capture essential cross-modal relationships. Instance normalization, applied to each modality during the fusion process, mitigates potential biases stemming from differences in intensity, contrast, or scale between modalities. This enhancement contributes to improved model performance by reducing complexity and ensuring robust fusion. The performance of the proposed fusion method is assessed on three distinct neuroimaging datasets, which include: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD, and Early Mild Cognitive); Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, Mild Dementia, Very Mild Dementia); and whole-brain atlas neuroimaging (AANLIB) (consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD). To evaluate the quality of the fused images generated via our method, we employ a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), which assesses the structural similarity between two images; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which measures how closely the generated image resembles the ground truth; Entropy (E), which assesses the amount of information preserved or lost during fusion; the Feature Similarity Indexing Method (FSIM), which assesses the structural and feature similarities between two images; and Edge-Based Similarity (EBS), which measures the similarity of edges between the fused and ground truth images. The obtained fused image is further evaluated using a Mobile Vision Transformer. In the classification of AD vs. Cognitive Normal, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.00%, specificity of 99.00%, and sensitivity of 98.44% on the AANLIB dataset.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; data integration; feature extraction; multimodal neuroimaging; optimized convolution,,"Odusami, M; Maskeliūnas, R; Damaševičius, R"

Precision Medicine Approach to Alzheimer's Disease: Rationale and Implications.,"The neurodegenerative disease field has enjoyed extremely limited success in the development of effective therapeutics. One potential reason is the lack of disease models that yield accurate predictions and optimal therapeutic targets. Standard clinical trials have pre-determined a single treatment modality, which may be unrelated to the primary drivers of neurodegeneration. Recent proof-of-concept clinical trials using a precision medicine approach suggest a new model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a chronic innate encephalitis that creates a network insufficiency. Identifying and addressing the multiple potential contributors to cognitive decline for each patient may represent a more effective strategy. Here we review the rationale for a precision medicine approach in prevention and treatment of cognitive decline associated with AD. Results and implications from recent proof-of-concept clinical trials are presented. Randomized controlled trials, with much larger patient numbers, are likely to be significant to establishing precision medicine protocols as a standard of care for prevention and treatment of cognitive decline. Furthermore, combining this approach with the pharmaceutical approach offers the potential for enhanced outcomes. However, incorporating precision medicine approaches into everyday evaluation and care, as well as future clinical trials, would require fundamental changes in trial design, IRB considerations, funding considerations, laboratory evaluation, personalized treatment plans, treatment teams, and ultimately in reimbursement guidelines. Nonetheless, precision medicine approaches to AD, based on a novel model of AD pathophysiology, offer promise that has not been realized to date with monotherapeutic approaches.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; MRI volumetrics; clinical trial; mild cognitive impairment; neurodegeneration; systems,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Precision Medicine; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Bredesen, DE; Toups, K; Hathaway, A; Gordon, D; Chung, H; Raji, C; Boyd, A; Hill, BD; Hausman-Cohen, S; Attarha, M; Chwa, WJ; Kurakin, A; Jarrett, M"
Self-Administered Gentle Yoga and Yoga Breathing Intervention Improves Burden and Stress Biomarkers in Caregivers of Persons Living with Dementia.,"Family caregivers of adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the fastest growing group of informal healthcare providers in the United States. These individuals experience high levels of stress and physical and psychosocial symptoms related to their caregiving role. We provided 20 ADRD caregivers (≥ 55 years of age) with training and access to a mobile health app for at-home practice of gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises. Here, we report secondary outcomes, including changes in caregiver physical and mental function, burden, fatigue, sleep, and biological stress markers (salivary cortisol and 1,5-anhydroglucitol [1,5-AG] assays) from Baseline (Week 1) to Study End (Week 12). Self-reported questionnaire data were collected online via the Research Electronic Data Capture system, and biomarker data were collected via saliva samples. Results supported indications for slight improvement in outcomes of caregiving burden among ADRD caregivers using the gentle yoga and yoga breathing app. Furthermore, slight improvements in mental health were observed; the greatest gains were made by those reporting higher burden and having family members with more severe dementias. Findings indicate that those experiencing the greatest improvement in caregiver burden scores spent the most time doing gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises. Salivary stress biomarkers moved in a favorable direction (decreased cortisol; increased 1,5-AG) among caregivers practicing the exercises most often. This is among the first studies of gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises for relieving ADRD caregiver burden and the first we are aware of to incorporate stress biomarker measurement.",2023,Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; caregivers; mindfulness intervention; mobile health; stress biomarkers; yoga,Adult; Humans; Caregivers; Yoga; Hydrocortisone; Dementia; Biomarkers,"Balasubramanian, S; Mueller, M; Madisetti, M; Hendrix, K; Kelechi, TJ"

Microglia in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanism and potential therapeutic targets.,"Microglia activation is observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revealed that these reactive microglia were with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Some identified microglia in specific states correlate with pathological hallmarks and are associated with specific functions. Microglia both exert protective function by phagocytosing and clearing pathological protein aggregates and play detrimental roles due to excessive uptake of protein aggregates, which would lead to microglial phagocytic ability impairment, neuroinflammation, and eventually neurodegeneration. In addition, peripheral immune cells infiltration shapes microglia into a pro-inflammatory phenotype and accelerates disease progression. Microglia also act as a mobile vehicle to propagate protein aggregates. Extracellular vesicles released from microglia and autophagy impairment in microglia all contribute to pathological progression and neurodegeneration. Thus, enhancing microglial phagocytosis, reducing microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, inhibiting microglial exosome synthesis and secretion, and promoting microglial conversion into a protective phenotype are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we comprehensively review the biology of microglia and the roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and Huntington's disease. We also summarize the possible microglia-targeted interventions and treatments against neurodegenerative diseases with preclinical and clinical evidence in cell experiments, animal studies, and clinical trials.",2023,,Animals; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Microglia; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Protein Aggregates; Alzheimer Disease,"Gao, C; Jiang, J; Tan, Y; Chen, S"

The Stabilization of S100A9 Structure by Calcium Inhibits the Formation of Amyloid Fibrils.,"The calcium-binding protein S100A9 is recognized as an important component of the brain neuroinflammatory response to the onset and development of neurodegenerative disease. S100A9 is intrinsically amyloidogenic and in vivo co-aggregates with amyloid-β peptide and α-synuclein in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively. It is widely accepted that calcium dyshomeostasis plays an important role in the onset and development of these diseases, and studies have shown that elevated levels of calcium limit the potential for S100A9 to adopt a fibrillar structure. The exact mechanism by which calcium exerts its influence on the aggregation process remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that despite S100A9 exhibiting α-helical secondary structure in the absence of calcium, the protein exhibits significant plasticity with interconversion between different conformational states occurring on the micro- to milli-second timescale. This plasticity allows the population of conformational states that favour the onset of fibril formation. Magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR studies of the resulting S100A9 fibrils reveal that the S100A9 adopts a single structurally well-defined rigid fibrillar core surrounded by a shell of approximately 15-20 mobile residues, a structure that persists even when fibrils are produced in the presence of calcium ions. These studies highlight how the dysregulation of metal ion concentrations can influence the conformational equilibria of this important neuroinflammatory protein to influence the rate and nature of the amyloid deposits formed.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; S100A9; amyloid; neurodegenerative disease; protein stability,"Humans; Calcium; Amyloid; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Calcium, Dietary; Calgranulin B","Sanders, E; Csondor, R; Šulskis, D; Baronaitė, I; Smirnovas, V; Maheswaran, L; Horrocks, J; Munro, R; Georgiadou, C; Horvath, I; Morozova-Roche, LA; Williamson, PTF"
DAUF: A disease-related attentional UNet framework for progressive and stable mild cognitive impairment identification.,"Identifying progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) and stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) plays a significant role in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, which can effectively boost the life quality of patients. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN)- based methods using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images have shown effective for AD identification. However, these CNN-based methods fail to effectively explore the feature extraction of disease-related multi-scale tissues, such as ventricles, hippocampi and cerebral cortex. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end disease-related attentional UNet framework (DAUF) for identifying pMCI and sMCI, by embedding a devised dual disease-related attention module (D",2023,Complementary attention module; Disease-related attentional UNet framework; Identifying progressive and stable mild cognitive impairment; Tree-structured feature fusion,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cerebral Cortex; Cognitive Dysfunction; Heart Ventricles; Hippocampus,"Zhang, Z; Gao, L; Li, P; Jin, G; Wang, J"
Plaque vicinity as a hotspot of microglial turnover in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Microglia, the major immune cells of the brain, are functionally heterogeneous but in vivo functional properties of these cells are rarely studied at single-cell resolution. By using microRNA-9 regulated viral vectors for multicolor labeling and longitudinal in vivo monitoring of individual microglia, we followed their fate in the cortex of healthy adult mice and at the onset of amyloidosis in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In wild-type mice, microglia were rather mobile (16% of the cells migrated at least once in 10-20 days) but had a low turnover as documented by low division and death rates. Half of the migratory events were tightly associated with blood vessels. Surprisingly, basic migration properties of microglia (i.e., fraction of migrating cells, saltatory migration pattern, speed of migration, translocation distance, and strong association with blood vessels) were preserved in amyloid-depositing brains, despite amyloid plaques becoming the major destination of migration. Besides, amyloid deposition significantly increased microglial division and death rates. Moreover, the plaque vicinity became a hotspot of microglial turnover, harboring 33% of all migration, 70% of death and 54% of division events.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; amyloid; death; in vivo; microglia; migration; proliferation,,"Olmedillas, M; Brawek, B; Li, K; Richter, C; Garaschuk, O"
Use of Community-Engaged Research Approaches in Clinical Interventions for Neurologic Disorders in the United States: A Scoping Review and Future Directions for Improving Health Equity Research.,"Evidence suggests a significant prevalence of race and ethnic disparities in the United States among people with neurologic conditions including stroke, Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD), Parkinson disease (PD), epilepsy, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent neurologic research has begun the paradigm shift from observational health disparities research to intervention research in an effort to narrow the disparities gap. There is an evidence base that suggests that community engagement is a necessary component of health equity. While the increase in disparities focused neurologic interventions is encouraging, it remains unclear whether and how community-engaged practices are integrated into intervention design and implementation. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and synthesize intervention studies that have actively engaged with the community in the design and implementation of interventions to reduce disparities in neurologic conditions and to describe the common community engagement processes used.",2023,,Health Equity; Health Services Research; Humans; Community Participation; Nervous System Diseases; United States; Healthcare Disparities,"Boden-Albala, B; Rebello, V; Drum, E; Gutierrez, D; Smith, WR; Whitmer, RA; Griffith, DM"
Challenges in Using mHealth Data From Smartphones and Wearable Devices to Predict Depression Symptom Severity: Retrospective Analysis.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects millions of people worldwide, but timely treatment is not often received owing in part to inaccurate subjective recall and variability in the symptom course. Objective and frequent MDD monitoring can improve subjective recall and help to guide treatment selection. Attempts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to explore the relationship between the measures of depression and passive digital phenotypes (features) extracted from smartphones and wearables devices to remotely and continuously monitor changes in symptomatology. However, a number of challenges exist for the analysis of these data. These include maintaining participant engagement over extended time periods and therefore understanding what constitutes an acceptable threshold of missing data; distinguishing between the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships for different features to determine their utility in tracking within-individual longitudinal variation or screening individuals at high risk; and understanding the heterogeneity with which depression manifests itself in behavioral patterns quantified by the passive features.",2023,behavioral patterns; depression; digital phenotypes; missing data; mobile health; mobile phone; smartphones; wearable devices,"Humans; Smartphone; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Retrospective Studies; Telemedicine; Wearable Electronic Devices","Sun, S; Folarin, AA; Zhang, Y; Cummins, N; Garcia-Dias, R; Stewart, C; Ranjan, Y; Rashid, Z; Conde, P; Laiou, P; Sankesara, H; Matcham, F; Leightley, D; White, KM; Oetzmann, C; Ivan, A; Lamers, F; Siddi, S; Simblett, S; Nica, R; Rintala, A; Mohr, DC; Myin-Germeys, I; Wykes, T; Haro, JM; Penninx, BWJH; Vairavan, S; Narayan, VA; Annas, P; Hotopf, M; Dobson, RJB"

A Mobile Application for Supporting and Monitoring Elderly Population to Perform the Interventions of the FINGER Study.,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease that is caused by the destruction of brain neurons. It seems it affects a large group of the world's population that is estimated around 47 million and is expected to triple by 2050. Slowly but surely, the patient's condition is deteriorating, due to the increase of symptom severity, rendering him/her in need of special care. A great percentage of these cases can be attributed to some common modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, a lack of exercise, alcohol misuse, smoking, unhealthy diet, and a low level of education. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study (FINGER Study) proves that some interventions focused on the abovementioned risk factors of the individual's daily life can contribute to delay the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease. Concurrently, the rapid development of smart devices encourages the use of health applications that provide guiding tools and suggestions based on the user's status. The outcome of this paper is the development of a mobile application, to implement and monitor the interventions proposed by the FINGER Study. Based on the user's profile, it offers the ability to evaluate the likelihood of cognitive decline, monitor the process, and help delay the disease's occurrence.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; FINGER study; Mobile health application,Humans; Aged; Male; Female; Alzheimer Disease; Mobile Applications; Finland; Cognitive Dysfunction; Risk Factors,"Chalkioti, M; Exarchos, TP"
Using Biomarkers for Cognitive Enhancement and Evaluation in Mobile Applications.,"Clinicians are increasingly using biomarkers to diagnose and monitor cognitive conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Biomarkers are classified into two main categories based on their clinical goal: disease-associated biomarkers and drug-related biomarkers. In the case of disease-associated biomarkers, neuroimaging biomarkers are used to predict and validate Alzheimer's disease at any of its stages including mild cognitive impairment. The use of mobile and wearable devices to collect data about a person's daily activities and behaviors has led to the emergence of a new type of biomarker known as digital biomarkers. This type of data provides a digital reflection of a person's function in the context of everyday life and can be used to monitor and track changes in an individual's health and behaviors over time. The use of biomarkers in mobile applications for cognitive enhancement and evaluation can provide valuable insights into an individual's cognitive health and can help to optimize treatment and prevention strategies.",2023,Biomarkers; Cognitive enhancement; Digital biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Mobile Applications; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Disease Progression; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Giannopoulou, P; Vlamos, P"

Efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies in current Alzheimer's disease phase III clinical trials: A systematic review and interactive web app-based meta-analysis.,"The risk-benefit profile of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear, especially concerning their safety and overall effects on AD progression and cognitive function. Here, we investigated cognitive, biomarker and side effects of anti-Aβ mAbs in large phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in sporadic AD. The search was performed on Google Scholar, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov by applying Jadad score to evaluate the methodological quality of the reports. Studies were excluded if they scored < 3 on Jadad scale or if they analyzed less than 200 sporadic AD patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model in R. Primary outcomes were cognitive: AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary and tertiary outcomes included biomarkers of Aβ and tau pathology, adverse events, and performance on Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Scale. The meta-analysis included 14,980 patients in 14 studies and four mAbs: Bapineuzumab, Aducanumab, Solanezumab and Lecanemab. The results of this study suggest that anti-Aβ mAbs statistically improved cognitive and biomarker outcomes, particularly Aducanumab and Lecanemab. However, while cognitive effects were of small effect sizes, these drugs considerably increased risk of side effects such as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), especially in APOE-ε4 carriers. Meta-regression revealed that higher (better) baseline MMSE score was associated with improved ADAS Cog and CDR-SB.

A novel tablet-based software for the acquisition and analysis of gaze and eye movement parameters: a preliminary validation study in Parkinson's disease.,"The idea that eye movements can reflect certain aspects of brain function and inform on the presence of neurodegeneration is not a new one. Indeed, a growing body of research has shown that several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease, present characteristic eye movement anomalies and that specific gaze and eye movement parameters correlate with disease severity. The use of detailed eye movement recordings in research and clinical settings, however, has been limited due to the expensive nature and limited scalability of the required equipment. Here we test a novel technology that can track and measure eye movement parameters using the embedded camera of a mobile tablet. We show that using this technology can replicate several well-known findings regarding oculomotor anomalies in Parkinson's disease (PD), and furthermore show that several parameters significantly correlate with disease severity as assessed with the MDS-UPDRS motor subscale. A logistic regression classifier was able to accurately distinguish PD patients from healthy controls on the basis of six eye movement parameters with a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.86. This tablet-based tool has the potential to accelerate eye movement research via affordable and scalable eye-tracking and aid with the identification of disease status and monitoring of disease progression in clinical settings.",2023,Parkinson’s disease; UPDRS (unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale); biomarker; eye-tracking; gaze mapping; neurodegenerative disorders,,"de Villers-Sidani, É; Voss, P; Guitton, D; Cisneros-Franco, JM; Koch, NA; Ducharme, S"

A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk: Design and methodology of a randomized clinical trial.,"Aging populations are at increased risk of sleep deficiencies (e.g., insomnia) that are associated with a variety of chronic health risks, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Insomnia medications carry additional risk, including increased drowsiness and falls, as well as polypharmacy risks. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), but access is limited. Telehealth is one way to increase access, particularly for older adults, but to date telehealth has been typically limited to simple videoconferencing portals. While these portals have been shown to be non-inferior to in-person treatment, it is plausible that telehealth could be significantly improved. This work describes a protocol designed to evaluate whether a clinician-patient dashboard inclusive of several user-friendly features (e.g., patterns of sleep data from ambulatory devices, guided relaxation resources, and reminders to complete in-home CBTi practice) could improve CBTi outcomes for middle- to older-aged adults (N = 100). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three telehealth interventions delivered through 6-weekly sessions: (1) CBTi augmented with a clinician-patient dashboard, smartphone application, and integrated smart devices; (2) standard CBTi (i.e., active comparator); or (3) sleep hygiene education (i.e., active control). All participants were assessed at screening, pre-study evaluation, baseline, throughout treatment, and at 1-week post-treatment. The primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index.

[Mobile everyday-life digital technologies for the prevention of Alzheimer's dementia: cognitive health and cognitive safety].,"It is generally accepted that the treatment of Alzheimer's disease should be flanked by preventive measures for risk reduction in order to maintain cognitive functions for as long as possible; however, the research and development of treatment concepts are both faced with challenges. The preventive risk reduction necessitates a high level of coordination of neurology and psychiatry with other disciplines. Also, patients must develop a high level of health competence and summon up self-motivation and adherence. This concept article deals with the question of how mobile everyday-life digital technologies can help to address these challenges. The core prerequisite is the interdisciplinary coordinated structuring of prevention with the focus on cognitive health and cognitive safety. Cognitive health relates to a reduction of risk factors associated with lifestyle. Cognitive safety concerns the avoidance of iatrogenic side effects on cognitive functions. Digital technologies that are relevant in this context are mobile apps based on smartphones or tablets for everyday-life and high-frequency recording of cognitive functions, apps that can coach the implementation of lifestyle changes as companion technologies, apps that can assist in the reduction of iatrogenic risks and those that can improve the health competence of patients and relatives. The state of development of such medical products is at different stages of progress. Therefore, this concept article does not provide a review of existing products but rather deals with the fundamental interplay of potential solutions in the prevention of Alzheimer dementia in the areas of cognitive health and cognitive safety.",2023,Health competence; Interdisciplinary medicine; Preventive measures; Risk reduction; Treatment concepts,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Digital Technology; Cognition; Smartphone; Mobile Applications,"Düzel, E; Thyrian, JR"

Novel LC-MS/MS analysis of the GLP-1 analog semaglutide with its application to pharmacokinetics and brain distribution studies in rats.,"Semaglutide, one of the most potent glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 analogs, has widely been used to treat type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. Recent studies have shown that semaglutide also works on the brain, suggesting its potential utility for various diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to develop a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of semaglutide in both plasma and brain to characterize the pharmacokinetics and brain distribution in rats. Semaglutide was extracted by simple protein precipitation with methanol from plasma and by solid phase extraction from brain tissue. Liraglutide was used as an internal standard. Gradient elution profiles with mobile phases comprising 0.1 % formic acid in water and acetonitrile were used for chromatographic separation. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the LC-MS/MS assay was 0.5 ng/mL for both rat plasma and brain. Intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged 89.20-109.50 % in the plasma and 92.00-105.00 % in the brain. Precision was within 8.92 % in the plasma and 7.94 % in the brain. Sprague-Dawley rats were given semaglutide by intravenous (IV, 0.02 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) injection.

Wearable device and smartphone data quantify ALS progression and may provide novel outcome measures.,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapeutic development has largely relied on staff-administered functional rating scales to determine treatment efficacy. We sought to determine if mobile applications (apps) and wearable devices can be used to quantify ALS disease progression through active (surveys) and passive (sensors) data collection. Forty ambulatory adults with ALS were followed for 6-months. The Beiwe app was used to administer the self-entry ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-RSE) and the Rasch Overall ALS Disability Scale (ROADS) surveys every 2-4 weeks. Each participant used a wrist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph Insight Watch) or an ankle-worn activity monitor (Modus StepWatch) continuously. Wearable device wear and app survey compliance were adequate. ALSFRS-R highly correlated with ALSFRS-RSE. Several wearable data daily physical activity measures demonstrated statistically significant change over time and associations with ALSFRS-RSE and ROADS.

Design and Evaluation of a Technological Platform for Monitoring Patients with Dementia: Unifying Requirements from Mexican Day Centers.,"The monitoring of patients with dementia who receive comprehensive care in day centers allows formal caregivers to make better decisions and provide better care to patients. For instance, cognitive and physical therapies can be tailored based on the current stage of disease progression. In the context of day centers of the Mexican Federation of Alzheimer, this work aims to design and evaluate Alzaid, a technological platform for assisting formal caregivers in monitoring patients with dementia. Alzaid was devised using a participatory design methodology that consisted in eliciting and validating requirements from 22 and 9 participants, respectively, which were unified to guide the construction of a high-fidelity prototype evaluated by 14 participants. The participants were formal caregivers, medical staff, and management. This work contributes a high-fidelity prototype of a technological platform for assisting formal caregivers in monitoring patients with dementia considering restrictions and requirements of four Mexican day centers. In general, the participants perceived the prototype as quite likely to be useful, usable, and relevant in the job of monitoring patients with dementia (p-value < 0.05). By evaluating and designing Alzaid that unifies requirements for monitoring patients of four day centers, this work is the first effort towards a standard monitoring process of patients with dementia in the context of the Mexican Federation of Alzheimer.",2023,Dementia; day centers; mobile applications; patient monitoring; patients with dementia; software design,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Dementia; Caregivers; Monitoring, Physiologic","Barreras Diaz, TA; Esquer-Rochin, M; Gutierrez-Garcia, JO; Rodriguez, LF"
A New Smart 2-Min Mobile Alerting Method for Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease in the Community.,"The early identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), in an early stage of AD can expand the AD warning window. We propose a new capability index evaluating the spatial execution process (SEP), which can dynamically evaluate the execution process in the space navigation task. The hypothesis is proposed that there are neurobehavioral differences between normal cognitive (NC) elderly and AD patients with MCI reflected in digital biomarkers captured during SEP. According to this, we designed a new smart 2-min mobile alerting method for MCI due to AD, for community screening. Two digital biomarkers, total mission execution distance (METRtotal) and execution distance above the transverse obstacle (EDabove), were selected by step-up regression analysis. For the participants with more than 9 years of education, the alerting efficiency of the combination of the two digital biomarkers for MCI due to AD could reach 0.83. This method has the advantages of fast speed, high alerting efficiency, low cost and high intelligence and thus has a high application value for community screening in developing countries. It also provides a new intelligent alerting approach based on the human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigm for MCI due to AD in community screening.",2023,alerting in the community; digital biomarkers; mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease; spatial execution process,,"Wang, Y; Chen, T; Wang, C; Ogihara, A; Ma, X; Huang, S; Zhou, S; Li, S; Liu, J; Li, K"

Digital Intervention For The Management Of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial, chronic, neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence and limited therapeutic options, making it a global health crisis. Being the most common cause of dementia, AD erodes the cognitive, functional, and social abilities of the individual and causes escalating medical and psychosocial needs. As yet, this disorder has no cure and current treatment options are palliative in nature. There is an urgent need for novel therapy to address this pressing challenge. Digital therapeutics (Dtx) is one such novel therapy that is gaining popularity globally. Dtx provides evidence based therapeutic interventions driven by internet and software, employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames, apps, sensors, virtual reality aiding in the prevention, management, and treatment of ailments like neurological abnormalities and chronic diseases. Dtx acts as a supportive tool for the optimization of patient care, individualized treatment and improved health outcomes. Dtx uses visual, sound and other non-invasive approaches for instance-consistent therapy, reminiscence therapy, computerised cognitive training, semantic and phonological assistance devices, wearables and computer-assisted rehabilitation environment to find applications in Alzheimer's disease for improving memory, cognition, functional abilities and managing motor symptom. A few of the Dtx-based tools employed in AD include ""Memory Matters"", ""AlzSense"", ""Alzheimer Assistant"", ""smart robotic dog"", ""Immersive virtual reality (iVR)"" and the most current gamma stimulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current trends in digital health in AD and explore the benefits, challenges, and impediments of using Dtx as an adjunctive therapy for the management of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Dementia; Digital health.; Internet of things; Mobile apps; Reminiscence therapy,,"Manchanda, N; Aggarwal, A; Setya, S; Talegaonkar, S"

"Landmark-dependent Navigation Strategy Declines across the Human Life-Span: Evidence from Over 37,000 Participants.","Humans show a remarkable capacity to navigate various environments using different navigation strategies, and we know that strategy changes across the life span. However, this observation has been based on studies of small sample sizes. To this end, we used a mobile app-based video game (Sea Hero Quest) to test virtual navigation strategies and memory performance within a distinct radial arm maze level in over 37,000 participants. Players were presented with six pathways (three open and three closed) and were required to navigate to the three open pathways to collect a target. Next, all six pathways were made available and the player was required to visit the pathways that were previously unavailable. Both reference memory and working memory errors were calculated. Crucially, at the end of the level, the player was asked a multiple-choice question about how they found the targets (i.e., a counting-dependent strategy vs. a landmark-dependent strategy). As predicted from previous laboratory studies, we found the use of landmarks declined linearly with age. Those using landmark-based strategies also performed better on reference memory than those using a counting-based strategy. These results extend previous observations in the laboratory showing a decreased use of landmark-dependent strategies with age.",2023,,"Humans; Longevity; Space Perception; Memory, Short-Term; Video Games; Spatial Navigation","West, GL; Patai, ZE; Coutrot, A; Hornberger, M; Bohbot, VD; Spiers, HJ"

Research is needed to develop novel interventions that leverage mobile health (mHealth) technologies to help older adults increase their engagement in PA in free-living environments, reducing participant burden and increasing generalizability of research findings. Moreover, promoting engagement in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) may be most beneficial to brain health; thus, using mHealth to help older adults increase time spent in MVPA in free-living environments may help to offset the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and improve quality of life in older age.",2023,adaptive intervention; brain perfusion; clinical trial; cognition; digital health; exercise; feasibility; mechanisms; older adults; real time; real world; seniors,,"Hays Weeks, CC; Moore, AA; Allison, M; Patrick, K; Bondi, MW; Nebeker, C; Liu, TT; Wing, D; Higgins, M; Hartman, SJ; Rissman, RA; Zlatar, ZZ"
Analysis of Tau/Nucleoporin Interactions by Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy.,"Tau, a soluble and predominantly neuronal protein, is best known for its microtubule (MT)-binding function in the cytosol, where it decisively contributes to stability as well as modulation of MT dynamics. In Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, Tau is altered into forming intracellular neurofibrillary tangles; additionally, also a mislocalization from the cytosol to the nucleus has been observed where interactions of Tau with the nucleus become possible. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), it was recently shown that Tau can directly interact with certain nucleoporins (e.g., Nup98), components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC constitutes large regulated pores in the nuclear envelope that facilitate the bidirectional exchange of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules between the inner section of the nucleus and the cytosol, the nucleocytoplasmic transport. The mechanism of Tau/Nup interactions is as yet unknown, and a systematic interaction analysis of Tau with different Nups can be of high value to decipher the molecular binding mechanism of Tau to Nups. SPR is a useful tool to analyze binding affinities and kinetic parameters in a label-free environment. While one interaction partner is immobilized on a sensor chip, the second is supplied within a constant flow of buffer. Binding of mobile molecules to immobilized ones changes the refractive index of the medium close to the sensor surface with the signal being proportional to the bound mass. In this chapter, we describe the application of the SPR technique for the investigation of Tau binding to nucleoporins.",2023,Biacore; MAPT; Nuclear pore complex (NPC); Nup98; Surface plasmon resonance (SPR); Tau,"Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; Nuclear Pore; Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins; Proteins; Spectrum Analysis; Surface Plasmon Resonance; tau Proteins","Diez, L; Kapinos, LE; Lim, RYH; Wegmann, S"
Determination of Catecholamines in a Small Volume (25 μL) of Plasma from Conscious Mouse Tail Vein.,"The determination of plasma catecholamine levels is commonly used as a measure of the sympathetic nervous system's response to stress and is highly important for diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases, catecholamine-secreting tumors arising from the chromaffin cells of the sympathoadrenal system, and affective disorders. Diseases in which catecholamines are significantly elevated include pheochromocytoma, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, von Hippel-Lindau disease, baroreflex failure, chemodectina (nonchromaffin paraganglioma), and multiple endocrine neoplasia. Plasma norepinephrine levels provide a guide to prognosis in patients with stable, chronic, and congestive heart diseases. The method described here for the determination of plasma catecholamines is based on the principle that plasma catecholamines are selectively adsorbed on acid-washed alumina at pH 8.7 and then eluted at a pH between 1.0 and 2.0. Upon injection, catecholamines in elutes were separated by a reversed phase C-18 column. After separation, the catecholamines present within the mobile phase enter the electrochemical detector. Electrochemical detection occurs because electroactive compounds oxidize at a certain potential and thereby liberate electrons that create measurable current. Catecholamines readily form quinones under these conditions, get oxidized, release two electrons, and create current. The electrochemical detector detects this electrical current that linearly correlates to the catecholamine concentration loaded into the ultra-performance liquid chromatography instrument. A 15-min mixing time during the adsorption and desorption steps was found to be optimal. If the washing step was omitted, the catecholamines could not be eluted from the acid-washed alumina. To prevent dilution, the alumina had to be centrifuged and not aspirated to dryness after the washing step. We report here that by changing the range in the electrochemical detector, plasma catecholamines were measured with only 12.5 μL of plasma and more reliably with 25 μL of plasma. The detection limit was 1 ng/mL. This assay method is very useful as blood can be collected from the tail vein in a conscious mouse and the same mouse can be used for time-dependent or age-dependent studies.",2023,Catecholamine; Chromatography; Dopamine; Electrochemical detection; Epinephrine; Norepinephrine; Plasma,"Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Aluminum Oxide; Animals; Catecholamines; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Mice; Norepinephrine; Quinones; Tail","Tang, K; Mahata, SK"

ARC was designed to be administered unsupervised using participants' personal devices in their everyday environments.",2023,digital biomarkers; ecological momentary assessment; mobile testing; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Reproducibility of Results; Cognition; Biomarkers; Positron-Emission Tomography; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Nicosia, J; Aschenbrenner, AJ; Balota, DA; Sliwinski, MJ; Tahan, M; Adams, S; Stout, SS; Wilks, H; Gordon, BA; Benzinger, TLS; Fagan, AM; Xiong, C; Bateman, RJ; Morris, JC; Hassenstab, J"
White matter hyperintensities in former American football players.,"The presentation, risk factors, and etiologies of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in people exposed to repetitive head impacts are unknown. We examined the burden and distribution of WMH, and their association with years of play, age of first exposure, and clinical function in former American football players.",2023,aging; cerebrovascular disease; concussion; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; football; microvascular disease; neurodegenerative disease; repetitive head impacts; subconcussion; white matter hyperintensities; white matter injury,Male; Humans; Aged; Middle Aged; Football; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Executive Function,"Alosco, ML; Tripodis, Y; Baucom, ZH; Adler, CH; Balcer, LJ; Bernick, C; Mariani, ML; Au, R; Banks, SJ; Barr, WB; Wethe, JV; Cantu, RC; Coleman, MJ; Dodick, DW; McClean, MD; McKee, AC; Mez, J; Palmisano, JN; Martin, B; Hartlage, K; Lin, AP; Koerte, IK; Cummings, JL; Reiman, EM; Stern, RA; Shenton, ME; Bouix, S"
Older Adults' Views on Social Interactions and Online Socializing Games - A Qualitative Study.,"Age-related difficulties and quarantine restrictions impede the possibilities to maintain contact with one's social network. Maintaining these contacts may be supported by digital games. To develop effective and feasible digital tools to foster social interaction, we aimed to explore what older adults find important in social contact and what barriers and enablers they foresee in digital gaming interventions as network support aids. Two focus groups and 20 semi-structured interviews (N = 29) with older adults (aged 55-87) were held to explore the research questions. Furthermore, a questionnaire was administered (N = 29) containing measures of loneliness, frailty, and social network size. Participants found 'reciprocity', 'in-person contact', and 'personal connection' important in contact with strong ties. Online games were not used much for socializing but may be used in the future, particularly by less mobile older adults. Future social gaming interventions should be challenging, user-friendly, and offer the possibility to communicate. Digital co-designed interventions that are feasible, challenging, intuitive, and trigger meaningful communication may strengthen social interactions in older adults. They may be a relevant social support tool in periods of interaction limitations due to functional impairment or social isolation.",2023,Social contact; co-design; digital technology; loneliness; qualitative research; social isolation,Humans; Aged; Social Interaction; Social Isolation; Loneliness; Social Behavior; Social Support,"Janssen, JHM; Kremers, EM; Nieuwboer, MS; Châtel, BDL; Corten, R; Olde Rikkert, MGM; Peeters, GMEEG"
Explaining World-Wide Variation in Navigation Ability from Millions of People: Citizen Science Project Sea Hero Quest.,"Navigation ability varies widely across humans. Prior studies have reported that being younger and a male has an advantage for navigation ability. However, these studies have generally involved small numbers of participants from a handful of western countries. Here, we review findings from our project Sea Hero Quest, which used a video game for mobile and tablet devices to test 3.9 million people on their navigation ability, sampling across every nation-state and from 18 to 99 years of age. Results revealed that the task has good ecological validity and across all countries sufficiently sampled (N = 63), age is linked to a near-linear decline in navigation ability from the early 20s. All countries showed a male advantage, but this varied considerably and could be partly predicted by gender inequality. We found that those who reported growing up in a city were on average worse at navigating than those who grew up outside cities and that navigation performance helped identify those at greater genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease. We discuss the advantages and challenges of using a mobile app to study cognition and the future avenues for understanding individual differences in navigation ability arising from this research.",2023,Aging; Culture; Dementia; Games; Gender; Spatial cognition; Wayfinding,Humans; Male; Citizen Science; Spatial Navigation; Cognition; Individuality; Video Games,"Spiers, HJ; Coutrot, A; Hornberger, M"
