Exploring the Relationship between Behavioral and Neurological Impairments Due to Mild Cognitive Impairment: Correlation Study between Virtual Kiosk Test and EEG-SSVEP.,"Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease, making early screening imperative for potential intervention and prevention of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, there is a demand for research to identify effective and easy-to-use tools for aMCI screening. While behavioral tests in virtual reality environments have successfully captured behavioral features related to instrumental activities of daily living for aMCI screening, further investigations are necessary to establish connections between cognitive decline and neurological changes. Utilizing electroencephalography with steady-state visual evoked potentials, this study delved into the correlation between behavioral features recorded during virtual reality tests and neurological features obtained by measuring neural activity in the dorsal stream. As a result, this multimodal approach achieved an impressive screening accuracy of 98.38%.",2024,brain–computer interface; human cognition; instrumental activities of daily living; steady-state visual evoked potentials; virtual reality,"Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Electroencephalography; Aged; Male; Female; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Virtual Reality; Alzheimer Disease; Neuropsychological Tests; Activities of Daily Living; Middle Aged","Kim, D; Kim, Y; Park, J; Choi, H; Ryu, H; Loeser, M; Seo, K"
Characteristics of the top 100 cited electroencephalography articles on aging: a bibliometric analysis.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used tool in neuroscience. To explore the features of the top 100 cited articles related to EEG and aging over the past decade, we conducted a bibliometric analysis using Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) data as of January 21, 2024. The selected top 100 cited papers were analyzed using VOSviewer and Excel. We examined the distribution of publication years, authors, institutions, countries/regions, and journals. Hotspots were identified through keyword analysis. The analyzed articles were published between 2014 and 2021, with the majority being published before 2020 (n=91). Citation counts in WoSCC ranged from 24 to 250, with a median of 40 and a mean of 53. A total of 818 authors from 283 institutions in 35 countries/territories contributed to these top papers. The United States of America (USA) (n=37), Germany (n=14), and Canada (n=11) ranked in the top three in terms of total publications or citations. The predominant journals were in the fields of Neuroscience (n=58), Geriatrics & Gerontology (n=22), Clinical Neurology (n=13), and Anesthesiology (n=9), which published most of the high-quality articles. Key themes included EEG, aging, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, functional connectivity, and alpha oscillations. Emerging topics included sleep, machine learning, delirium, postoperative cognitive function, virtual reality, monitoring, resting state, coherence, and transcranial direct current stimulation. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the trends in scientific literature on EEG in aging over the past decade. Authors and institutions from North America, Europe, and East Asia led in contributions. Journals focusing on neuroscience, geriatrics, and anesthesiology published the majority of articles. Degenerative neurological diseases and cognitive impairment were prominent topics, suggesting future studies should explore EEG's diagnostic utility for these disorders.",2024,Bibliometric analysis; electroencephalography; hot spots; the elderly; top papers,,"Pu, Y; Tian, P; Huang, Z"

Multidimensional assessment of social cognition using non-immersive virtual reality in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease: an exploratory study.,"Few studies have focused on social cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), even though some brain structures being well known as underlying social cognitive processes are directly impacted in this disease. Furthermore, social cognition processes have been mostly studied independently using evaluations with poor ecological validity. We aimed at studying the ability of a new naturalistic and multidimensional social cognition task to reveal impairments in DLB patients. We chose to compare the profile of these patients with that of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, for which social cognition is better preserved.",2024,Dementia; empathy; moral cognition; neuropsychology; theory of mind,,"Msika, EF; Verny, M; Dieudonné, B; Ehrlé, N; Gaston-Bellegarde, A; Orriols, E; Piolino, P; Narme, P"
The use of virtual reality as a perspective-taking manipulation to improve self-awareness in Alzheimer's disease.,"Lack of awareness of symptoms or having a condition referred to as anosognosia is a common feature of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Previous literature on AD reported difficulties in evaluating self-abilities, often showing underestimation of limitations. There is increasing evidence that the perspective through which information is presented may moderate the performance appraisal and that anosognosia in AD might be a consequence of a deficit in assuming a third-person perspective. In this context, some studies showed that subjects may better recognize self-and other-difficulties when exposed to a third-person perspective. Considering the variety of approaches aiming to investigate the lack of awareness, there is still a scarcity of methods that provide great ecological validity and consider more than one facet of awareness, thus failing to offer more accurate evaluations of daily experiences. The present paper primarily addresses the theme of the multidimensional character of awareness of abilities in AD and the effect of perspective-taking on its trajectories. The focus turns to virtual reality as a promising tool for a greater evaluation of perspective-taking and self-awareness. Particularly, these systems offer the possibility to involve users in cognitive and sensorimotor tasks that simulate daily life conditions within immersive and realistic environments, and a great sense of embodiment. We propose that virtual reality might allow a great level of complexity, veracity, and safety that is needed for individuals with AD to behave according to their actual abilities and enable to explore the liaison between the subject's viewpoint, performance, and self-evaluation. In addition, we suggest promising clinical implications of virtual reality-based methods for individualized assessments, investigating specific impacts on subjects' life and possible improvements in their awareness.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; anosognosia; perspective-taking; self-awareness; virtual reality,,"Latgé-Tovar, S; Bertrand, E; Piolino, P; Mograbi, DC"
Differential disruptions in population coding along the dorsal-ventral axis of CA1 in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Aβ pathology.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by a range of behavioral alterations, including memory loss and psychiatric symptoms. While there is evidence that molecular pathologies, such as amyloid beta (Aβ), contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology gives rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis is that Aβ exerts differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the neurophysiology and connectivity of different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), two hippocampal areas known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in the APP/PS1 mouse model of amyloidosis. Despite similar levels of Aβ pathology, dCA1 and vCA1 showed distinct disruptions in neuronal population activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dCA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in APP/PS1 mice relative to age-matched C57BL/6 controls. However, in vCA1, APP/PS1 mice had increased pair-wise correlations and entropy as compared to age matched controls. Finally, using maximum entropy models, we connected the microscopic features of population activity (correlations) to the macroscopic features of the population code (entropy). We found that the models' performance increased in predicting dCA1 activity, but decreased in predicting vCA1 activity, in APP/PS1 mice relative to the controls. Taken together, we found that Aβ exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions, suggesting that the various behavioral deficits of AD may reflect underlying heterogeneities in neuronal circuits and the different disruptions that Aβ pathology causes in those circuits.",2024,,"Animals; Male; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; Computational Biology; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Neurons; Presenilin-1","Chockanathan, U; Padmanabhan, K"
Bodily and Visual-Cognitive Navigation Aids to Enhance Spatial Recall in Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) syndrome often report navigation difficulties, accompanied by impairments in egocentric and allocentric spatial memory.

Integrating Biomarkers From Virtual Reality and Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using a Multimodal Learning Approach: Validation Study.,"Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer disease, is crucial for preventing the progression of dementia. Virtual reality (VR) biomarkers have proven to be effective in capturing behaviors associated with subtle deficits in instrumental activities of daily living, such as challenges in using a food-ordering kiosk, for early detection of MCI. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers have demonstrated their efficacy in quantifying observable structural brain changes that can aid in early MCI detection. Nevertheless, the relationship between VR-derived and MRI biomarkers remains an open question. In this context, we explored the integration of VR-derived and MRI biomarkers to enhance early MCI detection through a multimodal learning approach.",2024,MRI; VR; early detection; eye movement; hand movement; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment; multimodal learning; virtual reality,Humans; Aged; Activities of Daily Living; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Virtual Reality,"Park, B; Kim, Y; Park, J; Choi, H; Kim, SE; Ryu, H; Seo, K"

Sensory Integration: A Novel Approach for Healthy Ageing and Dementia Management.,"Sensory processing is a fundamental aspect of the nervous system that plays a pivotal role in the cognitive decline observed in older individuals with dementia. The ""sensory diet"", derived from sensory integration theory, may provide a tailored approach to modulating sensory experiences and triggering neuroplastic changes in the brain in individuals with dementia. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate the current knowledge regarding the sensory diet and its potential application to dementia. This review encompassed an extensive search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, covering articles published from 2010 to 2023. Keywords such as ""sensory integration"", ""sensory modulation"", ""healthy aging"", and ""dementia"" were utilized to identify relevant studies. The types of materials retrieved included peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, ensuring a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape. This article offers a comprehensive exploration of the effectiveness of sensory diets such as tactile stimulation, auditory therapies, and visual interventions, which have demonstrated noteworthy efficacy in addressing challenges linked to aging and dementia. Research findings consistently report positive outcomes, such as improved cognitive function, elevated emotional well-being, and enhanced overall quality of life in older individuals. Furthermore, we found that the integration of sensory diets with the metaverse, augmented reality, and virtual reality opens up personalized experiences, fostering cognitive stimulation and emotional well-being for individuals during aging. Therefore, we conclude that customized sensory diets, based on interdisciplinary cooperation and leveraging technological advancements, are effective in optimizing sensory processing and improve the overall well-being of older individuals contending with sensory modulation challenges and dementia.",2024,dementia; healthy aging; neuromodulation; sensory integration,,"Maneemai, O; Cujilan Alvarado, MC; Calderon Intriago, LG; Donoso Triviño, AJ; Franco Coffré, JA; Pratico, D; Schwartz, K; Tesfaye, T; Yamasaki, T"
Early detection of diseases causing dementia using digital navigation and gait measures: A systematic review of evidence.,"Wearable digital technologies capable of measuring everyday behaviors could improve the early detection of dementia-causing diseases. We conducted two systematic reviews following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to establish the evidence base for measuring navigation and gait, two everyday behaviors affected early in AD and non-AD disorders and not adequately measured in current practice. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies on asymptomatic and early-stage symptomatic individuals at risk of dementia, with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale used to assess bias and evaluate methodological quality. Of 316 navigation and 2086 gait records identified, 27 and 83, respectively, were included in the final sample. We highlight several measures that may identify at-risk individuals, whose quantifiability with different devices mitigates the risk of future technological obsolescence. Beyond navigation and gait, this review also provides the framework for evaluating the evidence base for future digital measures of behaviors considered for early disease detection.",2024,ambulation; digital technology; gait; navigation; preclinical dementia; prodromal dementia; smartphones; virtual reality; wearables,"Humans; Gait; Early Diagnosis; Wearable Electronic Devices; Databases, Factual; Dementia","Čepukaitytė, G; Newton, C; Chan, D"

Virtual Reality and Serious Videogame-Based Instruments for Assessing Spatial Navigation in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review of Psychometric Properties.,"Over the past decade, research using virtual reality and serious game-based instruments for assessing spatial navigation and spatial memory in at-risk and AD populations has risen. We systematically reviewed the literature since 2012 to identify and evaluate the methodological quality and risk of bias in the analyses of the psychometric properties of VRSG-based instruments. The search was conducted primarily in July-December 2022 and updated in November 2023 in eight major databases. The quality of instrument development and study design were analyzed in all studies. Measurement properties were defined and analyzed according to COSMIN guidelines. A total of 1078 unique records were screened, and following selection criteria, thirty-seven studies were analyzed. From these studies, 30 instruments were identified. Construct and criterion validity were the most reported measurement properties, while structural validity and internal consistency evidence were the least reported. Nineteen studies were deemed very good in construct validity, whereas 11 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy were deemed very good in quality. Limitations regarding theoretical framework and research design requirements were found in most of the studies. VRSG-based instruments are valuable additions to the current diagnostic toolkit for AD. Further research is required to establish the psychometric performance and clinical utility of VRSG-based instruments, particularly the instrument development, content validity, and diagnostic accuracy for preclinical AD screening scenarios. This review provides a straightforward synthesis of the state of the art of VRSG-based instruments and suggests future directions for research.",2024,Alzheimer disease; COSMIN; Digital neuropsychology; Psychometric properties; Serious games; Systematic review; Virtual reality,,"Sánchez-Escudero, JP; Galvis-Herrera, AM; Sánchez-Trujillo, D; Torres-López, LC; Kennedy, CJ; Aguirre-Acevedo, DC; Garcia-Barrera, MA; Trujillo, N"
Path integration deficits are associated with phosphorylated tau accumulation in the entorhinal cortex.,"Alzheimer's disease is a devastating disease that is accompanied by dementia, and its incidence increases with age. However, no interventions have exhibited clear therapeutic effects. We aimed to develop and characterize behavioural tasks that allow the earlier identification of signs preceding dementia that would facilitate the development of preventative and therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease. To this end, we developed a 3D virtual reality task sensitive to the activity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, which is the region that first exhibits neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated path integration (assessed by error distance) in a spatial navigation task sensitive to grid cells in the entorhinal cortex in 177 volunteers, aged 20-89 years, who did not have self-reported dementia. While place memory was intact even in old age, path integration deteriorated with increasing age. To investigate the relationship between neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex and path integration deficit, we examined a mouse model of tauopathy (P301S mutant tau-overexpressing mice; PS19 mice). At 6 months of age, PS19 mice showed a significant accumulation of phosphorylated tau only in the entorhinal cortex, associated with impaired path integration without impairments in spatial cognition. These data are consistent with the idea that path integration deficit is caused by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau in the entorhinal cortex. This method may allow the early identification of individuals likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.",2024,3D virtual reality task; entorhinal cortex; neurofibrillary tangle (NFT); path integration,,"Koike, R; Soeda, Y; Kasai, A; Fujioka, Y; Ishigaki, S; Yamanaka, A; Takaichi, Y; Chambers, JK; Uchida, K; Watanabe, H; Takashima, A"

Applications of Artificial Intelligence in the Neuropsychological Assessment of Dementia: A Systematic Review.,"In the context of advancing healthcare, the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders, particularly Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), pose significant challenges. This review explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in neuropsychological assessment for the early detection and personalized treatment of MCI and AD. The review includes 37 articles that demonstrate that AI could be an useful instrument for optimizing diagnostic procedures, predicting cognitive decline, and outperforming traditional tests. Three main categories of applications are identified: (1) combining neuropsychological assessment with clinical data, (2) optimizing existing test batteries using ML techniques, and (3) employing virtual reality and games to overcome the limitations of traditional tests. Despite advancements, the review highlights a gap in developing tools that simplify the clinician's workflow and underscores the need for explainable AI in healthcare decision making. Future studies should bridge the gap between technical performance measures and practical clinical utility to yield accurate results and facilitate clinicians' roles. The successful integration of AI/ML in predicting dementia onset could reduce global healthcare costs and benefit aging societies.",2024,artificial intelligence; dementia; machine learning; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychological assessment,,"Veneziani, I; Marra, A; Formica, C; Grimaldi, A; Marino, S; Quartarone, A; Maresca, G"
Digital Therapeutics for Improving Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Drugs and Biological Products: Preclinical and Clinical Studies Supporting Development of Drug + Digital Combination Therapies for Chronic Diseases.,"Limitations of pharmaceutical drugs and biologics for chronic diseases (e.g., medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, or inadequate efficacy) can be mitigated by mobile medical apps, known as digital therapeutics (DTx). Authorization of adjunct DTx by the US Food and Drug Administration and draft guidelines on ""prescription drug use-related software"" illustrate opportunities to create drug + digital combination therapies, ultimately leading towards drug-device combination products (DTx has a status of medical devices). Digital interventions (mobile, web-based, virtual reality, and video game applications) demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for people living with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. In the respective animal disease models, preclinical studies on environmental enrichment and other non-pharmacological modalities (physical activity, social interactions, learning, and music) as surrogates for DTx ""active ingredients"" also show improved outcomes.

We included meta-analyses relevant to our study objectives for the overall review. We assessed the methodological quality according to AMSTAR2, and we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) method to assess the credibility of the evidence. This overall review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023423063). We identified six meta-analyses that included 12 cognitive outcomes, but only memory (Standardized Mean Difference(SMD) = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.49), depression (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI: -1.8 to -0.72), and global cognition (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.66) improved through the VR technology intervention.

Augmented reality versus standard tests to assess cognition and function in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Augmented reality (AR) apps, in which the virtual and real world are combined, can recreate instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and are therefore promising to measure cognition needed for IADL in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) both in the clinic and in the home settings. The primary aim of this study was to distinguish and classify healthy controls (HC) from participants with AD pathology in an early AD stage using an AR app. The secondary aims were to test the association of the app with clinical cognitive and functional tests and investigate the feasibility of at-home testing using AR. We furthermore investigated the test-retest reliability and potential learning effects of the task. The digital score from the AR app could significantly distinguish HC from preclinical AD (preAD) and prodromal AD (proAD), and preAD from proAD, both with in-clinic and at-home tests.

Reduced overnight memory consolidation and associated alterations in sleep spindles and slow oscillations in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Spatial navigation critically underlies hippocampal-entorhinal circuit function that is early affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is growing evidence that AD pathophysiology dynamically interacts with the sleep/wake cycle impairing hippocampal memory. To elucidate sleep-dependent consolidation in a cohort of symptomatic AD patients (n = 12, 71.25 ± 2.16 years), we tested hippocampal place learning by means of a virtual reality task and verbal memory by a word-pair association task before and after a night of sleep. Our results show an impaired overnight memory retention in AD compared with controls in the verbal task, together with a significant reduction of sleep spindle activity (i.e., lower amplitude of fast sleep spindles, p = 0.016) and increased duration of the slow oscillation (SO; p = 0.019). Higher spindle density, faster down-to-upstate transitions within SOs, and the time delay between SOs and nested spindles predicted better memory performance in healthy controls but not in AD patients. Our results show that mnemonic processing and memory consolidation in AD is slightly impaired as reflected by dysfunctional oscillatory dynamics and spindle-SO coupling during NonREM sleep. In this translational study based on experimental paradigms in animals and extending previous work in healthy aging and preclinical disease stages, our results in symptomatic AD further deepen the understanding of the memory decline within a bidirectional relationship of sleep and AD pathology.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Hippocampal memory; Sleep-dependent memory consolidation; Spatial navigation; Spindles,Humans; Memory Consolidation; Alzheimer Disease; Polysomnography; Sleep; Memory; Memory Disorders,"Hanert, A; Schönfeld, R; Weber, FD; Nowak, A; Döhring, J; Philippen, S; Granert, O; Burgalossi, A; Born, J; Berg, D; Göder, R; Häussermann, P; Bartsch, T"

Overestimation in angular path integration precedes Alzheimer's dementia.,"Path integration (PI) is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but reflects multiple sub-processes that may be differentially sensitive to AD. To characterize these sub-processes, we developed a novel generative linear-angular model of PI (GLAMPI) to fit the inbound paths of healthy elderly participants performing triangle completion, a popular PI task, in immersive virtual reality with real movement. The model fits seven parameters reflecting the encoding, calculation, and production errors associated with inaccuracies in PI. We compared these parameters across younger and older participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), including those with (MCI+) and without (MCI-) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD neuropathology. MCI patients showed overestimation of the angular turn in the outbound path and more variable inbound distances and directions compared with healthy elderly. MCI+ were best distinguished from MCI- patients by overestimation of outbound turns and more variable inbound directions. Our results suggest that overestimation of turning underlies the PI errors seen in patients with early AD, indicating specific neural pathways and diagnostic behaviors for further research.",2023,cognitive neuroscience; computational modeling; entorhinal cortex; grid cells; mild cognitive impairment; navigation; virtual reality,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Castegnaro, A; Ji, Z; Rudzka, K; Chan, D; Burgess, N"
The Application of Fully Immersive Virtual Reality on Reminiscence Interventions for Older Adults: Scoping Review.,"The increasing number of older adults with mental, behavioral, and memory challenges presents significant public health concerns. Reminiscence is one type of nonpharmacological intervention that can effectively evoke memories, stimulate mental activities, and improve psychological well-being in older adults through a series of discussions on previous experiences. Fully immersive virtual reality (FIVR) may be a useful tool for reminiscence interventions because it uses realistic virtual environments connected to a person's significant past stories.",2023,Alzheimer; cognitive function; dementia; fully immersive virtual reality; memory care; mental health; older adults; psychological well-being; reminiscence; scoping review,,"Lu, Z; Wang, W; Yan, W; Kew, CL; Seo, JH; Ory, M"
A Pilot Fuzzy System with Virtual Reality for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Assessment.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is when brain function declines. MCI is the gray area transitioning from normal aging to the AD stage. Currently, the majority of early MCI diagnoses are processed through comprehensive neuropsychological tests. These tests may take the form of interviews, paper-and-pencil tests, or computer-based tests. There may be resistance from the subject if he/she has to undergo many screening tests simultaneously for multiple evaluation information, resulting in execution difficulty. The objectives of this study are to use 3D virtual reality to create an entertaining test scenario integrating the Mini-Cog, SPMSQ, MMSE, SLUMS, CDR, and CASI for middle-aged to older adults, furthermore, to employ fuzzy logic control (FLC) technology to develop a ""MCI assessment system"" for obtaining some pilot information for MCI assessment. There were 24 middle-aged to older adults aged from 50 to 65 years who participated in the evaluation experiment. The results showed that the MCI assessment system developed in this study is highly correlated with the traditional screening tests, including the Mini-Cog, SPMSQ, MMSE, SLUMS, and CASI. The assessment system can provide an integrated reference score for clinic workers in making judgments. In addition, the distribution of the System Usability Scale (SUS) evaluation scores for the MCI assessment system revealed that 87.5% were grade C (good to use) or above and 29.2% were grade B (extremely good to use) or above. The assessment system received positive feedback from the subjects.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; fuzzy logic control; mild cognitive impairment; screening tool; virtual reality,,"Liu, CL; Chuang, CJ; Chou, CM"

European Projects for Patients with Dementia and Their Caregivers.,"As we all know there is no treatment that can stop or delay the progression of dementia. The treatment we use is only symptomatic. EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) recommendations for dementia prevention by Sorbi et al. (2012) concluded that there is no treatment, no lifestyle, which could have an effect on prevention or delay of onset of different forms of dementia until today. The future studies in prevention must recruit younger people, larger sample, and for longer period. The last 10 years we have run, in collaboration with organizations in different European countries, many projects in order to support patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly patients with dementia and their caregivers. The first project was a 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe: predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS (Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe) study, an FP5 project with 1380 patients. Five studies were published. The second project was DESCRIPA study, an FP5 project to DEvelopment of Screening guidelines and clinical CRIteria for Predementia Alzheimer's disease, with 881 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). LLM (Long Lasting Memories) and VRADA (A virtual reality application for the exercise of dementia and Alzheimer patients) are two projects that include body and cognitive exercise for health for the elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment. The next is the RECAGE (REspectful Caring for the AGitated Elderly) project (Horizon 2020), a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. With six European universities we finished a very interesting FP6 project, the AddNeuroMed one, which gives even now information about the progression of normal elderly MCI and AD patients, in collaboration with other consortia. A very interesting Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project about digital biomarkers was entitled Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR project). The main goal of this project was the development and validation of technology-enabled, quantitative and sensitive measures of functional decline in people with early-stage AD. A running project is an Erasmus+ one in the higher education field, ""Genetic counseling in European universities: The case of neurodegenerative diseases"" (GECONEU project). The target of this study is to develop an online course for university students focusing on genetic counseling, and support people and society to better understand the aims of genetic testing and the usefulness of genetic counseling by involving students in an innovative learning and teaching setting. AD-gaming, BRIDGE, iCONNECT (Intergenerational CONtact between studeNts and people with dEmentia through CreaTive education), E.L.So.M.C.I (English Lessons with the Use of Songs for People with Mild Cognitive Impairment), Games4CoSkills, and De-Sign are all Erasmus+ projects that aim to improve the quality of life of patients with MCI or dementia.

Effects of Exercise-based Management on Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease - A Meta-analysis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurological illness after Alzheimer's disease. According to research, medication alone can give palliative alleviation; however, freezing of gait (FOG) and balance can be treated with physical therapy. This meta-analysis aims to bridge gaps about exercise-based therapy's impact on balance and FOG in patients with PD. Google Scholar, CINHAL, Medline, PubMed, and PEDro were searched for 2016-2021 citations using the PIOD paradigm. Pooled effect size mean and SD were analysed using a fixed and random effects model. A total of 21 trials were included in this review, with SMD=0.60 and p=0.0007 utilising BBS. The pooled analysis revealed statistically significant impacts on exercise-based management in the experimental group. With SMD=0.87 and p<0.00001 using Mini-BESTest, the pooled analysis revealed that exercise-based management was also effective on balance in the experimental group. The fixed effect model of FOG in terms of SMD was used to draw the pooled effects of FOG in terms of SMD and FOG in terms of SMD (0.21; 95 percent CI -0.01 to 0.44; p=0.06). According to this research, several physiotherapy approaches such as exergaming, gamepad systems, virtual reality, gait exercises, and core training, help Parkinson's patients regain balance and FOG.

[Modern achievements in the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma].,"Glaucoma is one of the most difficult and significant ocular conditions. The chronic asymptomatic course of glaucoma progression leads to irreversible deterioration of visual functions. Many aspects of its pathogenesis, the features of its clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment have been identified in recent years. The results of diagnostic methods: tonometry, perimetry, optical coherence tomography - with glaucoma do not have high specificity due to the large diversity of the population. When determining the target intraocular pressure (IOP), we look at the indicators of the choroidal blood flow and biomechanical stress of the cornea and sclera (fibrous membrane of the eye). Studying visual functions is important in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma. The creation of a modern portable device based on a virtual reality helmet allows examination of patients with low central vision. Structural changes in glaucoma affect the optic disc and the inner retinal layers. The proposed classification of atypical discs allows determining the earliest characteristic changes in the neuroretinal rim for glaucoma in cases of difficult diagnosis. The complexity of the diagnosis of glaucoma is also associated with concomitant pathologies in elderly patients. In cases with comorbidity of primary glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease the structural and functional changes revealed by modern research methods for glaucoma are explained by both the process of secondary transsynaptic degeneration and the death of neurons as a result of an increased IOP. The starting treatment is and its type are fundamentally important for preserving visual functions. Drug therapy with prostaglandin analogues contributes to a significant and persistent decrease in the level of IOP, and mainly by utilizing the uveoscleral outflow pathway. Surgical treatment of glaucoma is an effective way to achieve the target IOP values. However, postoperative hypotension affects the bloodstream both in the central and peripapillary retina. Optical coherence tomography angiography helped establishe that the strongest factor that determines postoperative changes is the difference in IOP, not its absolute level.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; analogues of prostaglandins; glaucoma; glaucoma surgery; intraocular pressure; optical coherence tomography; perimetry; target pressure,"Humans; Aged; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Glaucoma; Optic Disk; Intraocular Pressure; Visual Field Tests; Tomography, Optical Coherence","Avetisov, SE; Erichev, VP; Antonov, AA; Poleva, RP; Kozlova, IV; Makarova, AS"
A systematic review: Virtual-reality-based techniques for human exercises and health improvement.,"Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a new safe and efficient tool for the rehabilitation of many childhood and adulthood illnesses. VR-based therapies have the potential to improve both motor and functional skills in a wide range of age groups through cortical reorganization and the activation of various neuronal connections. Recently, the potential for using serious VR-based games that combine perceptual learning and dichoptic stimulation has been explored for the rehabilitation of ophthalmological and neurological disorders. In ophthalmology, several clinical studies have demonstrated the ability to use VR training to enhance stereopsis, contrast sensitivity, and visual acuity. The use of VR technology provides a significant advantage in training each eye individually without requiring occlusion or penalty. In neurological disorders, the majority of patients undergo recurrent episodes (relapses) of neurological impairment, however, in a few cases (60-80%), the illness progresses over time and becomes chronic, consequential in cumulated motor disability and cognitive deficits. Current research on memory restoration has been spurred by theories about brain plasticity and findings concerning the nervous system's capacity to reconstruct cellular synapses as a result of interaction with enriched environments. Therefore, the use of VR training can play an important role in the improvement of cognitive function and motor disability. Although there are several reviews in the community employing relevant Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, VR has not yet been thoroughly examined in this regard. In this systematic review, we examine the key ideas of VR-based training for prevention and control measurements in ocular diseases such as Myopia, Amblyopia, Presbyopia, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Epilepsy and Autism spectrum disorder. This review highlights the fundamentals of VR technologies regarding their clinical research in healthcare. Moreover, these findings will raise community awareness of using VR training and help researchers to learn new techniques to prevent and cure different diseases. We further discuss the current challenges of using VR devices, as well as the future prospects of human training.",2023,Alzheimer; age-related macular degeneration; amblyopia; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; myopia; presbyopia; virtual reality,Humans; Child; Artificial Intelligence; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Disabled Persons; Motor Disorders; Virtual Reality; Nervous System Diseases,"Ali, SG; Wang, X; Li, P; Jung, Y; Bi, L; Kim, J; Chen, Y; Feng, DD; Magnenat Thalmann, N; Wang, J; Sheng, B"

[Visualization of the functional neural circuit breakdown process in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and application to the development of new therapies].,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients cause cognitive impairment in time and space as early symptoms, in which the hippocampus plays an essential role. In the hippocampus, place cells play an important role in processing spatial information. The hippocampus recognizes space and guides creatures to their destinations using these place cells. In AD patients, the hippocampal neuronal network that place cells form could malfunction with age. However, it has remained unknown how the disruption of the neural circuits progresses at a single-cell resolution in AD. Conventional methods such as electrophysiology experiments could only record the same cells in the hippocampal neural circuit of awake mice for a few days. To clear the detail of neuronal circuit disruption in AD, it is necessary to observe brains of the same individuals over several months. Therefore, we performed chronic two-photon calcium imaging using AD model mice expressing the fluorescent calcium sensor protein G-CaMP7 to monitor spatiotemporal representation in a virtual reality environment. The activity of hundreds of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was detected over months from the same neuronal populations. In AD mice, amyloid (Aβ) plaque-like aggregates in the stratum oriens layer of hippocampal CA1 start to develop at 2.5 months of age, increase in both number and size with age, and neurons with hyperactivity increase near Aβ plaque-like aggregates. In addition, place cells observed during VR navigation showed abnormalities in the stability of activity within the place field at 4 months old, and then the stability was further deteriorated and the number of place cells decreased at 7 months old. Thus, we demonstrated that the activity patterns of various neurons, including place cells, in the neural circuitry of the hippocampal CA1 region in AD have different failure modes, and this finding is expected to be applied to the effective drug evaluation for AD.",2023,,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Calcium; Neurons; Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus","Mizuta, K"

Affective Out-World Experience via Virtual Reality for Older Adults Living with Mild Cognitive Impairments or Mild Dementia.,"Older adults with cognitive impairments may face barriers to accessing experiences beyond their physical premises. Previous research has suggested that missing out on emotional experiences may affect mental health and impact cognitive abilities. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions to improve the health-related quality of life of older adults. With virtual reality offering endless opportunities for health support, we must consider how virtual reality can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences to older adults to enhance their emotional regulation. Thirty older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia participated in the study. Affect and emotional behavior were measured. The usability and the sense of presence were also assessed. Finally, we assessed the virtual reality experiences based on physiological responses and eye-tracking data. The results indicated that virtual reality can positively enhance the mental health of this population by eliciting a positive affective state and enhancing their emotional regulation.

Path integration selectively predicts midlife risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the first cortical region to exhibit neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with EC grid cell dysfunction. Given the role of grid cells in path integration, we predicted that path integration impairment would represent the first behavioural change in adults at-risk of AD. Using immersive virtual reality, we found that midlife path integration impairments predicted both hereditary and physiological AD risk, with no corresponding impairment on tests of episodic memory or other spatial behaviours. Impairments related to poorer angular estimation and were associated with hexadirectional grid-like fMRI signal in the posterior-medial EC.

An Intervention on Anxiety Symptoms in Moderate Alzheimer's Disease through Virtual Reality: A Feasibility Study and Lessons Learned.,"(1) Background: Although cognitive impairment is considered the core deficit of dementia, anxiety disorders also have a negative influence on the social and daily life of the affected population. We have explored the exposure of relaxing scenarios in immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) as an intervention strategy for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease. (2) Methods: Three participants were recruited from a day center to participate in a five-week study, which included a Pre- and Post-evaluation with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the anxiety subdomain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Participants' heart rate, oxygen saturation, arterial pressure, and respiratory rate were also monitored during intervention sessions. Three virtual scenarios from Nature Treks VR were used as the intervention over three weeks (a total of nine sessions). (3) Results: Post-intervention anxiety assessment showed a light reduction in psychological anxiety in the HARS questionnaire. A light reduction in heart rate was also observed during the exposure to iVR. (4) Discussion: The use of virtual scenarios was a satisfactory experience for all the participants.

Digital Intervention For The Management Of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial, chronic, neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence and limited therapeutic options, making it a global health crisis. Being the most common cause of dementia, AD erodes the cognitive, functional, and social abilities of the individual and causes escalating medical and psychosocial needs. As yet, this disorder has no cure and current treatment options are palliative in nature. There is an urgent need for novel therapy to address this pressing challenge. Digital therapeutics (Dtx) is one such novel therapy that is gaining popularity globally. Dtx provides evidence based therapeutic interventions driven by internet and software, employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames, apps, sensors, virtual reality aiding in the prevention, management, and treatment of ailments like neurological abnormalities and chronic diseases. Dtx acts as a supportive tool for the optimization of patient care, individualized treatment and improved health outcomes. Dtx uses visual, sound and other non-invasive approaches for instance-consistent therapy, reminiscence therapy, computerised cognitive training, semantic and phonological assistance devices, wearables and computer-assisted rehabilitation environment to find applications in Alzheimer's disease for improving memory, cognition, functional abilities and managing motor symptom. A few of the Dtx-based tools employed in AD include ""Memory Matters"", ""AlzSense"", ""Alzheimer Assistant"", ""smart robotic dog"", ""Immersive virtual reality (iVR)"" and the most current gamma stimulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current trends in digital health in AD and explore the benefits, challenges, and impediments of using Dtx as an adjunctive therapy for the management of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Dementia; Digital health.; Internet of things; Mobile apps; Reminiscence therapy,,"Manchanda, N; Aggarwal, A; Setya, S; Talegaonkar, S"
Spatial memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease and their connection to cognitive maps' formation by place cells and grid cells.,"Whenever we navigate through different contexts, we build a cognitive map: an internal representation of the territory. Spatial navigation is a complex skill that involves multiple types of information processing and integration. Place cells and grid cells, collectively with other hippocampal and medial entorhinal cortex neurons (MEC), form a neural network whose activity is critical for the representation of self-position and orientation along with spatial memory retrieval. Furthermore, this activity generates new representations adapting to changes in the environment. Though there is a normal decline in spatial memory related to aging, this is dramatically increased in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a multi-factorial neurodegenerative disorder affecting mainly the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex (HP-EC) circuit. Consequently, the initial stages of the disease have disorientation and wandering behavior as two of its hallmarks. Recent electrophysiological studies have linked spatial memory deficits to difficulties in spatial information encoding. Here we will discuss map impairment and remapping disruption in the HP-EC network, as a possible circuit mechanism involved in the spatial memory and navigation deficits observed in AD, pointing out the benefits of virtual reality as a tool for early diagnosis and rehabilitation.",2022,Alzheimer’s disease; cognitive map; entorhinal cortex; hippocampus; navigation; remapping,,"Silva, A; Martínez, MC"
"Leveraging Computational Intelligence Techniques for Diagnosing Degenerative Nerve Diseases: A Comprehensive Review, Open Challenges, and Future Research Directions.","Degenerative nerve diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases have always been a global issue of concern. Approximately 1/6th of the world's population suffers from these disorders, yet there are no definitive solutions to cure these diseases after the symptoms set in. The best way to treat these disorders is to detect them at an earlier stage. Many of these diseases are genetic; this enables machine learning algorithms to give inferences based on the patient's medical records and history. Machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks are also critical for the early identification of degenerative nerve diseases. The significant applications of machine learning and deep learning in early diagnosis and establishing potential therapies for degenerative nerve diseases have motivated us to work on this review paper. Through this review, we covered various machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their application in the diagnosis of degenerative nerve diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we also included the recent advancements in each of these models, which improved their capabilities for classifying degenerative nerve diseases. The limitations of each of these methods are also discussed.

Second-year medical students (n = 150) completed a pre-survey, Embodied Labs, Inc. Beatriz Lab VR module, and a post-survey. Most students knew someone with dementia (72%), were a family member of someone with dementia (52%) or had worked with a patient (61%) with dementia. Using paired survey questions, students reported significant increases in understanding how their lives would be affected by dementia (71% vs. 94%) and the needs of a person with dementia (64% vs. 95%) after VR. They reported increased understanding of being a caregiver of someone with dementia (24% vs. 81%) and the impact it can have on the entire family (64% vs. 97%). Overall students agreed this simulation made them think about their approach to clinical skills (94%) and should be utilized more in the curriculum (76%). This pilot study indicated that this VR experience can be used to advance understanding of a person's experiences with dementia and that integrating VR into the medical curricula should be considered.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; embodiment; empathy; simulation; virtual reality,"Humans; Students, Medical; Pilot Projects; Geriatrics; Alzheimer Disease; Virtual Reality","Bard, JT; Chung, HK; Shaia, JK; Wellman, LL; Elzie, CA"
Preparing future health care workers for interactions with people with dementia: A mixed methods study.,"Strategies used in training future health professionals have expanded from traditional methods to a variety of approaches, including sensitivity training. Students who receive disease-specific sensitivity training are more compassionate to patients. Alzheimer's disease (AD) sensitivity training includes deficit-focused dementia tours that physically alter sensations. This embedded-experimental (between-subjects) variant mixed-methods study assessed the effectiveness of virtual reality as a delivery format for dementia tours compared to dementia tours that physically alter sensations. It also compared the effectiveness of deficit-focused dementia sensitivity training to reading strengths-focused case studies, a traditional instruction method. Forty-one university students were randomized into one of three conditions. All participants completed pre- and post-assessments and were interviewed. Quantitative results indicate that a dementia tour offered through virtual reality is as effective as a physical-based tour; however, compared to reading case studies, participants reported poorer attitudes about living with AD and feeling less prepared for caregiving. The qualitative results show an increase in empathy across all conditions. Integration of findings indicates that dementia tours in both formats are effective at encouraging empathy and that both strengths-based and deficit-based sensitivity training are important components of education for future health care workers.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; empathy; health care; virtual reality,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Dementia; Empathy; Geriatrics; Health Personnel,"Torrence, C; Bhanu, A; Bertrand, J; Dye, C; Truong, K; Madathil, KC"
Using second life to teach health professions students about Alzheimer's Disease: A comprehensive review.,"Increased training is necessary to ensure that the next generation of health care professionals are prepared to effectively and compassionately serve patients with Alzheimer's Disease. Second Life® is a virtual world shown to provide a safe, convenient, and effective environment for teaching health-related content. To date, there has been no comprehensive review of studies using Second Life in education about Alzheimer's Disease. The authors conducted a scoping review of the literature on the use of Second Life in the education of medical, nursing, and health professions students about Alzheimer's Disease. Searches were conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL. Thirty-two studies containing outcomes of the application of virtual reality and the virtual world Second Life were identified. Studies were classified using the Kirkpatrick Four-Level Training Evaluation Model. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and confidence (Level 2), were most commonly reported, followed by positive reactions (Level 1). No studies identified system-level results and few examined changes in behavior. While results indicate positive student reactions and enhanced learning from Second Life interventions related to Alzheimer's Disease, they also highlight a need for future research examining outcomes at the higher Kirkpatrick levels.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Health professions education; second life,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Clinical Competence; Geriatrics; Students, Health Occupations; Health Personnel","Barros Una, L; Brangman, S; Indelicato, A; Krueger, A; Ludwig, A; Slutzky, AR; Stewart, T; Germain, LJ"
