Unveiling the sound of the cognitive status: Machine Learning-based speech analysis in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.,"Advancement in screening tools accessible to the general population for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prediction of its progression is essential for achieving timely therapeutic interventions and conducting decentralized clinical trials. This study delves into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques by leveraging paralinguistic features extracted directly from a brief spontaneous speech (SS) protocol. We aimed to explore the capability of ML techniques to discriminate between different degrees of cognitive impairment based on SS. Furthermore, for the first time, this study investigates the relationship between paralinguistic features from SS and cognitive function within the AD spectrum.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Automated pattern recognition; Early diagnosis; Machine Learning; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuropsychological tests; Speech acoustics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Machine Learning; Disease Progression,"García-Gutiérrez, F; Alegret, M; Marquié, M; Muñoz, N; Ortega, G; Cano, A; De Rojas, I; García-González, P; Olivé, C; Puerta, R; García-Sanchez, A; Capdevila-Bayo, M; Montrreal, L; Pytel, V; Rosende-Roca, M; Zaldua, C; Gabirondo, P; Tárraga, L; Ruiz, A; Boada, M; Valero, S"

Harnessing acoustic speech parameters to decipher amyloid status in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive functions. Currently, there are no effective treatments for AD, underscoring the importance of identifying individuals in the preclinical stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to enable early interventions. Among the neuropathological events associated with the onset of the disease is the accumulation of amyloid protein in the brain, which correlates with decreased levels of A",2023,Alzheimer's disease; automated pattern recognition; biomarkers; cerebrospinal fluid; early diagnosis; machine learning; mild cognitive impairment; speech acoustics,,"García-Gutiérrez, F; Marquié, M; Muñoz, N; Alegret, M; Cano, A; de Rojas, I; García-González, P; Olivé, C; Puerta, R; Orellana, A; Montrreal, L; Pytel, V; Ricciardi, M; Zaldua, C; Gabirondo, P; Hinzen, W; Lleonart, N; García-Sánchez, A; Tárraga, L; Ruiz, A; Boada, M; Valero, S"
