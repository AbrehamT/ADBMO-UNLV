Associations of Physical Activity and Heart Rate Variability from a Two-Week ECG Monitor with Cognitive Function and Dementia: The ARIC Neurocognitive Study.,"Low physical activity (PA) measured by accelerometers and low heart rate variability (HRV) measured from short-term ECG recordings are associated with worse cognitive function. Wearable long-term ECG monitors are now widely used, and some devices also include an accelerometer. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether PA or HRV measured from long-term ECG monitors was associated with cognitive function among older adults. A total of 1590 ARIC participants had free-living PA and HRV measured over 14 days using the Zio",2024,ECG; accelerometry; dementia; digital health; heart rate variability; physical activity; remote monitoring,"Humans; Heart Rate; Female; Dementia; Aged; Male; Cognition; Exercise; Electrocardiography; Aged, 80 and over; Cognitive Dysfunction; Wearable Electronic Devices; Cross-Sectional Studies; Accelerometry","Marino, FR; Wu, HT; Etzkorn, L; Rooney, MR; Soliman, EZ; Deal, JA; Crainiceanu, C; Spira, AP; Wanigatunga, AA; Schrack, JA; Chen, LY"

"Old age alters inflammation and autophagy signaling in the brain, leading to exacerbated neurological outcomes after spinal cord injury in male mice.","Older patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) have different features with regard to neurological characteristics after injury. Recent large-scale longitudinal population-based studies showed that individuals with SCI are at a higher risk of developing dementia than non-SCI patients, indicating that SCI is a potential risk factor for dementia. Aging is known to potentiate inflammation and neurodegeneration at the injured site leading to impaired recovery from SCI. However, no research has been aimed at studying the mechanisms of SCI-mediated cognitive impairment in the elderly. The present study examined neurobehavioral and molecular changes in the brain and the underlying mechanisms associated with brain dysfunction in aged C57BL/6 male mice using a contusion SCI model. At 2 months post-injury, aged mice displayed worse performance in locomotor, cognitive and depressive-like behavioral tests compared to young adult animals. Histopathology in injured spinal cord tissue was exacerbated in aged SCI mice. In the brain, transcriptomic analysis with NanoString neuropathology panel identified activated microglia and dysregulated autophagy as the most significantly altered pathways by both age and injury. These findings were further validated by flow cytometry, which demonstrated increased myeloid and lymphocytes infiltration at both the injured site and brain of aged mice. Moreover, SCI in aged mice altered microglial function and dysregulated autophagy in microglia, resulting in worsened neurodegeneration. Taken together, our data indicate that old age exacerbates neuropathological changes in both the injured spinal cord and remote brain regions leading to poorer functional outcomes, at least in part, through altered inflammation and autophagy function.",2024,Autophagy; Brain; Neuroinflammation; Old age; Spinal cord injury,,"Lei, Z; Ritzel, RM; Li, Y; Li, H; Faden, AI; Wu, J"

The Daily Experiences of Hispanic and Latinx Dementia Caregivers Study: Protocol for a Fully Remote Daily Diary Observational Cohort Study.,"The Hispanic and Latinx community is disproportionately affected by Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs). In the United States, approximately 8.5 million caregivers of individuals with ADRDs identify as Hispanic and Latinx people, and caregiving-related stress and burden place caregivers at elevated risk for poor mental health outcomes, as well as loneliness and social isolation. To date, there is limited knowledge about the daily stress experiences of Hispanic and Latinx caregivers. Given this knowledge gap, it is critical to examine how personal, cultural, and contextual factors influence daily stress, mental health, and resilience over time among Hispanic and Latinx ADRD caregivers.",2024,Alzheimer; Alzheimer’s disease; Hispanic; Latinx; burden; caregivers; cohort; daily diary; dementia; loneliness; longitudinal; mental health; observational cohort study; protocol; stress; well-being,"Humans; Hispanic or Latino; Caregivers; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Female; Male; Stress, Psychological; Middle Aged; Aged; United States; Adult; Diaries as Topic","Mildrum Chana, S; Álvarez, L; Poe, A; Bibriescas, N; Wang, DH; DiFiglia, S; Azuero, A; Crowe, M; Puga, F"

Cognitive-Cognitive Dual-task in aging: A cross-sectional online study.,"The prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly dementia, is on the rise across many countries worldwide. This negative trend calls for improving our understanding of cognitive aging. While motor-cognitive dual-task approaches have already been proven valuable for clinical diagnosis, comparatively less research is available on the application of Cognitive-Cognitive Dual-Tasking (CCDT), across several cognitive domains. Moreover, there is limited understanding about how healthy aging affects performance in such dual-tasks in the general population. CCDT entails engaging individuals in multiple cognitive tasks simultaneously and holds promise for remote e-Health interventions. In this cross-sectional study, our objective was to evaluate the suitability of a newly developed, self-administered, online tool for examining age-related differences in memory performance under dual-tasking. 337 healthy adults aged 50-90 underwent a visual memory test (Memo) under both single and dual-task conditions (attend to auditory letters). Additional measures included questionnaires on subjective memory complaints (MAC-Q), on cognitive reserve (CR), and a cognitive screening (auto-GEMS). As expected, the accuracy of visual memory performance exhibited a negative correlation with age and MAC-Q, and a positive correlation with CR and auto-GEMS scores. Dual-tasking significantly impaired performance, and its detrimental effect decreased with increasing age. Furthermore, the protective effect of cognitive reserve diminished with advancing age. These findings suggest that the commonly observed age-related increase in dual-task costs is not universally applicable across all tasks and cognitive domains. With further refinement, a longitudinal implementation of this approach may assist in identifying individuals with a distinct cognitive trajectory and potentially at a higher risk of developing cognitive decline.",2024,,"Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Cognition; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory; Cognitive Reserve; Cognitive Aging","Contemori, G; Saccani, MS; Bonato, M"

Subcortical tau is linked to hypoperfusion in connected cortical regions in 4-repeat tauopathies.,"Four-repeat (4R) tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by cerebral accumulation of 4R tau pathology. The most prominent 4R tauopathies are progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration characterized by subcortical tau accumulation and cortical neuronal dysfunction, as shown by PET-assessed hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism. Yet, there is a spatial mismatch between subcortical tau deposition patterns and cortical neuronal dysfunction, and it is unclear how these two pathological brain changes are interrelated. Here, we hypothesized that subcortical tau pathology induces remote neuronal dysfunction in functionally connected cortical regions to test a pathophysiological model that mechanistically links subcortical tau accumulation to cortical neuronal dysfunction in 4R tauopathies. We included 51 Aβ-negative patients with clinically diagnosed PSP variants (n = 26) or corticobasal syndrome (n = 25) who underwent structural MRI and 18F-PI-2620 tau-PET. 18F-PI-2620 tau-PET was recorded using a dynamic one-stop-shop acquisition protocol to determine an early 0.5-2.5 min post tracer-injection perfusion window for assessing cortical neuronal dysfunction, as well as a 20-40 min post tracer-injection window to determine 4R-tau load. Perfusion-PET (i.e. early window) was assessed in 200 cortical regions, and tau-PET was assessed in 32 subcortical regions of established functional brain atlases. We determined tau epicentres as subcortical regions with the highest 18F-PI-2620 tau-PET signal and assessed the connectivity of tau epicentres to cortical regions of interest using a resting-state functional MRI-based functional connectivity template derived from 69 healthy elderly controls from the ADNI cohort. Using linear regression, we assessed whether: (i) higher subcortical tau-PET was associated with reduced cortical perfusion; and (ii) cortical perfusion reductions were observed preferentially in regions closely connected to subcortical tau epicentres. As hypothesized, higher subcortical tau-PET was associated with overall lower cortical perfusion, which remained consistent when controlling for cortical tau-PET. Using group-average and subject-level PET data, we found that the seed-based connectivity pattern of subcortical tau epicentres aligned with cortical perfusion patterns, where cortical regions that were more closely connected to the tau epicentre showed lower perfusion. Together, subcortical tau-accumulation is associated with remote perfusion reductions indicative of neuronal dysfunction in functionally connected cortical regions in 4R-tauopathies. This suggests that subcortical tau pathology may induce cortical dysfunction, which may contribute to clinical disease manifestation and clinical heterogeneity.",2024,4R-tauopathies; CBD; PI-2620 tau-PET; PSP; functional connectivity; perfusion-PET,"Humans; Male; Female; Positron-Emission Tomography; Aged; Tauopathies; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Cerebral Cortex; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Roemer, SN; Brendel, M; Gnörich, J; Malpetti, M; Zaganjori, M; Quattrone, A; Gross, M; Steward, A; Dewenter, A; Wagner, F; Dehsarvi, A; Ferschmann, C; Wall, S; Palleis, C; Rauchmann, BS; Katzdobler, S; Jäck, A; Stockbauer, A; Fietzek, UM; Bernhardt, AM; Weidinger, E; Zwergal, A; Stöcklein, S; Perneczky, R; Barthel, H; Sabri, O; Levin, J; Höglinger, GU; Franzmeier, N"

Photobiomodulation in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease: state-of-the-art and translational perspectives.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant public health problem, affecting millions of people across the world.

In this review, we discuss the potential of photobiomodulation (PBM) for preventing and alleviating AD-associated pathologies, with a focus on the biological mechanisms underlying this therapy. Future research directions and guidance for clinical practice for this non-invasive and non-pharmacological therapy are also highlighted. The available evidence indicates that different treatment paradigms, including transcranial and systemic PBM, along with the recently proposed remote PBM, all could be promising for AD. PBM exerts diverse biological effects, such as enhancing mitochondrial function, mitigating the neuroinflammation caused by activated glial cells, increasing cerebral perfusion, improving glymphatic drainage, regulating the gut microbiome, boosting myokine production, and modulating the immune system. We suggest that PBM may serve as a powerful therapeutic intervention for AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Experimental models; Neurodegeneration; Photobiomodulation (PBM); Therapy,"Alzheimer Disease; Low-Level Light Therapy; Animals; Humans; Disease Models, Animal; Translational Research, Biomedical","Huang, Z; Hamblin, MR; Zhang, Q"

Immunomodulatory approaches will be most effective with precise manipulation of discrete myeloid cell phenotypes in time and space. Here, we investigate how stroke alters mononuclear myeloid cell composition and phenotypes at single-cell resolution and key spatial patterns. Our results show that multiple reactive microglial states and monocyte-derived populations contribute to an extensive myeloid cell repertoire in post-stroke brains. We identify important overlaps and distinctions among different cell types/states that involve ontogeny- and spatial-related properties. Notably, brain connectivity with infarcted tissue underpins the pattern of local and remote altered cell accumulation and reactivity.

Single episode of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury leads to chronic neurological deficits and Alzheimer's-like pathological dementia.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the foremost causes of disability and mortality globally. While the scientific and medical emphasis is to save lives and avoid disability during acute period of injury, a severe health problem can manifest years after injury. For instance, TBI increases the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Remote TBI history was reported to be a cause of the accelerated clinical trajectory of Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD) resulting in earlier onset of cognitive impairment and increased AD-associated pathological markers like greater amyloid deposition and cortical thinning. It is not well understood whether a single TBI event may increase the risk of dementia. Moreover, the cellular signaling pathways remain elusive for the chronic effects of TBI on cognition. We have hypothesized that a single TBI induces sustained neuroinflammation and disrupts cellular communication in a way that results later in ADRD pathology. To test this, we induced TBI in young adult CD1 mice and assessed the behavioral outcomes after 11 months followed by pathological, histological, transcriptomic, and MRI assessment. On MRI scans, these mice showed significant loss of tissue, reduced CBF, and higher white matter injury compared to sham mice. We found these brains showed progressive atrophy, markers of ADRD, sustained astrogliosis, loss of neuronal plasticity, and growth factors even after 1-year post-TBI. Because of progressive neurodegeneration, these mice had motor deficits, showed cognitive impairments, and wandered randomly in open field. We, therefore, conclude that progressive pathology after adulthood TBI leads to neurodegenerative conditions such as ADRD and impairs neuronal functions.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (ADRD); Cognitive impairment; Neuropathology; Synapse; TBI; White matter injury,,"Vaibhav, K; Gulhane, M; Ahluwalia, P; Kumar, M; Ahluwalia, M; Rafiq, AM; Amble, V; Zabala, MG; Miller, JB; Goldman, L; Mondal, AK; Deak, F; Kolhe, R; Arbab, AS; Vale, FL"

Both physical capacity and physical activity are currently measured in the clinic using standardized questionnaires and tests, such as the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). However, relying only on in-clinic tests is suboptimal since they offer limited information on how a person functions in daily life and how functioning fluctuates throughout the day.

Systemic inflammation in Aβ,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by memory impairment, neuronal death, and synaptic loss in the hippocampus. Sporadic late-onset AD, which accounts for over 95 % of disease cases, is a multifactorial pathology with complex etiology and pathogenesis. Nowadays, neuroinflammation is considered the third most important component of AD pathogenesis in addition to amyloid peptide generation and deposition. Neuroinflammation is associated with the impairment of blood-brain barrier and leakage of inflammatory mediators into the periphery with developing systemic inflammatory responses. Systemic inflammation is currently considered one of the therapeutic targets for AD treatment, that necessitates in-depth study of this phenomenon in appropriate non-transgenic animal models. This study was aimed to explore systemic inflammatory manifestations in rats with Aβ",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Anemia of inflammation; Circulating phagocytes; Cognitive flexibility; Spatial memory; Systemic inflammation,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Models, Animal; Inflammation; Male; Peptide Fragments; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Spatial Memory; Neuroinflammatory Diseases","Nefodova, A; Rudyk, M; Dovhyi, R; Dovbynchuk, T; Dzubenko, N; Tolstanova, G; Skivka, L"

Healthcare Awareness Profile Interview: Development of a new evidence-based brief clinical tool to assess awareness in people with dementia.,"People with dementia vary in awareness of difficulties. Evaluating awareness could facilitate personalized care. However, current research measures are unsuitable for practical clinical application. We aimed to develop a brief multidimensional awareness interview for clinical use. Informed by available evidence about awareness of dementia, items suitable for both in-person and remote administration were modified from validated measures or developed for clinical application. The interview was administered via telephone or videoconference to 31 community-dwelling people with mild-to-moderate dementia. An informant completed a corresponding questionnaire. A multidimensional profile of awareness was created using self-report of symptoms, and discrepancies between self-rating and either informant rating or objective memory task performance. Feedback from participants and informants and discussions with clinical advisory and patient and public involvement groups helped finalize the interview. Remote administration was straightforward taking on average under 11 min. Awareness profiles showed a spectrum of awareness across domains. Feedback indicated that the items were acceptable and understandable. Certain aspects could be mildly upsetting where current difficulties were highlighted.

Open Meter Duo: Low-Cost Instrument for Fluorimetric Determination of Cholinesterase Activity.,"Environmental screening is essential due to the increased occurrence of harmful substances in the environment. Open Meter Duo (OMD) is an open-source field photo/fluorimeter that uses an RGB diode that imitates a color according to the selected wavelength and uses a UV LED from the security kit diode as an excitation light source. The prepared PCB shield with a 3D-printed aperture was connected to Arduino UNO R4 WiFi. This system was used for the fluorescent detection of cholinesterase activity with the indoxyl acetate method. Carbofuran-a toxic pesticide-and donepezil-a drug used to treat Alzheimer's disease-were tested as model inhibitors of cholinesterase activity. The limit of detection of indoxyl acetate was 11.6 μmol/L, and the IC50 values of the inhibitors were evaluated. This system is optimized for wireless use in field analysis with added cloud support and power source. The time of analysis was 5 min for the fluorimetric assay and 20 min for the optional photometric assay. The time of field operation was approximately 4 h of continuous measurement. This system is ready to be used as a cheap and easy control platform for portable use in drug control and point-of-care testing.",2024,3D printing; Arduino; cholinesterase; fluorimetry; low cost; portable; remote sensing,Humans; Fluorometry; Donepezil; Alzheimer Disease; Cholinesterases; Cholinesterase Inhibitors,"Keresteš, O; Mozo, JD; Pohanka, M"

A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"

Pulmonary Hypertension: Intensification and Personalization of Combination Rx (PHoenix): A phase IV randomized trial for the evaluation of dose-response and clinical efficacy of riociguat and selexipag using implanted technologies.,"Approved therapies for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) mediate pulmonary vascular vasodilatation by targeting distinct biological pathways. International guidelines recommend that patients with an inadequate response to dual therapy with a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) and endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), are recommended to either intensify oral therapy by adding a selective prostacyclin receptor (IP) agonist (selexipag), or switching from PDE5i to a soluble guanylate-cyclase stimulator (sGCS; riociguat). The clinical equipoise between these therapeutic choices provides the opportunity for evaluation of individualized therapeutic effects. Traditionally, invasive/hospital-based investigations are required to comprehensively assess disease severity and demonstrate treatment benefits. Regulatory-approved, minimally invasive monitors enable equivalent measurements to be obtained while patients are at home. In this 2 × 2 randomized crossover trial, patients with PAH established on guideline-recommended dual therapy and implanted with CardioMEMS™ (a wireless pulmonary artery sensor) and ConfirmRx™ (an insertable cardiac rhythm monitor), will receive ERA + sGCS, or PDEi + ERA + IP agonist. The study will evaluate clinical efficacy via established clinical investigations and remote monitoring technologies, with remote data relayed through regulatory-approved online clinical portals. The primary aim will be the change in right ventricular systolic volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from baseline to maximal tolerated dose with each therapy. Using data from MRI and other outcomes, including hemodynamics, physical activity, physiological measurements, quality of life, and side effect reporting, we will determine whether remote technology facilitates early evaluation of clinical efficacy, and investigate intra-patient efficacy of the two treatment approaches.",2024,oral prostacyclin‐receptor agonist; remote monitoring; soluble guanylate‐cyclase stimulator; targeted therapy,,"Varian, F; Dick, J; Battersby, C; Roman, S; Ablott, J; Watson, L; Binmahfooz, S; Zafar, H; Colgan, G; Cannon, J; Suntharalingam, J; Lordan, J; Howard, L; McCabe, C; Wort, J; Price, L; Church, C; Hamilton, N; Armstrong, I; Hameed, A; Hurdman, J; Elliot, C; Condliffe, R; Wilkins, M; Webb, A; Adlam, D; Benza, RL; Rahimi, K; Shojaei-Shahrokhabadi, M; Lin, NX; Wason, JMS; McIntosh, A; McConnachie, A; Middleton, JT; Thompson, R; Kiely, DG; Toshner, M; Rothman, A"

Machine Learning and Digital Biomarkers Can Detect Early Stages of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are devastating conditions that can develop without noticeable symptoms, causing irreversible damage to neurons before any signs become clinically evident. NDs are a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Currently, there are no cures or treatments to halt their progression. Therefore, the development of early detection methods is urgently needed to delay neuronal loss as soon as possible. Despite advancements in Medtech, the early diagnosis of NDs remains a challenge at the intersection of medical, IT, and regulatory fields. Thus, this review explores ""digital biomarkers"" (tools designed for remote neurocognitive data collection and AI analysis) as a potential solution. The review summarizes that recent studies combining AI with digital biomarkers suggest the possibility of identifying pre-symptomatic indicators of NDs. For instance, research utilizing convolutional neural networks for eye tracking has achieved significant diagnostic accuracies. ROC-AUC scores reached up to 0.88, indicating high model performance in differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls. Similarly, advancements in facial expression analysis through tools have demonstrated significant potential in detecting emotional changes in ND patients, with some models reaching an accuracy of 0.89 and a precision of 0.85. This review follows a structured approach to article selection, starting with a comprehensive database search and culminating in a rigorous quality assessment and meaning for NDs of the different methods. The process is visualized in 10 tables with 54 parameters describing different approaches and their consequences for understanding various mechanisms in ND changes. However, these methods also face challenges related to data accuracy and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this review proposes strategies that emphasize the need for rigorous validation and rapid integration into clinical practice. Such integration could transform ND diagnostics, making early detection tools more cost-effective and globally accessible. In conclusion, this review underscores the urgent need to incorporate validated digital health tools into mainstream medical practice. This integration could indicate a new era in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially altering the trajectory of these conditions for millions worldwide. Thus, by highlighting specific and statistically significant findings, this review demonstrates the current progress in this field and the potential impact of these advancements on the global management of NDs.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; digital endpoints; digital phenotyping; early detection; eye-tracking; machine learning; neurodegenerative diseases; online cognitive testing,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Biomarkers; Machine Learning,"Chudzik, A; Śledzianowski, A; Przybyszewski, AW"
Numerosity estimation of virtual humans as a digital-robotic marker for hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.,"Hallucinations are frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with dementia and higher mortality. Despite their high clinical relevance, current assessments of hallucinations are based on verbal self-reports and interviews that are limited by important biases. Here, we used virtual reality (VR), robotics, and digital online technology to quantify presence hallucination (vivid sensations that another person is nearby when no one is actually present and can neither be seen nor heard) in laboratory and home-based settings. We establish that elevated numerosity estimation of virtual human agents in VR is a digital marker for experimentally induced presence hallucinations in healthy participants, as confirmed across several control conditions and analyses. We translated the digital marker (numerosity estimation) to an online procedure that 170 PD patients carried out remotely at their homes, revealing that PD patients with disease-related presence hallucinations (but not control PD patients) showed higher numerosity estimation. Numerosity estimation enables quantitative monitoring of hallucinations, is an easy-to-use unobtrusive online method, reaching people far away from medical centers, translating neuroscientific findings using robotics and VR, to patients' homes without specific equipment or trained staff.",2024,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Hallucinations,"Albert, L; Potheegadoo, J; Herbelin, B; Bernasconi, F; Blanke, O"

Investigating the efficacy and importance of mobile-based assessments for Parkinson's disease: uncovering the potential of novel digital tests.,"This study introduces PDMotion, a mobile application comprising 11 digital tests, including those adapted from the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III and novel assessments, for remote Parkinson's Disease (PD) motor symptoms evaluation. Employing machine learning techniques on data from 50 PD patients and 29 healthy controls, PDMotion achieves accuracies of 0.878 for PD status prediction and 0.715 for severity assessment. A post-hoc explanation model is employed to assess the importance of features and tasks in diagnosis and severity evaluation. Notably, novel tasks that are not adapted from MDS-UPDRS Part III like the circle drawing, coordination test, and alternative tapping test are found to be highly important, suggesting digital assessments for PD can go beyond digitizing existing tests. The alternative tapping test emerges as the most significant task. Using its features alone achieves prediction accuracies comparable to the full task set, underscoring its potential as an independent screening tool. This study addresses a notable research gap by digitalizing a wide array of tests, including novel ones, and conducting a comparative analysis of their feature and task importance. These insights provide guidance for task selection and future development in PD mobile assessments, a field previously lacking such comparative studies.",2024,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Machine Learning; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Mobile Applications; Paracentesis,"Zhang, Y; Zeng, Z; Mirian, MS; Yen, K; Park, KW; Doo, M; Ji, J; Shen, Z; McKeown, MJ"

Speech-Based Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Research.,"Digital biomarkers are of growing interest in the field of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research. Digital biomarker data arising from digital health tools holds various potential benefits: more objective and more accurate assessment of patients' symptoms and remote collection of signals in real-world scenarios but also multimodal variance for prediction models of individual disease progression. Speech can be collected at minimal patient burden and provides rich data for assessing multiple aspects of AD pathology including cognition. However, the operations around collecting, preparing, and validly interpreting speech data within the context of clinical research on AD remains complex and sometimes challenging. Through a dedicated pipeline of speech collection tools, preprocessing steps and algorithms, precise qualification and quantification of an AD patient's pathology can be achieved from their speech. The aim of this chapter is to describe the methods that are needed to create speech collection scenarios that result in valuable speech-based digital biomarkers for clinical research.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cognition; Digital biomarkers; Speech biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech; Biomarkers; Cognition; Disease Progression,"Schäfer, S; Herrmann, J; Tovar, S; Linz, N; Tröger, J"

Wearable-Sensor-Based Weakly Supervised Parkinson's Disease Assessment with Data Augmentation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent dementia in the world. Wearable technology has been useful in the computer-aided diagnosis and long-term monitoring of PD in recent years. The fundamental issue remains how to assess the severity of PD using wearable devices in an efficient and accurate manner. However, in the real-world free-living environment, there are two difficult issues, poor annotation and class imbalance, both of which could potentially impede the automatic assessment of PD. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for assessing the severity of PD patient's in a free-living environment. Specifically, we use clustering methods to learn latent categories from the same activities, while latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models are utilized to capture latent features from multiple activities. Then, to mitigate the impact of data imbalance, we augment bag-level data while retaining key instance prototypes. To comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, we collected a dataset containing wearable-sensor signals from 83 individuals in real-life free-living conditions. The experimental results show that our framework achieves an astounding 73.48% accuracy in the fine-grained (normal, mild, moderate, severe) classification of PD severity based on hand movements. Overall, this study contributes to more accurate PD self-diagnosis in the wild, allowing doctors to provide remote drug intervention guidance.",2024,Parkinson’s disease; activity recognition; class imbalance; data augmentation; weak annotation; wearable sensor,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Movement; Wearable Electronic Devices; Severity of Illness Index; Upper Extremity,"Yue, P; Li, Z; Zhou, M; Wang, X; Yang, P"

Topographic metabolism-function relationships in Alzheimer's disease: A simultaneous PET/MRI study.,"Disruptions of neural metabolism and function occur in parallel during Alzheimer's disease (AD). While many studies have shown diverse metabolic-functional relationships in specific brain regions, much less is known about how large-scale network-level functional activity is associated with the topology of metabolism in AD. In this study, we took the advantages of simultaneous PET/MRI and multivariate analyses to investigate the associations between AD-related stereotypical spatial patterns (topographies) of glucose metabolism, measured by fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and functional connectivity, measured by resting-state functional MRI. A total of 101 participants, including 37 patients with AD, 25 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 39 cognitively normal controls, underwent PET/MRI scans and cognitive assessments. Three pairs of distinct but optimally correlated metabolic and functional topographies were identified, encompassing large-scale networks including the default-mode, executive and control, salience, attention, and subcortical networks. Importantly, the metabolic-functional associations were not only limited to one-to-one-corresponding regions, but also occur in remote and non-overlapping regions. Furthermore, both glucose metabolism and functional connectivity, as well as their linkages, exhibited various degrees of disruptions in patients with MCI and AD, and were correlated with cognitive decline. In conclusion, our results support distributed and heterogeneous topographic associations between metabolism and function, which are jeopardized by AD. Findings of this study may deepen our understanding of the pathological mechanism of AD through the perspectives of both local energy efficiency and long-term interactions between synaptic disruption and functional disconnection contributing to the clinical symptomatology in AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; brain networks; functional connectivity; glucose metabolism; metabolic-functional association; simultaneous FDG-PET/fMRI,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Glucose,"Li, W; Zhang, M; Huang, R; Hu, J; Wang, L; Ye, G; Meng, H; Lin, X; Liu, J; Li, B; Zhang, Y; Li, Y"
Remote Self-Administration of Cognitive Screeners for Older Adults Prior to a Primary Care Visit: Pilot Cross-Sectional Study of the Reliability and Usability of the MyCog Mobile Screening App.,"Routine cognitive screening is essential in the early detection of dementia, but time constraints in primary care settings often limit clinicians' ability to conduct screenings.

Remote Ischemia Postconditioning Mitigates Hippocampal Neuron Impairment by Modulating Cav1.2-CaMKIIα-Aromatase Signaling After Global Cerebral Ischemia in Ovariectomized Rats.,"Brain-derived estrogen (BDE2) is gaining attention as an endogenous neurotransmitter. Recent research has revealed that selectively removing the aromatase gene, the pivotal enzyme responsible for BDE2 synthesis, in forebrain neurons or astrocytes can lead to synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. It is worth noting that remote ischemia post-conditioning (RIP), a non-invasive technique, has been shown to activate natural protective mechanisms against severe ischemic events. The aim of our study was to investigate whether RIP triggers aromatase-BDE2 signaling, shedding light on its neuroprotective mechanisms after global cerebral ischemia (GCI) in ovariectomized rats. Our findings are as follows: (1) RIP was effective in mitigating ischemic damage in hippocampal CA1 neurons and improved cognitive function after GCI. This was partially due to increased Aro-BDE2 signaling in CA1 neurons. (2) RIP intervention efficiently enhanced pro-survival kinase pathways, such as AKT, ERK1/2, CREB, and suppressed CaMKIIα signaling in CA1 astrocytes induced by GCI. Remarkably, inhibiting CaMKIIα activity led to elevated Aro-BDE2 levels and replicated the benefits of RIP. (3) We also identified the positive mediation of Cav1.2, an LVGCC calcium channel, on CaMKIIα-Aro/BDE2 pathway response to RIP intervention. (4) Significantly, either RIP or CaMKIIα inhibition was found to alleviate reactive astrogliosis, which was accompanied by increased pro-survival A2-astrocyte protein S100A10 and decreased pro-death A1-astrocyte marker C3 levels. In summary, our study provides compelling evidence that Aro-BDE2 signaling is a critical target for the reparative effects of RIP following ischemic insult. This effect may be mediated through the CaV1.2-CaMKIIα signaling pathway, in collaboration with astrocyte-neuron interactions, thereby maintaining calcium homeostasis in the neuronal microenvironment and reducing neuronal damage after ischemia.",2024,Brain-derived estrogen; CaMKIIα; Global cerebral ischemia; Neuroprotection; Remote ischemia postconditioning,,"Wang, L; Gao, F; Chen, L; Sun, W; Liu, H; Yang, W; Zhang, X; Bai, J; Wang, R"

Digital remote monitoring for screening and early detection of urinary tract infections.,"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are one of the most prevalent bacterial infections in older adults and a significant contributor to unplanned hospital admissions in People Living with Dementia (PLWD), with early detection being crucial due to the predicament of reporting symptoms and limited help-seeking behaviour. The most common diagnostic tool is urine sample analysis, which can be time-consuming and is only employed where UTI clinical suspicion exists. In this method development and proof-of-concept study, participants living with dementia were monitored via low-cost devices in the home that passively measure activity, sleep, and nocturnal physiology. Using 27828 person-days of remote monitoring data (from 117 participants), we engineered features representing symptoms used for diagnosing a UTI. We then evaluate explainable machine learning techniques in passively calculating UTI risk and perform stratification on scores to support clinical translation and allow control over the balance between alert rate and sensitivity and specificity. The proposed UTI algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 65.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 64.3-66.2) and specificity of 70.9% (68.6-73.1) when predicting UTIs on unseen participants and after risk stratification, a sensitivity of 74.7% (67.9-81.5) and specificity of 87.9% (85.0-90.9). In addition, feature importance methods reveal that the largest contributions to the predictions were bathroom visit statistics, night-time respiratory rate, and the number of previous UTI events, aligning with the literature. Our machine learning method alerts clinicians of UTI risk in subjects, enabling earlier detection and enhanced screening when considering treatment.",2024,,,"Capstick, A; Palermo, F; Zakka, K; Fletcher-Lloyd, N; Walsh, C; Cui, T; Kouchaki, S; Jackson, R; Tran, M; Crone, M; Jensen, K; Freemont, P; Vaidyanathan, R; Kolanko, M; True, J; Daniels, S; Wingfield, D; Nilforooshan, R; Barnaghi, P"

The Huntington's Disease Gene Discovery.,"The gene for Huntington's disease (HD) was discovered in 1993, after an international collaborative initiative that led researchers to remote regions of South America. It was the most remarkable milestone, since George Huntington's initial description. Through the phenomenological discussions led by Jean-Martin Charcot and Willian Osler, and finally Americo Negrette's reports, which served as the inspiration for the Venezuela Project led by Nancy Wexler, the journey toward discovering the Huntington's disease (HD) gene was marked by substantial efforts. This monumental achievement involved the analysis of more than 18,000 blood samples and gathered dozens of researchers in an integrated effort, enabling the mapping of the gene on chromosome 4 in 1983 and leading, a decade later, to the precise localization and identification of the HTT gene. The discovery of the HD mutation represented a pivotal moment in the field of genetics and neurology, significantly enhancing our understanding of the disease and creating opportunities for future treatments. The progress made and the knowledge gained during this journey catalyzed the development of many innovative molecular techniques that have advanced research in other medical conditions. In this article, the authors celebrate three decades of this memorable event, revisiting the historical aspects, providing insights into the techniques developed, and delving into the paths that ultimately led to the discovery of the HD gene. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",2024,Huntington's disease; chorea; gene; genetics; history of medicine,Humans; Huntington Disease; Movement Disorders; Mutation; Genetic Association Studies,"Franklin, GL; Teive, HAG; Tensini, FS; Camargo, CHF; de Lima, NSC; de Dos Santos, DC; Meira, AT; Tabrizi, SJ"

Remote respiratory resistance exercise training improves respiratory function in individuals with VCP multisystem proteinopathy.,"Valosin-containing protein (VCP) disease is an autosomal dominant multisystem proteinopathy associated with hereditary inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of bone, and frontotemporal dementia. Myopathy frequently results in respiratory muscle weakness, leading to early mortality due to respiratory failure. We investigated the effects of a remotely administered inspiratory muscle training program in individuals with VCP disease. Nine adults with VCP mutation-positive familial myopathy without evidence of dementia were recruited for a 40-week remotely administered study. Baseline performance was established during the first 8 weeks, followed by 32 weeks of inspiratory muscle training. The primary outcome was maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). The secondary and exploratory endpoints included spirometry, grip strength, Inclusion Body Myopathy Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS), timed up and go, and six-minute walk test (6MWT). During the treatment phase, MIP increased significantly by a weekly mean of 0.392cm.

"Home-based, Remotely Supervised, 6-Week tDCS in Patients With Both MCI and Depression: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial.","As depressive symptom is considered a prodrome, a risk factor for progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, improving depressive symptoms should be considered a clinical priority in patients with MCI undergoing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of the home-based and remotely monitored tDCS in patients with both MCI and depression, by integrating cognitive, psychological, and electrophysiological indicators. In a 6-week, randomized, double blind, and sham-controlled study, 37 community-dwelling patients were randomly assigned to either an active or a sham stimulation group, and received 30 home-based sessions of 2 mA tDCS for 30 min with the anode located over the left and cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We measured depressive symptoms, neurocognitive function, and resting-state electroencephalography. In terms of effects of both depressive symptoms and cognitive functions, active tDCS was not significantly different from sham tDCS. However, compared to sham stimulation, active tDCS decreased and increased the activation of delta and beta frequencies, respectively. Moreover, the increase in beta activity was correlated with the cognitive enhancement only in the active group. It was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the efficacy of tDCS on depression and cognition in patients with both MCI and depression. Nevertheless, the relationship between the changes of electrophysiology and cognitive performance suggests potential neuroplasticity enhancement implicated in cognitive processes by tDCS.",2023,depression; electroencephalography (EEG); mild cognitive impairment (MCI); neuromodulation; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),,"Kim, J; Park, S; Kim, H; Roh, D; Kim, DH"

Amyloid induced hyperexcitability in default mode network drives medial temporal hyperactivity and early tau accumulation.,"In early Alzheimer's disease (AD) β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits throughout association cortex and tau appears in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Why these initially appear in disparate locations is not understood. Using task-based fMRI and multimodal PET imaging, we assess the impact of local AD pathology on network-to-network interactions. We show that AD pathologies flip interactions between the default mode network (DMN) and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) from inhibitory to excitatory. The DMN is hyperexcited with increasing levels of Aβ, which drives hyperexcitability within the MTL and this directed hyperexcitation of the MTL by the DMN predicts the rate of tau accumulation within the EC. Our results support a model whereby Aβ induces disruptions to local excitatory-inhibitory balance in the DMN, driving hyperexcitability in the MTL, leading to tau accumulation. We propose that Aβ-induced disruptions to excitatory-inhibitory balance is a candidate causal route between Aβ and remote EC-tau accumulation.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; fMRI; functional connectivity; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease; tau,Humans; tau Proteins; Default Mode Network; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Entorhinal Cortex; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography,"Giorgio, J; Adams, JN; Maass, A; Jagust, WJ; Breakspear, M"

LETHE: A Digital Intervention for Cognitive Decline.,"Dementia is the main cause of disability in elderly populations. It has been shown that the risk factors of dementia are a mixture of pathological, lifestyle and heritable factors, with some of those being provably modifiable. Early diagnosis of dementia and approaches to slow down its evolution are currently the most prominent management methodologies due to lack of a cure. For that reason, a plethora of home-based assistive technologies for dementia management do exist, with most of them focusing on the improvement of memory and thinking. The main objective of LETHE is prevention in the whole spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly population at risk reaching from asymptomatic to subjective or mild cognitive impairment to prodromal Dementia. LETHE will provide a Big Data collection platform and analysis system, that will allow prevention, personalized risk detection and intervention on cognitive decline. Through the subsequent 2-year clinical trial, the LETHE system, as well as the respective knowledge gained will be evaluated and validated. The scope of the current paper is to introduce the LETHE study and its respective novel platform as a holistic approach to multidomain lifestyle intervention trial studies. The present work depicts the architectural perspective and extends beyond state-of-the-art guidelines and approaches to health management systems and cloud platform development.Clinical Relevance - Patient Management Systems as well as lifestyle management platforms have significant clinical relevance as they allow for remote and continuous monitoring of patients' health status. LETHE aims to improve patient outcomes by providing predictive models for cognitive decline and patient adherence to the multimodal lifestyle intervention, enabling prompt and appropriate medical decisions.",2023,,Aged; Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Health Behavior; Life Style; Risk Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies,"Loukas, VS; Kassiotis, T; Martinez, IL; Koumakis, L; Bruinsma, J; Pasciuti, R; Balatresi, M; Tenhunen, V; Fiakkas, A; Ataliani, L; Karanasiou, GS; Tsiknakis, M; Hilberger, H; Bodenler, M; Schnalzer, B; Huber, S; Pirani, M; Colombo, M; Hanke, S; Fotiadis, DI"
"Is Maximal or Usual Walking Speed from Large Scale Wrist Sensor Data Better at Predicting Dementia, Depression and Death?","Older people are at increased risk of many adverse health outcomes, including dementia and depression, that burden the global health system. This paper presents algorithms for the large-scale assessment of daily walking speeds. We hypothesize that (i) data from wrist-worn sensors can be used to assess walking speed accurately; and that (ii) maximal daily walking speed is a better predictor of health outcomes than usual daily walking speed. First, algorithms were developed and tested using data from 101 participants aged 19 to 91 (47 ± 18) years. Participants wore an AX3 accelerometer (Axivity, UK) on their dominant wrist while undertaking daily life activities with electronic walkway data used for ground truth. Subsequently, prediction models for dementia, depression and death were developed using the data of 47,406 participants (≥ 60 years) from the UK Biobank study. Daily walking speeds were derived from 7-day AX3 data with time-to-events using electronic health records. The accuracy of derived walking speeds was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE). Time-to-events were modelled using Cox regression with inverse hazard ratios reported for univariable models and Harrell's concordance for multivariable models. Derived walking speeds had an RMSE of between 3% and 4% depending on arm position. We found that for simple models, maximal walking speed was significantly better than usual walking speed at predicting time to dementia (1.62 vs 1.34), depression (1.29 vs 1.17) and death (1.56 vs 1.27). However, the addition of known risk factors in subsequent multivariable models reduced the apparent benefit of using maximal as opposed to usual daily walking speed as the gait parameter. In summary, walking speed was accurately measured with a wrist-worn device, and maximal daily waking speed may be better than usual daily walking speed at predicting some adverse health outcomes.Clinical Relevance- This study demonstrated the validity of using a simple and unobtrusive wrist-worn sensor to remotely assess daily walking speed. As a single, modifiable and easily understood measure, maximal walking speed was shown to be better than usual walking speed at predicting time-to-dementia, depression and death. Therefore, the inclusion of maximal daily walking speed into screening programs and clinical interventions presents a promising area for further research.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Walking Speed; Walking; Wrist; Depression; Dementia,"Chan, LLY; Lord, SR; Brodie, MA"

In this perspective, we describe research efforts and challenges of cohort studies from three regions of the world: Central America, East Africa, and East Asia. These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

Dementia: Diagnostic Evaluation.,"Early and accurate diagnosis are crucial to appropriate care, ensuring timely intervention, and planning for future needs of patients with dementia. Dementia is a clinical diagnosis and should include comprehensive evaluation of patient cognitive and functional abilities, diagnostic laboratory evaluation, and brain imaging. A comprehensive evaluation for dementia includes a thorough medical history and physical examination, which may reveal important clues about the potential underlying causes of cognitive decline. A detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies can help identify any contributing factors. In addition, validated cognitive assessment tools can help clinicians identify the extent and nature of cognitive deficits, and track disease progression over time. Advances in the field of dementia research, such as serum biomarkers, are showing promise in facilitating an earlier and more accurate diagnosis. With the rise of telemedicine, new opportunities for virtual diagnosis have emerged, which can expand access to care for individuals in remote or underserved areas. The use of telemedicine for dementia diagnosis is still in its infancy, but research suggests that it has the potential to be an effective and convenient tool for evaluating patients with suspected dementia.",2023,,Humans; Dementia; Physical Examination,"Fishbein, E"

As internet use among older adults from underrepresented populations continues to grow, internet-based research shows promise as a feasible, valid approach to engagement and longitudinal assessment.

Polypathology-associated neurodegeneration after remote head injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. TBI ranges from mild to severe and is a recognized risk factor for later neurodegenerative conditions including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The development of CTE is typically associated with repetitive exposure to mild TBI (mTBI), while a single moderate-to-severe TBI is considered a risk factor for AD and PD. Polypathology is common, and the lines between these conditions post TBI can be somewhat blurred. The mechanisms through which TBI leads to future neurodegeneration are not well understood. Heterogeneity and distance from the injury or injuries and individual genetic and environmental factors make clinical studies difficult. We present the case of an 82-year-old man who died 4 years after developing a phenotypically mixed dementia with neuropsychiatric features and parkinsonism. He had a remote history of a severe TBI 40 years prior, following a road traffic accident which caused a large right frontal injury, requiring neurosurgical intervention. Post-mortem neuropathological examination demonstrated abnormal phosphorylated-Tau (p-Tau), beta-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and α-synuclein deposition. Spatial immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased perivascular accumulation of p-Tau with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption at the site of injury, which decreased with distance from the injury site. The appearances are suggestive of initial vascular disruption with persisting BBB disruption as a driver of the pathology.",2023,,"Male; Humans; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; tau Proteins; Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain","Brennan, D; Delaney, C; Farrell, M; Campbell, M; Doherty, CP"

"Spinal cord injury induced exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease like pathophysiology is reduced by topical application of nanowired cerebrolysin with monoclonal antibodies to amyloid beta peptide, p-tau and tumor necrosis factor alpha.","Hallmark of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid beta peptide and phosphorylated tau deposition in brain that could be aggravated following traumatic of concussive head injury. However, amyloid beta peptide or p-tau in spinal cord following injury is not well known. In this investigation we measured amyloid beta peptide and p-tau together with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in spinal cord and brain following 48 h after spinal cord injury in relation to the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barrier, edema formation, blood flow changes and cell injury in perifocal regions of the spinal cord and brain areas. A focal spinal cord injury was inflicted over the right dorsal horn of the T10-11 segment (4 mm long and 2 mm deep) and amyloid beta peptide and p-tau was measured in perifocal rostral (T9) and caudal (T12) spinal cord segments as well as in the brain areas. Our observations showed a significant increase in amyloid beta peptide in the T9 and T12 segments as well as in remote areas of brain and spinal cord after 24 and 48 h injury. This is associated with breakdown of the blood-spinal cord (BSCB) and brain barriers (BBB), edema formation, reduction in blood flow and cell injury. After 48 h of spinal cord injury elevation of amyloid beta peptide, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was seen in T9 and T12 segments of spinal cord in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and brain stem regions associated with microglial activation as seen by upregulation of Iba1 and CD86. Repeated nanowired delivery of cerebrolysin topically over the traumatized segment repeatedly together with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to amyloid beta peptide (AβP), p-tau and TNF-α significantly attenuated amyloid beta peptide, p-tau deposition and reduces Iba1, CD68 and TNF-α levels in the brain and spinal cord along with blockade of BBB and BSCB, reduction in blood flow, edema formation and cell injury.

Synthesizing images of tau pathology from cross-modal neuroimaging using deep learning.,"Given the prevalence of dementia and the development of pathology-specific disease-modifying therapies, high-value biomarker strategies to inform medical decision-making are critical. In vivo tau-PET is an ideal target as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and treatment outcome measure. However, tau-PET is not currently widely accessible to patients compared to other neuroimaging methods. In this study, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that imputes tau-PET images from more widely available cross-modality imaging inputs. Participants (n = 1192) with brain T1-weighted MRI (T1w), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, amyloid-PET and tau-PET were included. We found that a CNN model can impute tau-PET images with high accuracy, the highest being for the FDG-based model followed by amyloid-PET and T1w. In testing implications of artificial intelligence-imputed tau-PET, only the FDG-based model showed a significant improvement of performance in classifying tau positivity and diagnostic groups compared to the original input data, suggesting that application of the model could enhance the utility of the metabolic images. The interpretability experiment revealed that the FDG- and T1w-based models utilized the non-local input from physically remote regions of interest to estimate the tau-PET, but this was not the case for the Pittsburgh compound B-based model. This implies that the model can learn the distinct biological relationship between FDG-PET, T1w and tau-PET from the relationship between amyloid-PET and tau-PET. Our study suggests that extending neuroimaging's use with artificial intelligence to predict protein specific pathologies has great potential to inform emerging care models.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; FDG PET; cross-modality imputation; deep learning; tau PET,Humans; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Artificial Intelligence; Biomarkers; Deep Learning; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Neuroimaging; Tauopathies,"Lee, J; Burkett, BJ; Min, HK; Senjem, ML; Dicks, E; Corriveau-Lecavalier, N; Mester, CT; Wiste, HJ; Lundt, ES; Murray, ME; Nguyen, AT; Reichard, RR; Botha, H; Graff-Radford, J; Barnard, LR; Gunter, JL; Schwarz, CG; Kantarci, K; Knopman, DS; Boeve, BF; Lowe, VJ; Petersen, RC; Jack, CR; Jones, DT"

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some memory services have adapted to the new environment by shifting to remote assessments of patients to meet service user demand. However, the use of remote cognitive assessments has been inconsistent, and there has been little evaluation of the outcome of such a change in clinical practice.

Enabling Remote Elderly Care: Design and Implementation of a Smart Energy Data System with Activity Recognition.,"Seniors face many challenges as they age, such as dementia, cognitive and memory disorders, vision and hearing impairment, among others. Although most of them would like to stay in their own homes, as they feel comfortable and safe, in some cases, older people are taken to special institutions, such as nursing homes. In order to provide serious and quality care to elderly people at home, continuous remote monitoring is perceived as a solution to keep them connected to healthcare service providers. The new trend in medical health services, in general, is to move from 'hospital-centric' services to 'home-centric' services with the aim of reducing the costs of medical treatments and improving the recovery experience of patients, among other benefits for both patients and medical centers. Smart energy data captured from electrical home appliance sensors open a new opportunity for remote healthcare monitoring, linking the patient's health-state/health-condition with routine behaviors and activities over time. It is known that deviation from the normal routine can indicate abnormal conditions such as sleep disturbance, confusion, or memory problems. This work proposes the development and deployment of a smart energy data with activity recognition (SEDAR) system that uses machine learning (ML) techniques to identify appliance usage and behavior patterns oriented to older people living alone. The proposed system opens the door to a range of applications that go beyond healthcare, such as energy management strategies, load balancing techniques, and appliance-specific optimizations. This solution impacts on the massive adoption of telehealth in third-world economies where access to smart meters is still limited.",2023,activity detection; appliance recognition; load monitoring; machine learning; non-obtrusiveness; remote healthcare; simultaneous detection,Humans; Aged; Delivery of Health Care; Telemedicine; Hospitals,"Franco, P; Condon, F; Martínez, JM; Ahmed, MA"

Validating virtual administration of neuropsychological testing in Parkinson disease: a pilot study.,"COVID-19 has highlighted the need for remote cognitive testing, but the reliability and validity of virtual cognitive testing in Parkinson disease (PD) is unknown. Therefore, we assessed PD participants enrolled in an observational, cognition-focused study with an extensive cognitive battery completed both in-person and via video conference close in time. Data for 35 PD participants with normal cognition to mild dementia were analyzed. Only one test (semantic verbal fluency) demonstrated a difference in score by administration type, with a significantly better score virtually. Only three tests demonstrated good reliability for in-person versus virtual testing, but reliability values for visit 1 versus visit 2 were similarly low overall. Trail Making Test B was successfully administered virtually to only 18 participants due to technical issues. Virtual and in-person cognitive testing generate similar scores at the group level, but with poor to moderate reliability for most tests. Mode of test administration, learning effects, and technical difficulties explained little of the low test-retest reliability, indicating possible significant short-term variability in cognitive performance in PD in general, which has implications for clinical care and research. In-person cognitive testing with a neuropsychologist remains the gold standard, and it remains to be determined if virtual cognitive testing is feasible in PD.",2023,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Cognition Disorders; Pilot Projects; Reproducibility of Results; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Gallagher, J; Mamikonyan, E; Xie, SX; Tran, B; Shaw, S; Weintraub, D"

Remote evaluation of sleep to enhance understanding of early dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (RESTED-AD): an observational cohort study protocol.,"Sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are well recognised in both AD (Alzheimer's Disease) dementia and MCI-AD (Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease). Such abnormalities include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, decreased sleep efficiency, increased sleep fragmentation and sundowning. Enhancing understanding of sleep abnormalities may unveil targets for intervention in sleep, a promising approach given hypotheses that sleep disorders may exacerbate AD pathological progression and represent a contributory factor toward impaired cognitive performance and worse quality of life. This may also permit early diagnosis of AD pathology, widely acknowledged as a pre-requisite for future disease-modifying therapies. This study aims to bridge the divide between in-laboratory polysomnographic studies which allow for rich characterisation of sleep but in an unnatural setting, and naturalistic studies typically approximating sleep through use of non-EEG wearable devices. It is also designed to record sleep patterns over a 2 month duration sufficient to capture both infradian rhythm and compensatory responses following suboptimal sleep. Finally, it harnesses an extensively phenotyped population including with AD blood biomarkers. Its principal aims are to improve characterisation of sleep and biological rhythms in individuals with AD, particularly focusing on micro-architectural measures of sleep, compensatory responses to suboptimal sleep and the relationship between sleep parameters, biological rhythms and cognitive performance.",2023,AD; Alzheimer’s disease; Circadian; Dementia; EEG; Infradian; MCI; Mild cognitive impairment; Sleep,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Quality of Life; Sleep; Dementia; Cohort Studies; Observational Studies as Topic,"Blackman, J; Morrison, HD; Gabb, V; Biswas, B; Li, H; Turner, N; Jolly, A; Trender, W; Hampshire, A; Whone, A; Coulthard, E"
Virtual Assessment as a Way to Reduce Help-seeking Barriers in Older Adults With Subjective Cognitive Decline.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a potential early marker for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease, is common among older adults. Although it is often regarded as a personal health concern, most individuals with SCD do not seek help from a health care professional. Help-seeking (HS) is a complex, individualized process with significant life-course implications, and older adults often face several barriers to HS across personal, socioeconomic, and cultural domains. The pandemic exacerbated these barriers by imposing additional limitations on in-person care. In response, virtual assessment became a popular method to conduct remote care. We provide a narrative review of the challenges and triumphs that came with the transition from in-person, pen-paper cognitive assessments to virtual cognitive assessments. In addition, we address the impact virtual assessment had in tackling barriers that previously limited individuals with SCD from formal HS. We argue that virtual cognitive assessment helps alleviate health access barriers to HS (e.g., cost, transportation, and physician availability) and allows individuals with different coping styles to undergo assessment within more convenient environments. We hope the findings presented in this review inform health care practice, public education, and future research targeted towards the use of virtual assessment to facilitate HS in older adults with SCD.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease,"Kann, MR; Zeiger, PJ; Rizer, SJ; Cosentino, S; Azar, M"

Current emerging novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease and the future prospects of magneto-mechanical force therapy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly, and the morbidity increases with the aging population aggravation. The clinical symptoms of AD mainly include cognitive impairment and memory loss, which undoubtedly bring a huge burden to families and society. Currently, the drugs in clinical use only improve the symptoms of AD but do not cure or prevent the progression of the disease. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop novel therapeutic strategies for effective AD treatment. To provide a better theoretical basis for exploring novel therapeutic strategies in future AD treatment, this review introduces the recent AD treatment technologies from three aspects, including nanoparticle (NP) based drug therapy, biological therapy and physical therapy. The nanoparticle-mediated therapeutic approaches at the nanomaterial-neural interface and biological system are described in detail, and in particular the magneto-regulated strategies by magnetic field actuating magnetic nanoparticles are highlighted. Promising application of magneto-mechanical force regulated strategy in future AD treatment is also addressed, which offer possibilities for the remote manipulation in a precise manner. In the future, it may be possible for physicians to realize a remote, precise and effective therapy for AD using magneto-mechanical force regulated technology based on the combination of magnetic nanoparticles and an external magnetic field.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Shen, Y; Wang, M; Li, S; Yang, J"
Together yet apart: Rethinking creativity and relational dementia care during the Covid-19 pandemic.,"Culture Box was a creative project that responded to deprivation and distress experienced by those with dementia in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote and digital creative activities were designed and delivered as 'Culture Boxes' to care homes, aiming to alleviate social isolation and loneliness for people with dementia. Eighty-eight people with dementia and 33 care staff from 33 care homes across England were recruited to the study, with 68 people with dementia and 28 staff completing the study 12 months later. Participatory Action Research combining mixed methods was used to evaluate the project. Baseline and follow-up surveys and dialogic interviews at 3 time points during the study collected quantitative and qualitative data and were analysed descriptively and via inductive thematic analysis respectively. Qualitative findings indicated that the project activities facilitated relational care through creative experiences characterised by sharing, building relationships, and developing a sense of community. Social health was promoted via participation in social activities and fostering independence. Future studies should further explore the utility of creative practices to develop relational care, to support care staff, and to maximise wellbeing benefits for those living with dementia.",2023,COVID-19 pandemic; Creativity; Dementia; Relational care; social health,Humans; Dementia; Pandemics; COVID-19; Research Design; England,"Tischler, V; Zeilig, H; O'Malley, M; Asker, C"

This study adopted a mixed-methods approach and was part of a randomized clinical trial, with blinded assessors, comprising two groups: the Intervention Group (IG) receiving a telerehabilitation program involving standardized physical exercises for older adults with dementia, along with caregiver guidelines for the caregiver; and the Control Group (CG) receiving remote monitoring. At baseline, factors related to older adults with dementia and their caregivers were measured. After 12 weeks, caregiver satisfaction with the interventions was assessed. The final sample consisted of 64 pairs of family caregivers and older people with dementia. Caregivers in the IG showed higher satisfaction levels with the intervention, Internet-based treatment, and healthcare received compared to caregivers in the CG. Both groups expressed positive views towards the treatment, with excellent ratings for audio and video quality, and a preference for Internet-based treatment over face-to-face. In the IG, only the amount of time dedicated to caregiving influenced satisfaction with the intervention, whereas in the CG, cognitive and functional performance of the older people influenced satisfaction with remote monitoring.

TIHM: An open dataset for remote healthcare monitoring in dementia.,"Dementia is a progressive condition that affects cognitive and functional abilities. There is a need for reliable and continuous health monitoring of People Living with Dementia (PLWD) to improve their quality of life and support their independent living. Healthcare services often focus on addressing and treating already established health conditions that affect PLWD. Managing these conditions continuously can inform better decision-making earlier for higher-quality care management for PLWD. The Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) project developed a new digital platform to routinely collect longitudinal, observational, and measurement data, within the home and apply machine learning and analytical models for the detection and prediction of adverse health events affecting the well-being of PLWD.

Online gallery facilitated art activities for people with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: A narrative review.,"Art activities for people with dementia have a range of therapeutic benefits including psychosocial wellbeing and enhanced quality of life. Successful art programs promote social engagement, are inclusive and empowering, and enable opportunity for people with dementia to express themselves verbally and non-verbally. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing precautions have impacted the capacity of art galleries and museums to deliver in-person programs. However, they have also provided a new opportunity. This paper explores the potential benefits, challenges, and future directions for research relating to the online delivery of gallery-facilitated art activities for people with dementia. The evidence revealed that increased digitisation of programs increased access for participants, however, the majority of the research was published before the pandemic. Nevertheless, COVID-19 has necessitated many museums and galleries to engage with people with dementia online. Future research is needed to improve the usability of online delivery platforms and a comparison of online and onsite delivery is recommended, particularly to evaluate benefits to people living in rural and remote areas where access to museums and galleries may be limited.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; art gallery; dementia; museum; technology,Humans; Dementia; Pandemics; Quality of Life; COVID-19; Art Therapy,"Wiseman, L; Isbel, S; Boag, A; Halpin-Healy, C; Gibson, D; Bail, K; Noble, JM; D'Cunha, NM"

European Projects for Patients with Dementia and Their Caregivers.,"As we all know there is no treatment that can stop or delay the progression of dementia. The treatment we use is only symptomatic. EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) recommendations for dementia prevention by Sorbi et al. (2012) concluded that there is no treatment, no lifestyle, which could have an effect on prevention or delay of onset of different forms of dementia until today. The future studies in prevention must recruit younger people, larger sample, and for longer period. The last 10 years we have run, in collaboration with organizations in different European countries, many projects in order to support patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly patients with dementia and their caregivers. The first project was a 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe: predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS (Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe) study, an FP5 project with 1380 patients. Five studies were published. The second project was DESCRIPA study, an FP5 project to DEvelopment of Screening guidelines and clinical CRIteria for Predementia Alzheimer's disease, with 881 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). LLM (Long Lasting Memories) and VRADA (A virtual reality application for the exercise of dementia and Alzheimer patients) are two projects that include body and cognitive exercise for health for the elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment. The next is the RECAGE (REspectful Caring for the AGitated Elderly) project (Horizon 2020), a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. With six European universities we finished a very interesting FP6 project, the AddNeuroMed one, which gives even now information about the progression of normal elderly MCI and AD patients, in collaboration with other consortia. A very interesting Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project about digital biomarkers was entitled Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR project). The main goal of this project was the development and validation of technology-enabled, quantitative and sensitive measures of functional decline in people with early-stage AD. A running project is an Erasmus+ one in the higher education field, ""Genetic counseling in European universities: The case of neurodegenerative diseases"" (GECONEU project). The target of this study is to develop an online course for university students focusing on genetic counseling, and support people and society to better understand the aims of genetic testing and the usefulness of genetic counseling by involving students in an innovative learning and teaching setting.

Remote ischemic conditioning alleviates chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction via the miR-218a-5p/SHANK2 pathway.,"Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) due to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), is the second leading cause of dementia. Although synaptic impairment plays a critical role in VCI, its exact mechanism remains unknown. Our previous research revealed that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) could alleviate cognitive decline resulting from CCH, however, its effects on synaptic impairment remain unclear. In this study, we confirmed that RIC alleviated both cognitive decline and its associated synaptic dysfunction caused by CCH. RNA sequencing revealed that CCH increased in miR-218a-5p expression, which was decreased by RIC. Elevated miR-218a-5p levels limited the benefits of RIC, however, inhibiting miR-218a-5p in hippocampal CA1 neurons rescued synaptic dysfunction. Additionally, we found that SHANK2 is a downstream target of miR-218a-5p, and inhibiting SHANK2 expression reduced the alleviation caused by hypoxic conditioning in synaptic impairment in vitro. In conclusion, our results suggested that RIC alleviated synaptic impairment via the miR-218a-5p/SHANK2 pathway, which could be a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for cognitive impairment caused by CCH.",2023,Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion; Remote ischemic conditioning; SHANK2; Synaptic function; Vascular cognitive impairment; miR-218a-5p,Humans; Brain Ischemia; Cognitive Dysfunction; Hippocampus; MicroRNAs; Nerve Tissue Proteins,"Li, N; Ren, C; Li, S; Yu, W; Jin, K; Ji, X"

Eye-tracking paradigms for the assessment of mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), representing the 'transitional zone' between normal cognition and dementia, has become a novel topic in clinical research. Although early detection is crucial, it remains logistically challenging at the same time. While traditional pen-and-paper tests require in-depth training to ensure standardized administration and accurate interpretation of findings, significant technological advancements are leading to the development of procedures for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and facilitating the diagnostic process. Some of the diagnostic protocols, however, show significant limitations that hamper their widespread adoption. Concerns about the social and economic implications of the increasing incidence of AD underline the need for reliable, non-invasive, cost-effective, and timely cognitive scoring methodologies. For instance, modern clinical studies report significant oculomotor impairments among patients with MCI, who perform poorly in visual paired-comparison tasks by ascribing less attentional resources to novel stimuli. To accelerate the Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017-2025, this work provides an overview of research on saccadic and exploratory eye-movement deficits among older adults with MCI. The review protocol was drafted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2022 that examined visual processing in older adults with MCI and reported gaze parameters as potential biomarkers. Moreover, following the contemporary trend for remote healthcare technologies, we reviewed studies that implemented non-commercial eye-tracking instrumentation in order to detect information processing impairments among the MCI population. Based on the gathered literature, eye-tracking-based paradigms may ameliorate the screening limitations of traditional cognitive assessments and contribute to early AD detection. However, in order to translate the findings pertaining to abnormal gaze behavior into clinical applications, it is imperative to conduct longitudinal investigations in both laboratory-based and ecologically valid settings.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; cognitive assessment; dementia; eye-tracking; information processing; mild cognitive impairment; screening,,"Wolf, A; Tripanpitak, K; Umeda, S; Otake-Matsuura, M"
Capturing Measures That Matter: The Potential Value of Digital Measures of Physical Behavior for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of dementia worldwide. Despite the magnitude of AD's impact on patients, caregivers, and society, nearly all AD clinical trials fail. A potential contributor to this high rate of failure is that established clinical outcome assessments fail to capture subtle clinical changes, entail high burden for patients and their caregivers, and ineffectively address the aspects of health deemed important by patients and their caregivers. AD progression is associated with widespread changes in physical behavior that have impacts on the ability to function independently, which is a meaningful aspect of health for patients with AD and important for diagnosis. However, established assessments of functional independence remain underutilized in AD clinical trials and are limited by subjective biases and ceiling effects. Digital measures of real-world physical behavior assessed passively, continuously, and remotely using digital health technologies have the potential to address some of these limitations and to capture aspects of functional independence in patients with AD. In particular, measures of real-world gait, physical activity, and life-space mobility captured with wearable sensors may offer value. Additional research is needed to understand the validity, feasibility, and acceptability of these measures in AD clinical research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; digital measure; drug development; gait; life-space mobility; meaningful aspect of health; physical behavior; physical function; wearable sensor,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Caregivers; Drug Development,"Bachman, SL; Blankenship, JM; Busa, M; Serviente, C; Lyden, K; Clay, I"

A FinnGen pilot clinical recall study for Alzheimer's disease.,"Successful development of novel therapies requires that clinical trials are conducted in patient cohorts with the highest benefit-to-risk ratio. Population-based biobanks with comprehensive health and genetic data from large numbers of individuals hold promise to facilitate identification of trial participants, particularly when interventions need to start while symptoms are still mild, such as for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study describes a process for clinical recall studies from FinnGen. We demonstrate the feasibility to systematically ascertain customized clinical data from FinnGen participants with ICD10 diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive disorder (MCD) in a single-center cross-sectional study testing blood-based biomarkers and cognitive functioning in-person, computer-based and remote. As a result, 19% (27/140) of a pre-specified FinnGen subcohort were successfully recalled and completed the study. Hospital records largely validated registry entries. For 8/12 MCD patients, other reasons than AD were identified as underlying diagnosis. Cognitive measures correlated across platforms, with highest consistencies for dementia screening (r = 0.818) and semantic fluency (r = 0.764), respectively, for in-person versus telephone-administered tests. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (p < 0.002) and phosphorylated-tau 181 (pTau-181) (p < 0.020) most reliably differentiated AD from MCD participants.

Participants from the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank with complete information on serum 25(OH)D concentrations were enrolled. Dementia, MCI and delirium were defined using the UK Biobank algorithm. 443,427 participants with a mean (standard deviation) age of 56.8 (8.0) years were included in this study. Based on Cox regression models, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with the risk of dementia, MCI, and delirium in a dose-dependent manner after adjusting for demographics (P-trend <0.001). In comparison with 25(OH)D levels less than 32.4 nmol/L, participants with the highest 25(OH)D levels (i.e., >64.4 nmol/L) had the lowest risk of dementia (hazards ratio [HR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.69, P<0.001), MCI (HR: 0.55, 95% CI 0.37-0.84, P=0.005), and delirium (HR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.79, P<0.001). These results were consistent with the sensitivity analysis, in which participants with events occurring within the first two years of follow-up were excluded.

Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) applications in cognitive aging: a review and commentary.,"Differentiating healthy from pathological aging trajectories is extremely timely, as the global population faces an inversion where older adults will soon outnumber younger 5:1. Many cognitive functions (e.g., memory, executive functions, and processing speed) decline with age, a process that can begin as early as midlife, and which predicts subsequent diagnosis with dementia. Although dementia is a devastating and costly diagnosis, there remains limited evidence for medications, therapies, and devices that improve cognition or attenuate the transition into dementia. There is an urgent need to intervene early in neurodegenerative processes leading to dementia (e.g., depression and mild cognitive impairment). In this targeted review and commentary, we highlight transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) as a neurostimulation method with unique opportunities for applications in diseases of aging, reviewing recent literature, feasibility of use with remote data collection methods/telehealth, as well as limitations and conflicts in the literature. In particular, small sample sizes, uneven age distributions of participants, lack of standardized protocols, and oversampling of non-representative groups (e.g., older adults with no comorbid diagnoses) limit our understanding of the potential of this method. We offer recommendations for how to improve representativeness, statistical power, and generalizability of tVNS research by integrating remote data collection techniques.",2023,cognition; dementia; healthy aging; remote data collection; transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS),,"Naparstek, S; Yeh, AK; Mills-Finnerty, C"

Standardised data collection from people with dementia over the telephone: A qualitative study of the experience of DETERMIND programme researchers in a pandemic.,"There is a notable lack of evidence on what constitutes good practice in remote quantitative data collection from research participants with dementia. During the COVID-19 pandemic face-to-face research became problematic, especially where participants were older and more at risk of infection. The DETERMIND-C19 study, a large cohort study of people with dementia, switched to telephone data collection over this period. This paper explores the experiences of researchers who collected quantitative data over the telephone from people with dementia during the first COVID-19 lockdowns in England. The aim was to learn from these experiences, share insights and inform future research practice across disciplines. Seven DETERMIND researchers were interviewed about the processes and challenges of collecting quantitative data from people with dementia over the telephone compared to face-to-face. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Two themes were developed: first the telephone adds an extra layer of confusion to an already cognitively complex interaction. Second, researchers found it difficult to recognise subtle cues that signalled participants' rising emotion over the telephone in time to prevent distress. The researchers employed strategies to support participants which may not have conformed to the strict conventions of structured interviewing, but which were informed by person-oriented principles. Whilst in practice this may be a common approach to balancing the needs of participants and the requirements of quantitative research, it is rare for studies to openly discuss such trade-offs in the literature. Honest, reflective reporting is required if the practice of remote data collection from people with dementia is to progress ethically and with integrity.",2023,data collection; dementia; person-oriented; standardised measures; telephone interviews,Humans; Pandemics; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Telephone; Data Collection,"Gridley, K; Dixon, J; Hicks, B; Birks, Y; Baxter, K; Miles, E; Robinson, L; Perach, R; Banerjee, S"
Video-Based Activity Recognition for Automated Motor Assessment of Parkinson's Disease.,"Over the last decade, video-enabled mobile devices have become ubiquitous, while advances in markerless pose estimation allow an individual's body position to be tracked accurately and efficiently across the frames of a video. Previous work by this and other groups has shown that pose-extracted kinematic features can be used to reliably measure motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). This presents the prospect of developing an asynchronous and scalable, video-based assessment of motor dysfunction. Crucial to this endeavour is the ability to automatically recognise the class of an action being performed, without which manual labelling is required. Representing the evolution of body joint locations as a spatio-temporal graph, we implement a deep-learning model for video and frame-level classification of activities performed according to part 3 of the Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). We train and validate this system using a dataset of n = 7310 video clips, recorded at 5 independent sites. This approach reaches human-level performance in detecting and classifying periods of activity within monocular video clips. Our framework could support clinical workflows and patient care at scale through applications such as quality monitoring of clinical data collection, automated labelling of video streams, or a module within a remote self-assessment system.",2023,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Severity of Illness Index; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Biomechanical Phenomena,"Sarapata, G; Dushin, Y; Morinan, G; Ong, J; Budhdeo, S; Kainz, B; O'Keeffe, J"
Remote ischemic conditioning for stroke: A critical systematic review.,"Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is the application of brief periods of ischemia to an organ or tissue with the aim of inducing protection from ischemia in a distant organ. It was first developed as a cardioprotective strategy but has been increasingly investigated as a neuroprotective intervention. The mechanisms by which RIC achieves neuroprotection are incompletely understood. Preclinical studies focus on the hypothesis that RIC can protect the brain from ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury following the restoration of blood flow after occlusion of a large cerebral artery. However, increasingly, a role of chronic RIC (CRIC) is being investigated as a means of promoting recovery following an ischemic insult to the brain. The recent publication of two large, randomized control trials has provided promise that RIC could improve functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke, and that there may be a role for CRIC in the prevention of recurrent stroke. Although less developed, there is also proof-of-concept to suggest that RIC may be used to reduce vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage or improve cognitive outcomes in vascular dementia. As a cheap, well-tolerated and almost universally applicable intervention, the motivation for investigating possible benefit of RIC in patients with cerebrovascular disease is great. In this review, we shall review the current evidence for RIC as applied to cerebrovascular disease.",2024,Stroke; remote ischemic conditioning; systematic review,Humans; Stroke; Ischemic Stroke; Brain; Ischemia; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"Keevil, H; Phillips, BE; England, TJ"
Digital endpoints in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases: challenges and opportunities.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD) are associated with progressive cognitive, motor, affective and consequently functional decline considerably affecting Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and quality of life.

The aim of this study is therefore to find which specific ethical challenges are raised by RECs in the context of a large European study on remote monitoring in all syndromic stages of Alzheimer's disease, and what gaps remain.",2023,,"Humans; Ethics Committees, Research; Alzheimer Disease; Ethical Review; Ethics, Research; Europe","Muurling, M; Pasmooij, AMG; Koychev, I; Roik, D; Froelich, L; Schwertner, E; Religa, D; Abdelnour, C; Boada, M; Almici, M; Galluzzi, S; Cardoso, S; de Mendonça, A; Owens, AP; Kuruppu, S; Gjestsen, MT; Lazarou, I; Gkioka, M; Tsolaki, M; Diaz, A; Gove, D; Visser, PJ; Aarsland, D; Lucivero, F; de Boer, C"

A review of different types of volunteer programs for older adults with and without cognitive impairment.,"Theoretical models and empirical evidence suggest an association between volunteering and health outcomes in older adults. However, less is known about existing programs that involve older adults engaging in formal volunteering, especially programs for older volunteers with cognitive impairment. In this review, we summarized and evaluated different types of volunteering-based programs involving older volunteers with and without cognitive impairment. After a non-systematic literature search, we presented eight example volunteer programs. Older volunteers participate in the programs in person or remotely. In five of the programs, older volunteers without cognitive impairment participate in intergenerational engagement, support and referral, home visiting, and dementia care services. The other three programs specifically recruit older volunteers with cognitive impairment and provide intergenerational engagement and individualized volunteer activities. Both strengths and challenges identified in the programs were discussed. Different types of volunteering-based programs are available for engaging older volunteers. For volunteers to remain active during the pandemic or for volunteers who live with cognitive impairment, remote programs can be a valuable alternative. Program effects on older volunteers need to be tested in more rigorously designed studies.",2023,activity; cognitive impairment; intervention; older volunteers; volunteering,Humans; Aged; Volunteers; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Zhu, X; Dong, Z; Wu, Y; Xu, DW"
Stricker Learning Span criterion validity: a remote self-administered multi-device compatible digital word list memory measure shows similar ability to differentiate amyloid and tau PET-defined biomarker groups as in-person Auditory Verbal Learning Test.,The Stricker Learning Span (SLS) is a computer-adaptive digital word list memory test specifically designed for remote assessment and self-administration on a web-based multi-device platform (Mayo Test Drive).

Impact of Advance Care Planning on the Hospitalization-Associated Utilization and Cost of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease-Related Disorders Receiving Primary Care via Telehealth in a Provider Shortage Area: A Quantitative Pre-Study.,"Telehealth has been adopted as an alternative to in-person primary care visits. With multiple participants able to join remotely, telehealth can facilitate the discussion and documentation of advance care planning (ACP) for those with Alzheimer's disease-related disorders (ADRDs). We measured hospitalization-associated utilization outcomes, instances of hospitalization and 90-day re-hospitalizations from payors' administrative databases and verified the data via electronic health records. We estimated the hospitalization-associated costs using the Nevada State Inpatient Dataset and compared the estimated costs between ADRD patients with and without ACP documentation in the year 2021.

Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Speech and language changes occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few studies have characterized their longitudinal course. We analyzed open-ended speech samples from a prodromal-to-mild AD cohort to develop a novel composite score to characterize progressive speech changes. Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD. Speech-based composite scores could be used to monitor change and detect response to treatment in future research.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; digital biomarkers; language; mild cognitive impairment; natural language processing; speech,,"Robin, J; Xu, M; Balagopalan, A; Novikova, J; Kahn, L; Oday, A; Hejrati, M; Hashemifar, S; Negahdar, M; Simpson, W; Teng, E"

Practitioners' ability to remotely develop understanding for personalised care and support planning: a thematic analysis of multiple data sources from the feasibility phase of the Dementia Personalised Care Team (D-PACT) intervention.,"Practitioner understanding of patients' preferences, wishes and needs is essential for personalised health care i.e., focusing on 'what matters' to people based on their individual life situation. To develop such an understanding, dementia practitioners need to use communication practices that help people share their experiences, preferences, and priorities. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, dementia support is likely to continue to be delivered both remotely and in-person. This study analysed multiple sources of qualitative data to examine the views of practitioners, people living with dementia and carers, and researchers on how an understanding of what matters to people living with dementia can be developed remotely via telephone and video call. Access to environmental stimuli, the remote use of visual tools, peoples' tendency to downplay or omit details about their troubles and carers' ability to disclose privately were interpreted, through thematic analysis, to be factors affecting how practitioners sought to develop understanding remotely. Cumulatively, findings show that while remote support created unique challenges to practitioners' ability to develop understanding for personalised care, practitioners developed adaptive strategies to overcome some of these challenges. Further research should examine how, when and for whom these adapted practices for remote personalised care work, informing the development of evidence-based guidance and training on how practitioners can remotely develop the understanding required for personalised care.",2023,communication; dementia; personalised care and support; remote interaction; thematic analysis,Humans; Dementia; Information Sources; Feasibility Studies; Pandemics; COVID-19; Caregivers; Patient Care Team,"Wheat, H; Griffiths, S; Gude, A; Weston, L; Quinn, C; Morgan-Trimmer, S; Oh, TM; Musicha, C; Greene, L; Clark, M; Rybczynska-Bunt, S; Byng, R"

Integrated therapist and online CBT for depression in primary care (INTERACT): study protocol for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial.,"Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depression. Self-directed online CBT interventions have made CBT more accessible at a lower cost. However, adherence is often poor and, in the absence of therapist support, effects are modest and short-term. Delivering CBT online using instant messaging is clinically and cost-effective; however, most existing platforms are limited to instant messaging sessions, without the support of between-session ""homework"" activities.

The role of performativity in informal dementia carers' capability to be mobile.,"Informal carers are and will remain a vital part of dementia care. Given the nature of their caring tasks, which focus on enabling the care recipient to engage in meaningful activities, informal dementia carers are affected in their everyday mobility. Expectations manifested by society, loved ones and the carers themselves play a critical role in how carers perform their caring role and how they perceive their opportunity, or capability, to be mobile. This article uses Butler's concept of performativity to understand informal dementia carers' capability to be mobile. In the spring and summer of 2021, we combined remote graphic elicitation with telephone interviews to gather the views of 17 informal dementia carers (aged 50+) living in England. Three key themes emerged from our analysis of the data. Firstly, participants perceived that becoming a carer changed their capability to be mobile. Secondly, the caring role in relation to the capability to be mobile resulted in an emotional toll and perceived loss of autonomy. Thirdly, the performativity of the caring role created feelings of guilt, selfishness and resentment due to the impact caring had on participants' capability to be mobile. Our study enriches the literature on informal dementia carers' mobility, as we suggest that performativity is a key factor in how this population experiences their everyday mobility. The findings suggest that existing ageing-in-place policies should take a more holistic approach by better including those ageing adults who provide the most support: informal dementia carers.",2023,Capability approach; England; Informal dementia carer; Mobility; Older adults,Adult; Humans; Dementia; Caregivers; England; Emotions; Guilt,"Lowe, TA; Meijering, L; de Haas, B"
Pacemaker Implants and Their Influence on the Daily Life of Patients with Dementia with Lewy Bodies: A Qualitative Case Study.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is an incurable form of dementia associated with detriments to the daily life of patients and carers from their family. Symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and falls are supportive of DLB diagnosis. These symptoms may also be present among people with sick sinus syndrome (SSS), and subsequent pacemaker treatment to manage bradyarrhythmia is associated with improved cognitive function. The prevalence of SSS seems to be higher among people with underlying Lewy body pathology compared to the general age-matched population (5.2% vs. 0.17%). To our knowledge, how people with DLB and their family carers may experience pacemaker treatment to manage bradyarrhythmia has not been previously reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore how people with DLB experience daily life following a pacemaker implant to manage associated symptoms of bradyarrhythmia.",2023,Bradyarrhythmia; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Pacemaker; Patient perspective; Qualitative research; Sick sinus syndrome,,"Heyman, I; Brorsson, A; Persson, T; Londos, E"

"The pursuit of approaches to federate data to accelerate Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research: GAAIN, DPUK, and ADDI.","There is common consensus that data sharing accelerates science. Data sharing enhances the utility of data and promotes the creation and competition of scientific ideas. Within the Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) community, data types and modalities are spread across many organizations, geographies, and governance structures. The ADRD community is not alone in facing these challenges, however, the problem is even more difficult because of the need to share complex biomarker data from centers around the world. Heavy-handed data sharing mandates have, to date, been met with limited success and often outright resistance. Interest in making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) has often resulted in centralized platforms. However, when data governance and sovereignty structures do not allow the movement of data, other methods, such as federation, must be pursued. Implementation of fully federated data approaches are not without their challenges. The user experience may become more complicated, and federated analysis of unstructured data types remains challenging. Advancement in federated data sharing should be accompanied by improvement in federated learning methodologies so that federated data sharing becomes functionally equivalent to direct access to record level data. In this article, we discuss federated data sharing approaches implemented by three data platforms in the ADRD field: Dementia's Platform UK (DPUK) in 2014, the Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) in 2012, and the Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative (ADDI) in 2020.

Digital tools for delivery of dementia education for caregivers of persons with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of impact on caregiver distress and depressive symptoms.,"Continuing education for dementia has been shown to be beneficial by improving informal caregiver knowledge, dementia care, management, and caregiver physical and mental health. Technology-based dementia education has been noted to have equivalent effects as in-person education, but with the added benefit of asynchronous and/or remote delivery, which increases accessibility. Using Cochrane review methodology, this study systematically reviewed the literature on technology-based dementia education and its impacts on caregivers. Technology-based delivery included dementia education delivered via the Internet, telephone, telehealth, videophone, computer, or digital video device (DVD). In the review, twenty-eight studies were identified with fourteen included in a meta-analysis, and these data revealed a significant small effect of technologically based dementia education on reducing caregiver depression, and a medium effect on reducing caregiver distress in response to caregivers' observations of behavioral problems displayed by persons with dementia. No evidence was found for a significant effect of the educational intervention on caregiver burden or self-efficacy, which are known to be gendered aspects of caregiving. None of the studies included in the meta-analysis reported separate outcomes for male and female care providers, which has implications for gendered caregiving norms and aspects of care.

"Unsupervised, frequent and remote: A novel platform for personalised digital phenotyping of long-term memory in humans.","Long-term memory tests are commonly used to facilitate the diagnosis of hippocampal-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease due to their relatively high specificity and sensitivity to damage to the medial temporal lobes compared to standard commonly used clinical tests. Pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease start years before the formal diagnosis is made, partially due to testing too late. This proof-of-concept exploratory study aimed to assess the feasibility of introducing an unsupervised digital platform for continuous testing of long-term memory over long periods outside the laboratory environment. To address this challenge, we developed a novel digital platform, hAge ('healthy Age'), which integrates double spatial alternation, image recognition and visuospatial tasks for frequent remote unsupervised assessment of spatial and non-spatial long-term memory carried out continuously over eight week period. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we tested whether we could achieve sufficient levels of adherence and whether the performance on hAge tasks is comparable to the performance observed in the analogous standard tests measured in the controlled laboratory environments.191 healthy adults (67% females, 18-81 years old) participated in the study. We report an estimated 42.4% adherence level with minimal inclusion criteria. In line with findings using standard laboratory tests, we showed that performance on the spatial alternation task negatively correlated with inter-trial periods and the performance levels on image recognition and visuospatial tasks could be controlled by varying image similarity. Importantly, we demonstrated that frequent engagement with the double spatial alternation task leads to a strong practice effect, previously identified as a potential measure of cognitive decline in MCI patients. Finally, we discuss how lifestyle and motivation confounds may present a serious challenge for cognitive assessment in real-world uncontrolled environments.",2023,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Long-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; Recognition, Psychology; Proof of Concept Study","Bauza, M; Krstulovic, M; Krupic, J"
eSticky: An Advanced Remote Reminder System for People with Early Dementia.,"While the European population is ageing, the number of people with dementia is dramatically rising. With this comes an increased need for products that help affected people to be more independent and able to live in their own home for as long as possible. eSticky addresses this need by providing a sophisticated reminder system that replaces the old-fashioned sticky notes by electronic versions thereof, which can be programmed from near and far in a device-independent manner via the internet and using a standard web browser. For this purpose, a set of low-cost ePaper displays are used, accompanied by a small and unobtrusive base station situated at the user's home, and supported by a web platform for user management and the authoring and scheduling of the message reminders. The displays can be placed at several strategically useful places in a user's home, to enable users and/or care persons to place reminders that will, based on the user's daily routines, most probably be read.

Usability of a Community-Based Dementia Resource Website: Mixed Methods Study.,"Many individuals living with dementia want to live in their own homes for as long as possible. To do so, they frequently require assistance with activities of daily living, which is often provided by friends and relatives acting as informal care partners. In Canada, many informal care partners are currently overworked and overwhelmed. Although community-based dementia-inclusive resources are available to support them, care partners often struggle to find them.

Exploring mechanisms that affect retrograde memory for public events in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: A longitudinal update.,"Here, we examined mechanisms that affect retrograde memory in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) as a function of longitudinal clinical outcome. 8 a-MCI who converted to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) during the subsequent 3-year follow-up (converter a-MCI) and 10 a-MCI who remained clinically stable during the same period (stable a-MCI) were compared at the baseline evaluation (i.e., when they were diagnosed as a-MCI) using a remote memory questionnaire for public events that allows disentangling the differential contribution of storage and retrieval mechanisms to performance accuracy. Results suggest that deficits in remote memory are primarily explained by impaired retrieval abilities in stable a-MCI and by impaired storage in converter-to-AD a-MCI. This distinction between retrograde amnesia due to defective trace utilisation in stable a-MCI and trace storage in converter a-MCI is consistent with the temporal unfolding of declining anterograde memory over the course of disease progression to AD.",2023,Alzheimer disease; memory impairment; mild cognitive impairment; public events; retrograde amnesia,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression; Neuropsychological Tests,"De Simone, MS; Rodini, M; De Tollis, M; Caltagirone, C; Carlesimo, GA"
The current state of artificial intelligence-augmented digitized neurocognitive screening test.,"The cognitive screening test is a brief cognitive examination that could be easily performed in a clinical setting. However, one of the main drawbacks of this test was that only a paper-based version was available, which restricts the test to be manually administered and graded by medical personnel at the health centers. The main solution to these problems was to develop a potential remote assessment for screening individuals with cognitive impairment. Currently, multiple studies have been adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology into these tests, evolving the conventional paper-based neurocognitive test into a digitized AI-assisted neurocognitive test. These studies provided credible evidence of the potential of AI-augmented cognitive screening tests to be better and provided the framework for future studies to further improve the implementation of AI technology in the cognitive screening test. The objective of this review article is to discuss different types of AI used in digitized cognitive screening tests and their advantages and disadvantages.",2023,artificial intelligence; automated speech recognition; cognitive assessment; computer vision; computerized screening test; dementia; machine learning,,"Sirilertmekasakul, C; Rattanawong, W; Gongvatana, A; Srikiatkhachorn, A"

Validating virtual administration of neuropsychological testing in Parkinson disease: a pilot study.,"Background COVID-19 has highlighted the need for remote cognitive testing. Virtual testing may lessen burden and can reach a larger patient population. The reliability and validity of virtual cognitive testing in Parkinson disease (PD) is unknown. Objectives To validate neuropsychological tests for virtual administration in PD. Methods Participants enrolled in an observational, cognition-focused study completed a rater-administered cognitive battery in-person and via video conference 3-7 days apart. Order of administration was counterbalanced. Analyses to compare performance by type of administration (virtual versus in-person) included paired t-test, intraclass correlation (ICC) and linear mixed-effects models. Results Data for 35 (62.9% male) PD participants (62.5% normal cognition, 37.5% cognitive impairment) were analyzed. Only the semantic verbal fluency test demonstrated a difference in score by administration type, with a significantly better score when administered virtually (paired t-test p = 0.011 and linear mixed-effects model p = 0.012). Only the Dementia Rating Scale-2, Trails A test and phonemic verbal fluency demonstrated good reliability (ICC value 0.75-0.90) for virtual versus in-person administration, and values for visit 1 versus visit 2 were similarly low overall. Trail making tests were successfully administered virtually to only 18 (51.4%) participants due to technical issues. Conclusions Virtual cognitive testing overall is feasible in PD, and virtual and in-person cognitive testing generate similar scores at the group level, but reliability is poor or moderate for most tests. Given that mode of test administration, learning effects and technical difficulties explained relatively little of the low test-retest reliability observed, there may be significant short-term variability in cognitive performance in PD in general, which has important implications for clinical care and research.",2023,,,"Weintraub, D; Gallagher, J; Mamikonyan, E; Xie, S; Tran, B; Shaw, S"

Exercise Improves Cerebral Blood Flow and Functional Outcomes in an Experimental Mouse Model of Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID).,"Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are a growing threat to public health without any known treatment. The bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model is valid for VCID. Previously, we have reported that remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) during chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) induced by BCAS increases cerebral blood flow (CBF), improves cognitive function, and reduces white matter damage. We hypothesized that physical exercise (EXR) would augment CBF during CCH and prevent cognitive impairment in the BCAS model. BCAS was performed in C57/B6 mice of both sexes to establish CCH. One week after the BCAS surgery, mice were randomized to treadmill exercise once daily or no EXR for four weeks. CBF was monitored with an LSCI pre-, post, and 4 weeks post-BCAS. Cognitive testing was performed for post-BCAS after exercise training, and brain tissue was harvested for histopathology and biochemical test. BCAS led to chronic hypoperfusion resulting in impaired cognitive function and other functional outcomes. Histological examination revealed that BCAS caused changes in neuronal morphology and cell death in the cortex and hippocampus. Immunoblotting showed that BCAS was associated with a significant downregulate of AMPK and pAMPK and NOS3 and pNOS3. BCAS also decreased red blood cell (RBC) deformability. EXR therapy increased and sustained improved CBF and cognitive function, muscular strength, reduced cell death, and loss of white matter. EXR is effective in the BCAS model, improving CBF and cognitive function, reducing white matter damage, improving RBC deformability, and increasing RBC NOS3 and AMPK. The mechanisms by which EXR improves CBF and attenuates tissue damage need further investigation.",2024,"AMPK; Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion; Exercise (EXR), Cerebral blood flow (CBF); Neurobehavioral test; Phospho-AMPK; RBC deformability, White matter (WM) degeneration, Nitric oxide synthase (NOS3); Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID); p-NOS3","Animals; Mice; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Brain Ischemia; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia, Vascular; Disease Models, Animal","Khan, MB; Alam, H; Siddiqui, S; Shaikh, MF; Sharma, A; Rehman, A; Baban, B; Arbab, AS; Hess, DC"
Effects of familiar music exposure on deliberate retrieval of remote episodic and semantic memories in healthy aging adults.,"Familiar music facilitates memory retrieval in adults with dementia. However, mechanisms behind this effect, and its generality, are unclear because of a lack of parallel work in healthy aging. Exposure to familiar music enhances spontaneous recall of memories directly cued by the music, but it is unknown whether such effects extend to deliberate recall more generally - e.g., to memories not directly linked to the music being played. It is also unclear whether familiar music boosts recall of specific episodes versus more generalised semantic memories, or whether effects are driven by domain-general mechanisms (e.g., improved mood).

The promise of portable remote auditory stimulation tools to enhance slow-wave sleep and prevent cognitive decline.,"Dementia is the seventh leading cause of mortality, and a major source of disability and dependency in older individuals globally. Cognitive decline (and, to a lesser extent, normal ageing) are associated with sleep fragmentation and loss of slow-wave sleep. Evidence suggests a bidirectional causal link between these losses. Phase-locked auditory stimulation has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool to enhance slow-wave sleep, potentially ameliorating cognitive decline. In laboratory settings, auditory stimulation is usually supervised by trained experts. Different algorithms (simple amplitude thresholds, topographic correlation, sine-wave fitting, phase-locked loop, and phase vocoder) are used to precisely target auditory stimulation to a desired phase of the slow wave. While all algorithms work well in younger adults, the altered sleep physiology of older adults and particularly those with neurodegenerative disorders requires a tailored approach that can adapt to older adults' fragmented sleep and reduced amplitudes of slow waves. Moreover, older adults might require a continuous intervention that is not feasible in laboratory settings. Recently, several auditory stimulation-capable portable devices ('Dreem®', 'SmartSleep®' and 'SleepLoop®') have been developed. We discuss these three devices regarding their potential as tools for science, and as clinical remote-intervention tools to combat cognitive decline. Currently, SleepLoop® shows the most promise for scientific research in older adults due to high transparency and customizability but is not commercially available. Studies evaluating down-stream effects on cognitive abilities, especially in patient populations, are required before a portable auditory stimulation device can be recommended as a clinical preventative remote-intervention tool.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; closed-loop; home-use devices; memory; slow-wave sleep (SWS); treatment,"Humans; Aged; Sleep, Slow-Wave; Acoustic Stimulation; Electroencephalography; Sleep; Cognitive Dysfunction","Zeller, CJ; Züst, MA; Wunderlin, M; Nissen, C; Klöppel, S"

Real-time automated detection of older adults' hand gestures in home and clinical settings.,"There is an urgent need, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, for methods that allow clinicians and neuroscientists to remotely evaluate hand movements. This would help detect and monitor degenerative brain disorders that are particularly prevalent in older adults. With the wide accessibility of computer cameras, a vision-based real-time hand gesture detection method would facilitate online assessments in home and clinical settings. However, motion blur is one of the most challenging problems in the fast-moving hands data collection. The objective of this study was to develop a computer vision-based method that accurately detects older adults' hand gestures using video data collected in real-life settings. We invited adults over 50 years old to complete validated hand movement tests (fast finger tapping and hand opening-closing) at home or in clinic. Data were collected without researcher supervision via a website programme using standard laptop and desktop cameras. We processed and labelled images, split the data into training, validation and testing, respectively, and then analysed how well different network structures detected hand gestures. We recruited 1,900 adults (age range 50-90 years) as part of the TAS Test project and developed UTAS7k-a new dataset of 7071 hand gesture images, split 4:1 into clear: motion-blurred images. Our new network, RGRNet, achieved 0.782 mean average precision (mAP) on clear images, outperforming the state-of-the-art network structure (YOLOV5-P6, mAP 0.776), and mAP 0.771 on blurred images. A new robust real-time automated network that detects static gestures from a single camera, RGRNet, and a new database comprising the largest range of individual hands, UTAS7k, both show strong potential for medical and research applications.",2023,Bradykinesia; Dementia; Hand gesture classification; Motion blur; Similar object detection; TAS Test,,"Huang, G; Tran, SN; Bai, Q; Alty, J"

Tau seeds from patients induce progressive supranuclear palsy pathology and symptoms in primates.,"Progressive supranuclear palsy is a primary tauopathy affecting both neurons and glia and is responsible for both motor and cognitive symptoms. Recently, it has been suggested that progressive supranuclear palsy tauopathy may spread in the brain from cell to cell in a 'prion-like' manner. However, direct experimental evidence of this phenomenon, and its consequences on brain functions, is still lacking in primates. In this study, we first derived sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from post-mortem brains of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We also isolated the same fraction from age-matched control brains. Compared to control extracts, the in vitro characterization of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau fractions demonstrated a high seeding activity in P301S-tau expressing cells, displaying after incubation abnormally phosphorylated (AT8- and AT100-positivity), misfolded, filamentous (pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid positive) and sarkosyl-insoluble tau. We bilaterally injected two male rhesus macaques in the supranigral area with this fraction of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau proteopathic seeds, and two other macaques with the control fraction. The quantitative analysis of kinematic features revealed that progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques exhibited symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism as early as 6 months after injection, remaining present until euthanasia at 18 months. An object retrieval task showed the progressive appearance of a significant dysexecutive syndrome in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques compared to controls. We found AT8-positive staining and 4R-tau inclusions only in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques. Characteristic pathological hallmarks of progressive supranuclear palsy, including globose and neurofibrillary tangles, tufted astrocytes and coiled bodies, were found close to the injection sites but also in connected brain regions that are known to be affected in progressive supranuclear palsy (striatum, pallidum, thalamus). Interestingly, while glial AT8-positive lesions were the most frequent near the injection site, we found mainly neuronal inclusions in the remote brain area, consistent with a neuronal transsynaptic spreading of the disease. Our results demonstrate that progressive supranuclear palsy patient-derived tau aggregates can induce motor and behavioural impairments in non-human primates related to the prion-like seeding and spreading of typical pathological progressive supranuclear palsy lesions. This pilot study paves the way for supporting progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaque as a relevant animal model to accelerate drug development targeting this rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease.",2023,non-human primate; parkinsonism; prion-like; progressive supranuclear palsy; tau; tauopathy,"Animals; Male; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; tau Proteins; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Macaca mulatta; Pilot Projects; Tauopathies; Brain","Darricau, M; Katsinelos, T; Raschella, F; Milekovic, T; Crochemore, L; Li, Q; Courtine, G; McEwan, WA; Dehay, B; Bezard, E; Planche, V"

Structural and functional alterations in cerebral small vessel disease: an ALE-based meta-analysis.,"Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is one of the most important causes of stroke and dementia. Although increasing studies have reported alterations of brain structural or neuronal functional activity exhibited in patients with CSVD, it is still unclear which alterations are reliable. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to establish which brain structural or neuronal functional activity changes in those studies were consistent. Activation likelihood estimation revealed that changes in neuronal functional activity in the left angular gyrus, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex/left medial prefrontal cortex, right rolandic operculum, and alterations of gray structure in the left insular cortex/superior temporal gyrus/claustrum were reliable in sporadic CSVD. Decreased neuronal functional activity in the caudate head, anterior cingulate cortex, and reduced gray matter volume in the insular cortex/superior temporal gyrus/claustrum were associated with CSVD-related cognitive impairment. Furthermore, unlike sporadic CSVD, the reliable alterations of neuronal functional activity in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy were concentrated in the left parahippocampal gyrus. The current study presents stable brain structural and neuronal functional abnormalities within the brain, which can help further understand the pathogenesis of CSVD and CSVD-cognitive impairment and provide an index to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment protocols.",2023,activation likelihood estimation; cerebral small vessel disease; cognition; morphometric alteration; neuronal functional activity,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Gray Matter; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases,"Li, Y; Liu, X; Jia, X; Li, H; Jia, X; Yang, Q"

Neuroimaging and verbal memory assessment in healthy aging adults using a portable low-field MRI scanner and a web-based platform: results from a proof-of-concept population-based cross-section study.,"Consumer wearables and health monitors, internet-based health and cognitive assessments, and at-home biosample (e.g., saliva and capillary blood) collection kits are increasingly used by public health researchers for large population-based studies without requiring intensive in-person visits. Alongside reduced participant time burden, remote and virtual data collection allows the participation of individuals who live long distances from hospital or university research centers, or who lack access to transportation. Unfortunately, studies that include magnetic resonance neuroimaging are challenging to perform remotely given the infrastructure requirements of MRI scanners, and, as a result, they often omit socially, economically, and educationally disadvantaged individuals. Lower field strength systems (< 100 mT) offer the potential to perform neuroimaging at a participant's home, enabling more accessible and equitable research. Here we report the first use of a low-field MRI ""scan van"" with an online assessment of paired-associate learning (PAL) to examine associations between brain morphometry and verbal memory performance. In a sample of 67 individuals, 18-93 years of age, imaged at or near their home, we show expected white and gray matter volume trends with age and find significant (p < 0.05 FWE) associations between PAL performance and hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, and thalamic volumes. High-quality data were acquired in 93% of individuals, and at-home scanning was preferred by all individuals with prior MRI at a hospital or research setting. Results demonstrate the feasibility of remote neuroimaging and cognitive data collection, with important implications for engaging traditionally under-represented communities in neuroimaging research.",2023,"Brain MRI; Dementia; Diversity in health research; Low-field MRI; Remote data collection, aging; Web-based cognitive assessment",Humans; Adult; Brain; Healthy Aging; Cognition; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging,"Deoni, SCL; Burton, P; Beauchemin, J; Cano-Lorente, R; De Both, MD; Johnson, M; Ryan, L; Huentelman, MJ"

A Mini-Review of Strategies for Recruiting Older African Americans to Alzheimer's Disease Research.,"African Americans experience higher incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, they continue to be underrepresented in AD research, limiting the ability to generalize findings to the increasingly diverse US population. To reduce AD disparities, targeted efforts are needed to increase the representation of African Americans in AD research. This mini review identified evidence-based strategies that increased research participation among older African Americans. Four recruitment strategies emerged from eight published peer-reviewed studies that directly evaluated the effectiveness of strategies aimed at increasing the number of African American participants in Alzheimer's research. The strategies include community outreach and education, face-to-face discussions, remote access, and referral and partnership with local organizations. Across different locations, these strategies increased the number of African Americans enrolled into AD research, the number of people that signed up to donate their brains for AD research upon death, and the knowledge and perception of AD in the communities. Targeted efforts are effective in increasing AD research participation among older African Americans, especially when combined with approaches that emphasize transparency and mutual trust and involve the community as stakeholders in the research process.",2024,"alzheimer’s; black; clinical trials; dementia; recruitment, and aging",Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Black or African American; Patient Selection; Aged; Biomedical Research; United States; Community-Institutional Relations,"Esiaka, D; Yarborough, CC; Fausto, BA; Gluck, MA"

Transcriptomic Profiling Reveals Discrete Poststroke Dementia Neuronal and Gliovascular Signatures.,"Poststroke dementia (PSD) is associated with pathology in frontal brain regions, in particular dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) neurons and white matter, remote from the infarct. We hypothesised that PSD results from progressive DLPFC neuronal damage, associated with frontal white matter gliovascular unit (GVU) alterations. We investigated the transcriptomic profile of the neurons and white matter GVU cells previously implicated in pathology. Laser-capture microdissected neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells were obtained from the Cognitive Function After Stroke cohort of control, PSD and poststroke non-dementia (PSND) human subjects. Gene expression was assessed using microarrays and pathway analysis to compare changes in PSD with controls and PSND. Neuronal findings were validated using NanoString technology and compared with those in the bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model. Comparing changes in PSD compared to controls with changes in PSND compared to controls identified transcriptomic changes associated specifically with dementia. DLPFC neurons showed defects in energy production (tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding and mitochondria), signalling and communication (MAPK signalling, Toll-like receptor signalling, endocytosis). Similar changes were identified in neurons isolated from BCAS mice. Neuronal findings accompanied by altered astrocyte communication and endothelium immune changes in the frontal white matter, suggesting GVU dysfunction. We propose a pathogenic model in PSD whereby neuronal changes are associated with frontal white matter GVU dysfunction leading to astrocyte failure in supporting neuronal circuits resulting in delayed cognitive decline associated with PSD. Therefore, targeting these processes could potentially ameliorate the dementia seen in PSD.",2023,Gliovascular unit; Neurons; Poststroke dementia; Transcriptome; Vascular dementia,Humans; Animals; Mice; Transcriptome; Endothelial Cells; Brain; Stroke; Neurons,"Waller, R; Hase, Y; Simpson, JE; Heath, PR; Wyles, M; Kalaria, RN; Wharton, SB"

Microanatomical study of pyramidal neurons in the contralesional somatosensory cortex after experimental ischemic stroke.,"At present, many studies support the notion that after stroke, remote regions connected to the infarcted area are also affected and may contribute to functional outcome. In the present study, we have analyzed possible microanatomical alterations in pyramidal neurons from the contralesional hemisphere after induced stroke. We performed intracellular injections of Lucifer yellow in pyramidal neurons from layer III in the somatosensory cortex of the contralesional hemisphere in an ischemic stroke mouse model. A detailed 3-dimensional analysis of the neuronal complexity and morphological alterations of dendritic spines was then performed. Our results demonstrate that pyramidal neurons from layer III in the somatosensory cortex of the contralesional hemisphere show selective changes in their dendritic arbors, namely, less dendritic complexity of the apical dendritic arbor-but no changes in the basal dendritic arbor. In addition, we found differences in spine morphology in both apical and basal dendrites comparing the contralesional hemisphere with the lesional hemisphere. Our results show that pyramidal neurons of remote areas connected to the infarct zone exhibit a series of selective changes in neuronal complexity and morphological distribution of dendritic spines, supporting the hypothesis that remote regions connected to the peri-infarcted area are also affected after stroke.",2023,cerebral cortex; dendritic spines; intracellular injections; neuronal complexity; tMCAo,Mice; Animals; Somatosensory Cortex; Ischemic Stroke; Pyramidal Cells; Neurons; Dendrites; Stroke,"Merino-Serrais, P; Plaza-Alonso, S; Hellal, F; Valero-Freitag, S; Kastanauskaite, A; Muñoz, A; Plesnila, N; DeFelipe, J"

Assessing prospective and retrospective metacognitive accuracy following traumatic brain injury remotely across cognitive domains.,"The ability to monitor one's behaviour is frequently impaired following TBI, impacting on patients' rehabilitation. Inaccuracies in judgement or self-reflection of one's performance provides a useful marker of metacognition. However, metacognition is rarely measured during routine neuropsychology assessments and how it varies across cognitive domains is unclear. A cohort of participants consisting of 111 TBI patients [mean age = 45.32(14.15), female = 29] and 84 controls [mean age = 31.51(12.27), female = 43] was studied. Participants completed cognitive assessments via a bespoke digital platform on their smartphones. Included in the assessment were a prospective evaluation of memory and attention, and retrospective confidence judgements of task performance. Metacognitive accuracy was calculated from the difference between confidence judgement of task performance and actual performance. Prospective judgment of attention and memory was correlated with task performance in these domains for controls but not patients. TBI patients had lower task performance in processing speed, executive functioning and working memory compared to controls, maintaining high confidence, resulting in overestimation of cognitive performance compared to controls. Additional judgments of task performance complement neuropsychological assessments with little additional time-cost. These results have important theoretical and practical implications for evaluation of metacognitive impairment in TBI patients and neurorehabilitation.",2023,Traumatic brain injury; memory; metacognition; processing speed; remote cognitive assessment; self-awareness,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Metacognition; Retrospective Studies; Executive Function; Judgment; Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Bourke, NJ; Trender, W; Hampshire, A; Lai, H; Demarchi, C; David, M; Hellyer, P; Sharp, DJ; Friedland, D"
