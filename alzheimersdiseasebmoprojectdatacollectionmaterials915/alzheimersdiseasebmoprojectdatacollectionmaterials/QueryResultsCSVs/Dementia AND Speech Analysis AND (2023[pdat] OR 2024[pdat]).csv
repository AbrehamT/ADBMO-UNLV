Cerebrospinal fluid HIV RNA escape syndrome.,"A 54-year-old man with treated HIV developed a subacute deterioration of speech, mobility and cognition. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a raised protein and a discordant CSF HIV RNA paired with plasma HIV RNA, confirming the diagnosis of CSF HIV RNA escape syndrome. It is important to consider this diagnosis in people with treated HIV who develop new neurological symptoms.",2024,AIDS; CSF; DEMENTIA; MEDICINE; NEUROVIROLOGY,,"Nasse, S; Underwood, J; Hughes, TAT"
The contribution of short-term memory for sound features to speech-in-noise perception and cognition.,"Speech-in-noise (SIN) perception is a fundamental ability that declines with aging, as does general cognition. We assess whether auditory cognitive ability, in particular short-term memory for sound features, contributes to both. We examined how auditory memory for fundamental sound features, the carrier frequency and amplitude modulation rate of modulated white noise, contributes to SIN perception. We assessed SIN in 153 healthy participants with varying degrees of hearing loss using measures that require single-digit perception (the Digits-in-Noise, DIN) and sentence perception (Speech-in-Babble, SIB). Independent variables were auditory memory and a range of other factors including the Pure Tone Audiogram (PTA), a measure of dichotic pitch-in-noise perception (Huggins pitch), and demographic variables including age and sex. Multiple linear regression models were compared using Bayesian Model Comparison. The best predictor model for DIN included PTA and Huggins pitch (r",2024,Aging; Cognition; Hearing; Memory; Speech-in-Noise,,"Lad, M; Taylor, JP; Griffiths, TD"
Macro and micro structural preservation of grey matter integrity after 24 weeks of rTMS in Alzheimer's disease patients: a pilot study.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by structural and functional dysfunction involving the Default Mode Network (DMN), for which the Precuneus (PC) is a key node. We proposed a randomized double-blind pilot study to determine neurobiological changes after 24 weeks of PC-rTMS in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Sixteen patients were randomly assigned to SHAM or PC-rTMS, and received an intensive 2-weeks course with daily rTMS sessions, followed by a maintenance phase in which rTMS has been applied once a week. Before and after the treatment structural and functional MRIs were collected. Our results showed macro- and micro-structural preservation in PC-rTMS compared to SHAM-rTMS group after 24 weeks of treatment, correlated to an increase of functional connectivity (FC) within the PC in the PC-rTMS group. Even if preliminary, these results trigger the possibility of using PC-rTMS to arrest atrophy progression by manipulating distributed network connectivity patterns.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Brain plasticity; Cortex; Default mode network; Microstructural; Precuneus; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Pilot Projects; Male; Female; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Gray Matter; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Parietal Lobe,"Mencarelli, L; Torso, M; Borghi, I; Assogna, M; Pezzopane, V; Bonnì, S; Di Lorenzo, F; Santarnecchi, E; Giove, F; Martorana, A; Bozzali, M; Ridgway, GR; Chance, SA; Koch, G"
Artificial intelligence classifies primary progressive aphasia from connected speech.,"Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best divided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this cross-sectional study, we first harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform unsupervised classification of short, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Large Language Models (LLMs) discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. In the subsequent supervised classification, seventeen distinctive features emerged, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of short, connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in classifying the four groups (three PPA variants and healthy controls). The data-driven section of this study showcases the ability of LLMs to find natural partitioning in the speech of patients with PPA consistent with conventional variants. In addition, the work identifies a robust set of language features indicative of each PPA variant, emphasizing the significance of dividing verbs into high and low-frequency categories. Beyond improving diagnostic accuracy, these findings enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of language processing.",2024,data-driven classification; generative artificial intelligence; primary progressive aphasia (PPA); theory-driven classification; verb frequency,,"Rezaii, N; Hochberg, D; Quimby, M; Wong, B; Brickhouse, M; Touroutoglou, A; Dickerson, BC; Wolff, P"

Machine Learning Approaches for Dementia Detection Through Speech and Gait Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review.,Dementia is a general term for several progressive neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Timely and accurate detection is crucial for early intervention.

Automated free speech analysis reveals distinct markers of Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.,"Dementia can disrupt how people experience and describe events as well as their own role in them. Alzheimer's disease (AD) compromises the processing of entities expressed by nouns, while behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) entails a depersonalized perspective with increased third-person references. Yet, no study has examined whether these patterns can be captured in connected speech via natural language processing tools. To tackle such gaps, we asked 96 participants (32 AD patients, 32 bvFTD patients, 32 healthy controls) to narrate a typical day of their lives and calculated the proportion of nouns, verbs, and first- or third-person markers (via part-of-speech and morphological tagging). We also extracted objective properties (frequency, phonological neighborhood, length, semantic variability) from each content word. In our main study (with 21 AD patients, 21 bvFTD patients, and 21 healthy controls), we used inferential statistics and machine learning for group-level and subject-level discrimination. The above linguistic features were correlated with patients' scores in tests of general cognitive status and executive functions. We found that, compared with HCs, (i) AD (but not bvFTD) patients produced significantly fewer nouns, (ii) bvFTD (but not AD) patients used significantly more third-person markers, and (iii) both patient groups produced more frequent words. Machine learning analyses showed that these features identified individuals with AD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.71). A generalizability test, with a model trained on the entire main study sample and tested on hold-out samples (11 AD patients, 11 bvFTD patients, 11 healthy controls), showed even better performance, with AUCs of 0.76 and 0.83 for AD and bvFTD, respectively. No linguistic feature was significantly correlated with cognitive test scores in either patient group. These results suggest that specific cognitive traits of each disorder can be captured automatically in connected speech, favoring interpretability for enhanced syndrome characterization, diagnosis, and monitoring.",2024,,Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; Speech; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Biomarkers; Natural Language Processing; Machine Learning; Neuropsychological Tests; Executive Function,"Lopes da Cunha, P; Ruiz, F; Ferrante, F; Sterpin, LF; Ibáñez, A; Slachevsky, A; Matallana, D; Martínez, Á; Hesse, E; García, AM"

Non-pharmacological interventions for improving language and communication in people with primary progressive aphasia.,"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) accounts for approximately 43% of frontotemporal dementias and is mainly characterised by a progressive impairment of speech and communication abilities. Three clinical variants have been identified: (a) non-fluent/agrammatic, (b) semantic, and (c) logopenic/phonological PPA variants. There is currently no curative treatment for PPA, and the disease progresses inexorably over time, with devastating effects on speech and communication ability, functional status, and quality of life. Several non-pharmacological interventions that may improve symptoms (e.g. different forms of language training and non-invasive brain stimulation) have been investigated in people with PPA.",2024,,"Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Bias; Cognition; Communication; Language; Language Therapy; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Roheger, M; Riemann, S; Brauer, A; McGowan, E; Grittner, U; Flöel, A; Meinzer, M"

Actual Clinical Practice Assessment: A Rapid and Easy-to-Use Tool for Evaluating Cognitive Decline Equivalent to Dementia.,"Background Screening tests reveal the early signs of cognitive decline, enabling better self-care and preparation for the future. We developed and evaluated the accuracy of a rapid (20 s) and easy-to-use tool called ONSEI, assessing the cognitive decline equivalent to dementia in actual clinical practice by correlating clinical diagnoses with the ONSEI classification. Methods In this retrospective observational study, data were collected from individuals who visited three neurosurgical clinics in neighboring prefectures of Tokyo, Japan. ONSEI analysis was performed using a smartphone or tablet. The tool adopts a machine-learning algorithm using the speaker's age, time-orientation task score, and acoustic features of spoken responses to that task. Significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated by Fisher's exact test. Results The overall classification accuracy of ONSEI was 98.1% (p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 97.3% (p<0.001) and 98.5% (p<0.001), respectively. The proportion of correct classifications was consistent across different age groups. Conclusion ONSEI showed high classification accuracy for dementia in cognitively normal individuals in actual clinical practice, regardless of the facility at which the tests were conducted or the age of the participants. Thus, ONSEI can be useful for dementia screening and self-care.",2024,automated classification; dementia; digital cognitive assessment; machine learning; speech features,,"Asano, T; Yasuda, A; Kinoshita, S; Nomoto, J; Kato, T; Suzuki, C; Suzuki, H; Kinoshita, T; Shigeta, M; Homma, A"

COS-PPA: protocol to develop a core outcome set for primary progressive aphasia.,"The term primary progressive aphasia (PPA) describes a group of language-led dementias. Disease-modifying treatments that delay, slow or reverse progression of PPA are currently lacking, though a number of interventions to manage the symptoms of PPA have been developed in recent years. Unfortunately, studies exploring the effectiveness of these interventions have used a variety of different outcome measures, limiting comparability. There are more constructs, apart from word retrieval, that are important for people with PPA that have not received much attention in the research literature. Existing core outcome sets (COS) for dementia and non-progressive aphasia do not meet the needs of people with PPA, highlighting a need to develop a specific COS for PPA.",2024,dementia; patient reported outcome measures; speech pathology,"Humans; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Research Design; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Delphi Technique; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Consensus","Volkmer, A; Copland, DA; Henry, ML; Warren, JD; Varley, R; Wallace, SJ; Hardy, CJ"
Clinical Review of Juvenile Huntington's Disease.," Juvenile Huntington's disease (JHD) is rare. In the first decade of life speech difficulties, rigidity, and dystonia are common clinical motor symptoms, whereas onset in the second decade motor symptoms may sometimes resemble adult-onset Huntington's disease (AOHD). Cognitive decline is mostly detected by declining school performances. Behavioral symptoms in general do not differ from AOHD but may be confused with autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and lead to misdiagnosis and/or diagnostic delay. JHD specific features are epilepsy, ataxia, spasticity, pain, itching, and possibly liver steatosis. Disease progression of JHD is faster compared to AOHD and the disease duration is shorter, particularly in case of higher CAG repeat lengths. The diagnosis is based on clinical judgement in combination with a positive family history and/or DNA analysis after careful consideration. Repeat length in JHD is usually > 55 and caused by anticipation, usually via paternal transmission. There are no pharmacological and multidisciplinary guidelines for JHD treatment. Future perspectives for earlier diagnosis are better diagnostic markers such as qualitative MRI and neurofilament light in serum.",2024,,Humans; Huntington Disease; Adolescent; Child; Disease Progression; Age of Onset,"Oosterloo, M; Touze, A; Byrne, LM; Achenbach, J; Aksoy, H; Coleman, A; Lammert, D; Nance, M; Nopoulos, P; Reilmann, R; Saft, C; Santini, H; Squitieri, F; Tabrizi, S; Burgunder, JM; Quarrell, O"

Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD. Our new smartphone test, TapTalk, combines analysis of hand and speech-like movements to detect AD risk. This study aims to [1] determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately predict preclinical AD [2], determine usability, reliability, and validity of TapTalk in cognitively asymptomatic older adults and [3], prospectively validate TapTalk in older adults who have cognitive symptoms against cognitive tests and clinical diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Dementia; Diadochokinesis; Digital biomarker; Finger-tapping; Kinematics; Multimodal; TAS Test; TapTalk,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Alty, J; Goldberg, LR; Roccati, E; Lawler, K; Bai, Q; Huang, G; Bindoff, AD; Li, R; Wang, X; St George, RJ; Rudd, K; Bartlett, L; Collins, JM; Aiyede, M; Fernando, N; Bhagwat, A; Giffard, J; Salmon, K; McDonald, S; King, AE; Vickers, JC"

Clinical and neuroimaging characterization of the first frontotemporal dementia family carrying the MAPT p.K298E mutation.,"We present an in-depth clinical and neuroimaging analysis of a family carrying the MAPT K298E mutation associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Initial identification of this mutation in a single clinical case led to a comprehensive investigation involving four affected siblings allowing to elucidate the mutation's phenotypic expression.A 60-year-old male presented with significant behavioral changes and progressed rapidly, exhibiting speech difficulties and cognitive decline. Neuroimaging via FDG-PET revealed asymmetrical frontotemporal hypometabolism. Three siblings subsequently showed varied but consistent clinical manifestations, including abnormal behavior, speech impairments, memory deficits, and motor symptoms correlating with asymmetric frontotemporal atrophy observed in MRI scans.Based on the genotype-phenotype correlation, we propose that the p.K298E mutation results in early-onset behavioral variant FTD, accompanied by a various constellation of speech and motor impairment.This detailed characterization expands the understanding of the p.K298E mutation's clinical and neuroimaging features, underlining its role in the pathogenesis of FTD.

A new schizophrenia screening instrument based on evaluating the patient's writing.,"Formal Thought Disorder (FTD) is a defining feature of schizophrenia, which is often assessed through patients' speech. Meanwhile, the written language is less studied. The aim of the present study is to establish and validate a comprehensive clinical screening scale, capturing the full variety of empirical characteristics of writing in patients with schizophrenia. The 16-item Screening Instrument for Schizophrenic Features in Writing (SISFiW) is derived from detailed literature review and a ""brainstorming"" discussion on 30 samples written by patients with schizophrenia. One hundred and fifty-seven participants (114 patients with an ICD-10 diagnoses of schizophrenia; 43 healthy control subjects) were interviewed and symptoms assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language, and Communication (TLC). Article samples written by each participant were rated with the SISFiW. Results demonstrated significant difference of the SISFiW-total between the patient group and healthy controls [(3.61 ± 1.72) vs. (0.49 ± 0.63), t = 16.64, p<0.001]. The inter-rater reliability (weighted kappa = 0.72) and the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.613) were acceptable, but correlations with the criterion (PANSS and TLC) were unremarkable. The ROC analysis indicated a cutoff point at 2 with the maximal sensitivity (93.0 %)/specificity (93.0 %). Discriminant analysis of the SISFiW items yielded 8 classifiers that discriminated between the diagnostic groups at a perfect overall performance (with 90.4 % of original and 88.5 % cross-validated grouped cases classified correctly). This instrument appears to be practicable and reliable, with relatively robust discriminatory power, and may serve as a complementary tool to existing FTD rating scales.",2024,Formal Thought Disorder; Psychometric; Schizophrenia; Screening instrument; Writing,Humans; Schizophrenia; Reproducibility of Results; Frontotemporal Dementia; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Language; Psychometrics,"Peng, Z; Li, Q; Liu, X; Zhang, H; Ran, M; Liu, M; Tan, X; Stein, MJ"

Discriminating nonfluent/agrammatic and logopenic PPA variants with automatically extracted morphosyntactic measures from connected speech.,"Morphosyntactic assessments are important for characterizing individuals with nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA). Yet, standard tests are subject to examiner bias and often fail to differentiate between nfvPPA and logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA). Moreover, relevant neural signatures remain underexplored. Here, we leverage natural language processing tools to automatically capture morphosyntactic disturbances and their neuroanatomical correlates in 35 individuals with nfvPPA relative to 10 healthy controls (HC) and 26 individuals with lvPPA. Participants described a picture, and ensuing transcripts were analyzed via part-of-speech tagging to extract sentence-related features (e.g., subordinating and coordinating conjunctions), verbal-related features (e.g., tense markers), and nominal-related features (e.g., subjective and possessive pronouns). Gradient boosting machines were used to classify between groups using all features. We identified the most discriminant morphosyntactic marker via a feature importance algorithm and examined its neural correlates via voxel-based morphometry. Individuals with nfvPPA produced fewer morphosyntactic elements than the other two groups. Such features robustly discriminated them from both individuals with lvPPA and HCs with an AUC of .95 and .82, respectively. The most discriminatory feature corresponded to subordinating conjunctions was correlated with cortical atrophy within the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus across groups (p",2024,Cortical atrophy; Morphosyntax; Natural language processing; Primary progressive aphasia; Subordination production,"Humans; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Speech; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Language; Atrophy","Lukic, S; Fan, Z; García, AM; Welch, AE; Ratnasiri, BM; Wilson, SM; Henry, ML; Vonk, J; Deleon, J; Miller, BL; Miller, Z; Mandelli, ML; Gorno-Tempini, ML"

Connected speech features in non-English speakers with Alzheimer's disease: protocol for scoping review.,"A large body of literature indicates that connected speech profiles in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be utilized for diagnosis, disease monitoring, and for developing communication strategies for patients. Most connected speech research has been conducted in English, with little work in some European languages. Therefore, significant drawback remains with respect to the diversity of languages studied, and how the fragmentation of linguistic features differs across languages in AD. Accordingly, existing reviews on connected speech in AD have focused on findings from English-speaking patients; none have specifically focused on the linguistic diversity of AD populations. This scoping review is undertaken to provide the currently reported characteristics of connected speech in AD in languages other than English. It also seeks to identify the type of assessments, methods to elicit speech samples, type of analysis and linguistic frameworks used, and micro- and macro-linguistic features of speech reported in non-English speakers with AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Connected speech analysis; Dementia; Grammar; Lexicon; Narrative; Naturalistic speech; Spontaneous speech; Syntax,Humans; Speech; Alzheimer Disease; Language; Linguistics; Review Literature as Topic,"Bose, A; Ahmed, S; Cheng, Y; Suárez-Gonzalez, A"

DDQ anti-aging properties expressed with improved mitophagy in mutant tau HT22 neuronal cells.,"The purpose of our study is to develop age-related phosphorylated tau (p-tau) inhibitors, for Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are wide-ranging therapeutic molecules available in the market and tested for age-related p-tau inhibition to enhance phosphatase activity and microtubule stability in AD neurons. Until now there are no such small molecules claimed to show promising results to delay the disease process of AD. However, a recently developed molecule, DDQ, has been shown to reduce abnormal protein-protein interactions and protect neurons from mutant protein-induced toxicities in the disease process. In addition, DDQ reduced age- and Aβ-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic toxicity. To date, there are no published reports on the p-tau interaction of DDQ and Sirt3 upregulation with CREB-mediated mitophagy activation in AD neurons. In the current study, HT22 cells were transfected with mutant Tau (mTau) cDNA and treated with the novel molecule DDQ. Cell survival, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analysis were conducted to assess cell viability and synaptic and mitophagy proteins in treated and untreated cell groups. As expected, we found cell survival was decreased in mTau-HT22 cells when compared with control HT22 cells. However, cell survival was increased in DDQ-treated mTau-HT22 cells when compared with mTau HT22 cells. P-tau and total tau proteins were significantly reduced in DDQ-treated mTau-HT22 cells, and MAP2 levels were increased. Anti-aging proteins like Sirt3, and CREB levels were increased in DDQ-treated HT22 cells and also in mTau-HT22 cells treated DDQ. Mitophagy proteins were decreased in mTau-HT22 cells and these were increased in DDQ-treated mTau-HT22 cells. These observations strongly suggest that DDQ has anti-p-tau and anti-aging properties, via Sirt3 overexpression and increased mitophagy proteins. Our study findings may have implications for healthy aging to the development of p-tau targeted therapeutics in AD and tauopathies.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Anti-aging; DDQ; Mitophagy; Sirt3,Humans; tau Proteins; Mitophagy; Sirtuin 3; Alzheimer Disease; Neurons; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Pradeepkiran, JA; Rawat, P; Reddy, AP; Orlov, E; Reddy, PH"
Evidence for the factor structure of formal thought disorder: A systematic review.,"Disorganised speech, or, formal thought disorder (FTD), is considered one of the core features of psychosis, yet its factor structure remains debated. This systematic review aimed to identify the core dimensions of FTD. In line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic review was conducted on the FTD factor analytic literature. Sixteen studies were identified from PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science between October 1971 and January 2023. Across the 39 factor analyses investigated, findings demonstrated the prominence of a three-factor structure. Broad agreement was found for two factors within the three-factor model, which were typically referred to as disorganisation and negative, with the exact nature of the third dimension requiring further clarification. The quality assessment revealed some methodological challenges relating to the assessment of FTD and conducted factor analyses. Future research should clarify the exact nature of the third dimension across different patient groups and methodologies to determine whether a consistent transdiagnostic concept of FTD can be elucidated.",2024,Dimension reduction; Dimensionality; Factor analysis; Language; Psychosis,Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Psychotic Disorders; Communication Disorders,"Zamperoni, G; Tan, EJ; Rossell, SL; Meyer, D; Sumner, PJ"
Using Generative Artificial Intelligence to Classify Primary Progressive Aphasia from Connected Speech.,"Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.",2023,,,"Rezaii, N; Quimby, M; Wong, B; Hochberg, D; Brickhouse, M; Touroutoglou, A; Dickerson, BC; Wolff, P"

Proxy-analysis of the genetics of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease through polygenic scores.,"Cognitive decline is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its genetic risk factors are not well known to date, besides variants in the GBA and APOE genes. However, variation in complex traits is caused by numerous variants and is usually studied with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), requiring a large sample size, which is difficult to achieve for outcome measures in PD. Taking an alternative approach, we computed 100 polygenic scores (PGS) related to cognitive, dementia, stroke, and brain anatomical phenotypes and investigated their association with cognitive decline in six longitudinal cohorts. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, genetic ancestry, follow-up duration, GBA and APOE status. Then, we meta-analyzed five of these cohorts, comprising a total of 1702 PD participants with 6156 visits, using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment as a cognitive outcome measure. After correction for multiple comparisons, we found four PGS significantly associated with cognitive decline: intelligence (p = 5.26e-13), cognitive performance (p = 1.46e-12), educational attainment (p = 8.52e-10), and reasoning (p = 3.58e-5). Survival analyses highlighted an offset of several years between the first and last quartiles of PGS, with significant differences for the PGS of cognitive performance (5 years) and educational attainment (7 years). In conclusion, we found four PGS associated with cognitive decline in PD, all associated with general cognitive phenotypes.

Subject Harmonization of Digital Biomarkers: Improved Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the early stage of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a crucial stage for therapeutic interventions and treatment. Early detection of MCI offers opportunities for early intervention and significantly benefits cohort enrichment for clinical trials. Imaging and in vivo markers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have high detection performance, yet their prohibitive costs and intrusiveness demand more affordable and accessible alternatives. The recent advances in digital biomarkers, especially language markers, have shown great potential, where variables informative to MCI are derived from linguistic and/or speech and later used for predictive modeling. A major challenge in modeling language markers comes from the variability of how each person speaks. As the cohort size for language studies is usually small due to extensive data collection efforts, the variability among persons makes language markers hard to generalize to unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel subject harmonization tool to address the issue of distributional differences in language markers across subjects, thus enhancing the generalization performance of machine learning models. Our empirical results show that machine learning models built on our harmonized features have improved prediction performance on unseen data.

A systematic review and narrative analysis of digital speech biomarkers in Motor Neuron Disease.,"Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a progressive and largely fatal neurodegeneritve disorder with a lifetime risk of approximately 1 in 300. At diagnosis, up to 25% of people with MND (pwMND) exhibit bulbar dysfunction. Currently, pwMND are assessed using clinical examination and diagnostic tools including the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALS-FRS(R)), a clinician-administered questionnaire with a single item on speech intelligibility. Here we report on the use of digital technologies to assess speech features as a marker of disease diagnosis and progression in pwMND. Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline and EMBASE were systematically searched. 40 studies were evaluated including 3670 participants; 1878 with a diagnosis of MND. 24 studies used microphones, 5 used smartphones, 6 used apps, 2 used tape recorders and 1 used the Multi-Dimensional Voice Programme (MDVP) to record speech samples. Data extraction and analysis methods varied but included traditional statistical analysis, CSpeech, MATLAB and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Speech features assessed also varied and included jitter, shimmer, fundamental frequency, intelligible speaking rate, pause duration and syllable repetition. Findings from this systematic review indicate that digital speech biomarkers can distinguish pwMND from healthy controls and can help identify bulbar involvement in pwMND. Preliminary evidence suggests digitally assessed acoustic features can identify more nuanced changes in those affected by voice dysfunction. No one digital speech biomarker alone is consistently able to diagnose or prognosticate MND. Further longitudinal studies involving larger samples are required to validate the use of these technologies as diagnostic tools or prognostic biomarkers.",2023,,,"Bowden, M; Beswick, E; Tam, J; Perry, D; Smith, A; Newton, J; Chandran, S; Watts, O; Pal, S"

Reorganization of the cortical connectome functional gradient in age-related hearing loss.,"Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), one of the most common sensory deficits in elderly individuals, is a risk factor for dementia; however, it is unclear how ARHL affects the decline in cognitive function. To address this issue, a connectome gradient framework was used to identify critical features of information integration between sensory and cognitive processing centers using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 40 individuals with ARHL and 36 healthy controls (HCs). The first three functional gradient alterations associated with ARHL were investigated at the global, network and regional levels. Using a support vector machine (SVM) model, our analysis distinguished individuals with ARHL with normal cognitive function from those with cognitive decline. Compared to HCs, individuals with ARHL had a contracted principal primary-to-transmodal gradient axis, especially in the visual and default mode networks, with an altered gradient explained ratio and variance. Among individuals with ARHL, cognitive decline was detected in the visual network in the principal gradient as well as in the limbic, salience and default mode networks in the third gradient (salience to frontoparietal/default mode). These results suggest that ARHL is associated with disrupted information processing from the primary sensory networks to higher-order cognitive networks and highlight the key nodes closely associated with cognitive decline during cognitive processing in ARHL, providing new insights into the mechanism of cognitive impairment and suggesting potential treatments related to ARHL.",2023,Age-related hearing loss; Cognitive decline; Cortical gradient; fMRI,Humans; Aged; Connectome; Cognitive Dysfunction; Presbycusis; Cognition; Risk Factors; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Tong, Z; Zhang, J; Xing, C; Xu, X; Wu, Y; Salvi, R; Yin, X; Zhao, F; Chen, YC; Cai, Y"

Clinical dimensions along the non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia spectrum.,"It is debated whether primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) and progressive agrammatic aphasia (PAA) belong to the same clinical spectrum, traditionally termed non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), or exist as two completely distinct syndromic entities with specific pathologic/prognostic correlates. We analysed speech, language and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g. PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with aetiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated using linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS and six PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by non-fluent speech, executive dysfunction and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between frontotemporal lobar degeneration neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (0.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance [(i) severity-agrammatism; (ii) prominent AOS; and (iii) prominent dysarthria]. None of these data-driven LCDs allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",2024,apraxia of speech; corticobasal degeneration; dysarthria; magnetic resonance imaging; primary progressive aphasia; progressive supranuclear palsy,"Humans; Aphasia, Broca; Dysarthria; Apraxias; Language; Speech; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Primary Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia","Illán-Gala, I; Lorca-Puls, DL; Tee, BL; Ezzes, Z; de Leon, J; Miller, ZA; Rubio-Guerra, S; Santos-Santos, M; Gómez-Andrés, D; Grinberg, LT; Spina, S; Kramer, JH; Wauters, LD; Henry, ML; Boxer, AL; Rosen, HJ; Miller, BL; Seeley, WW; Mandelli, ML; Gorno-Tempini, ML"

The role of RLIP76 in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction: Evidence based on autopsy brains from Alzheimer's disease patients.,"Several converging lines of evidence from our group support a potential role of RLIP76 (AKA Rlip) in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the role of Rlip in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. The purpose of the present study is to determine the role of Rlip in the brains of AD patients and control subjects. To achieve our goals, we used frozen tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded postmortem brains from AD patients of different Braak stages and age-matched control subjects. Our immunohistology and immunoblotting blotting analysis revealed that expression of Rlip protein gradually and significantly decreased (p = 0.0001) with AD progression, being lowest in Braak stage IV-V.

Artificial Emotional Intelligence in Socially Assistive Robots for Older Adults: A Pilot Study.,"This paper presents our recent research on integrating artificial emotional intelligence in a social robot (Ryan) and studies the robot's effectiveness in engaging older adults. Ryan is a socially assistive robot designed to provide companionship for older adults with depression and dementia through conversation. We used two versions of Ryan for our study, empathic and non-empathic. The empathic Ryan utilizes a multimodal emotion recognition algorithm and a multimodal emotion expression system. Using different input modalities for emotion, i.e. facial expression and speech sentiment, the empathic Ryan detects users emotional state and utilizes an affective dialogue manager to generate a response. On the other hand, the non-empathic Ryan lacks facial expression and uses scripted dialogues that do not factor in the users emotional state. We studied these two versions of Ryan with 10 older adults living in a senior care facility. The statistically significant improvement in the users' reported face-scale mood measurement indicates an overall positive effect from the interaction with both the empathic and non-empathic versions of Ryan. However, the number of spoken words measurement and the exit survey analysis suggest that the users perceive the empathic Ryan as more engaging and likable.",2023,Artificial Emotional Intelligence; Dementia and Depression; Emotion Recognition; Social Robotics; empathic robots,,"Abdollahi, H; Mahoor, MH; Zandie, R; Siewierski, J; Qualls, SH"

Atypical TDP-43 proteinopathy clinically presenting with progressive nonfluent aphasia: A case report.,"Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) is a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) caused by tau and transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) accumulation. Here we report the autopsy findings of a 64-year-old right-handed man with an atypical TDP-43 proteinopathy who presented with difficulties with speech, verbal paraphasia, and dysphagia that progressed over the 36 months prior to his death. He did not show pyramidal tract signs until his death. At autopsy, macroscopic brain examination revealed atrophy of the left dominant precentral, superior, and middle frontal gyri and discoloration of the putamen. Spongiform change and neuronal loss were severe on the cortical surfaces of the precentral, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri and the temporal tip. Immunostaining with anti-phosphorylated TDP-43 revealed neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and long and short dystrophic neurites in the frontal cortex, predominantly in layers II, V, and VI of the temporal tip, amygdala, and transentorhinal cortex. Immunoblot analysis of the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions showed hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 bands at 45 kDa and phosphorylated C-terminal fragments at approximately 25 kDa. The pathological distribution and immunoblot band pattern differ from the major TDP-43 subtype and therefore may represent a new FTLD-TDP phenotype.",2024,frontotemporal lobar degeneration; immunoblotting; neuropathology; phosphorylated transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (p‐TDP‐43); progressive nonfluent aphagia,Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Primary Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Frontotemporal Dementia; DNA-Binding Proteins,"Suzuki, Y; Adachi, T; Yoshida, K; Taneda, K; Sakuwa, M; Hasegawa, M; Hanajima, R"

Dissociating memory and executive function impairment through temporal features in a word list verbal learning task.,"The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is an established verbal learning test commonly used to quantify memory impairments due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) both at a clinical dementia stage or prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Focal memory impairment-as quantified e.g. by the RAVLT-at an MCI stage is referred to as amnestic MCI (aMCI) and is often regarded as the cognitive phenotype of prodromal AD. However, recent findings suggest that not only learning and memory but also other cognitive domains, especially executive functions (EF) and processing speed (PS), influence verbal learning performance. This research investigates whether additional temporal features extracted from audio recordings from a participant's RAVLT response can better dissociate memory and EF in such tasks and eventually help to better describe MCI subtypes. 675 age-matched participants from the H70 Swedish birth cohort were included in this analysis; 68 participants were classified as MCI (33 aMCI and 35 due to executive impairment). RAVLT performances were recorded and temporal features extracted. Novel temporal features were correlated with established neuropsychological tests measuring EF and PS. Lastly, the downstream diagnostic potential of temporal features was estimated using group differences and a machine learning (ML) classification scenario. Temporal features correlated moderately with measures of EF and PS. Performance of an ML classifier could be improved by adding temporal features to traditional counts. We conclude that RAVLT temporal features are in general related to EF and that they might be capable of dissociating memory and EF in a word list learning task.",2023,Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; RAVLT; Speech analysis; Temporal analysis; aMCI; exMCI,,"Dörr, F; Schäfer, S; Öhman, F; Linz, N; Bodin, TH; Skoog, J; Zettergren, A; Kern, S; Skoog, I; Tröger, J"
From genetic correlations of Alzheimer's disease to classification with artificial neural network models.,"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder characterized by many risk loci with potential associations with different traits and diseases. AD, characterized by a progressive loss of neuronal functions, manifests with different symptoms such as decline in memory, movement, coordination, and speech. The mechanisms underlying the onset of AD are not always fully understood, but involve a multiplicity of factors. Early diagnosis of AD plays a central role as it can offer the possibility of early treatment, which can slow disease progression. Currently, the methods of diagnosis are cognitive testing, neuroimaging, or cerebrospinal fluid analysis that can be time-consuming, expensive, invasive, and not always accurate. In the present study, we performed a genetic correlation analysis using genome-wide association statistics from a large study of AD and UK Biobank, to examine the association of AD with other human traits and disorders. In addition, since hippocampus, a part of cerebral cortex could play a central role in several traits that are associated with AD; we analyzed the gene expression profiles of hippocampus of AD patients applying 4 different artificial neural network models. We found 65 traits correlated with AD grouped into 9 clusters: medical conditions, fluid intelligence, education, anthropometric measures, employment status, activity, diet, lifestyle, and sexuality. The comparison of different 4 neural network models along with feature selection methods on 5 Alzheimer's gene expression datasets showed that the simple basic neural network model obtains a better performance (66% of accuracy) than other more complex methods with dropout and weight regularization of the network.",2023,Alzheimer; Gene expression; Genetic correlation; Neural network,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Chromosome Mapping; Hippocampus; Neural Networks, Computer","Cava, C; D'Antona, S; Maselli, F; Castiglioni, I; Porro, D"

ADscreen: A speech processing-based screening system for automatic identification of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11 % of older adults in the United States. Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of patients with ADRD, >50 % of them are not diagnosed and unaware of their disease. To address this challenge, we developed ADscreen, an innovative speech-processing based ADRD screening algorithm for the protective identification of patients with ADRD. ADscreen consists of five major components: (i) noise reduction for reducing background noises from the audio-recorded patient speech, (ii) modeling the patient's ability in phonetic motor planning using acoustic parameters of the patient's voice, (iii) modeling the patient's ability in semantic and syntactic levels of language organization using linguistic parameters of the patient speech, (iv) extracting vocal and semantic psycholinguistic cues from the patient speech, and (v) building and evaluating the screening algorithm. To identify important speech parameters (features) associated with ADRD, we used the Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM), an effective feature selection method for high dimensional, small sample size datasets. Modeling the relationship between speech parameters and the outcome variable (presence/absence of ADRD) was conducted using three different machine learning (ML) architectures with the capability of joining informative acoustic and linguistic with contextual word embedding vectors obtained from the DistilBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We evaluated the performance of the ADscreen on an audio-recorded patients' speech (verbal description) for the Cookie-Theft picture description task, which is publicly available in the dementia databank. The joint fusion of acoustic and linguistic parameters with contextual word embedding vectors of DistilBERT achieved F1-score = 84.64 (standard deviation [std] = ±3.58) and AUC-ROC = 92.53 (std = ±3.34) for training dataset, and F1-score = 89.55 and AUC-ROC = 93.89 for the test dataset. In summary, ADscreen has a strong potential to be integrated with clinical workflow to address the need for an ADRD screening tool so that patients with cognitive impairment can receive appropriate and timely care.",2023,Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Screening algorithm; Speech analysis,Aged; Humans; Acoustics; Alzheimer Disease; Linguistics; Speech; Mass Screening,"Zolnoori, M; Zolnour, A; Topaz, M"

A systematic review and metanalysis of questionnaires used for auditory processing screening and evaluation.,"The recognition of Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) as a distinct clinical condition that impacts hearing capacity and mental health has gained attention. Although pure tone audiometry is the gold standard for assessing hearing, it inadequately reflects everyday hearing abilities, especially in challenging acoustic environments. Deficits in speech perception in noise, a key aspect of APD, have been linked to an increased risk of dementia. The World Health Organization emphasizes the need for evaluating central auditory function in cases of mild hearing loss and normal audiometry results. Specific questionnaires play a crucial role in documenting and quantifying the difficulties faced by individuals with APD. Validated questionnaires such as the Children's Auditory Processing Performance Scale, the Fisher's Auditory Problems Checklist, and the Auditory Processing Domains Questionnaire are available for children, while questionnaires for adults include items related to auditory functions associated with APD. This systematic review and meta-analysis identified six questionnaires used for screening and evaluating APD with a total of 783 participants across 12 studies. The questionnaires exhibited differences in domains evaluated, scoring methods, and evaluation of listening in quiet and noise. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that individuals with APD consistently exhibited worse scores compared to healthy controls across all questionnaires. Additionally, comparisons with clinical control groups showed varying results. The study highlights (i) the importance of standardized questionnaires in identifying and assessing APD, aiding in its diagnosis and management, and (ii) the need to use sub-scores as well as overall scores of questionnaires to elaborate on specific hearing and listening situations. There is a need to develop more APD specific questionnaires for the adult population as well as for more focused research on APD diagnosed individuals to further establish the validity and reliability of these questionnaires.",2023,auditory processing; auditory processing disorders; central auditory processing; clinical test battery; hearing; metanalysis; questionnaires; systematic review,,"Samara, M; Thai-Van, H; Ptok, M; Glarou, E; Veuillet, E; Miller, S; Reynard, P; Grech, H; Utoomprurkporn, N; Sereti, A; Bamiou, DE; Iliadou, VM"

Acoustic Analysis and Neuroimaging Correlates of Diadochokinetic Rates in Mild-Moderate Primary Progressive Apraxia of Speech.,"Speech rate can be judged clinically using diadochokinetic (DDK) tasks, such as alternating motion rates (AMR) and sequential motion rates (SMR). We evaluated whether acoustic AMR/SMR speech rates would differentiate primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) from healthy controls, and determined how DDK rates relate to phonetic and prosodic speech characteristics and brain metabolism on FDG-PET. Rate was calculated for each of three AMRs (repetitions of 'puh', 'tuh', and 'kuh') and for SMRs (repetitions of 'puhtuhkuh') for 27 PPAOS patients and 52 controls who underwent FDG-PET. PPAOS patients were slower than controls on all DDK tasks. All DDK rates correlated with apraxia of speech severity, with strongest associations with prosodic speech features. Slower DDK rates were associated with hypometabolism in the right cerebellar dentate and left supplementary motor area. Performance on AMR rate, not just SMR rate, may be impaired in mild PPAOS, but sensitivity and specificity require further study.",2023,Apraxia of speech; PET; acoustic analysis; aphasia; phonetic; prosodic,"Humans; Speech; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Brain; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Apraxias; Neuroimaging; Acoustics","Josephs, KA; Duffy, JR; Martin, PR; Stephens, YC; Singh, NA; Clark, HM; Botha, H; Lowe, VJ; Whitwell, JL; Utianski, RL"
Automated analysis of written language in the three variants of primary progressive aphasia.,"Despite the important role of written language in everyday life, abnormalities in functional written communication have been sparsely investigated in primary progressive aphasia. Prior studies have analysed written language separately in each of the three variants of primary progressive aphasia-but have rarely compared them to each other or to spoken language. Manual analysis of written language can be a time-consuming process. We therefore developed a program that quantifies content units and total units in written or transcribed language samples. We analysed written and spoken descriptions of the Western Aphasia Battery picnic scene, based on a predefined content unit corpus. We calculated the ratio of content units to units as a measure of content density.

Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living for Greek-Speaking Adults with Cognitive Impairment: A Psychometric Evaluation Study with Additional Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Analysis.,"One of the components of a dementia diagnosis is the assessment of functional abilities. These abilities are measured via screeners, such as the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale. The IADL scale is a valid tool that has been adapted in many languages. This study aimed to provide a cut-off point and validate the Greek version of the IADL scale in populations with cognitive impairment. IADL data were collected from 132 individuals: 24 PD patients, 24 Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) patients, and 24 AD patients. The remaining 60 participants were cognitive healthy adults (CHAs). The CHA group and the PD group served as the cognitively unimpaired group (CUG), while the PDD and AD groups served as the cognitively impaired group (CIG). Additionally, the MMSE, the AMTS, the Clock Drawing Test CDT, the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD), the NPI, and the GDS-15 were administered to the participants. Statistically significant differences in the IADL scores were exhibited between all subgroups. The IADL scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.890).

A Multimodal Approach for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Progressive Aphasia (MAINSTREAM): A Study Protocol.,"Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a syndrome due to different neurodegenerative disorders selectively disrupting language functions. PPA specialist care is underdeveloped. There are very few specialists (neurologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and speech therapists) and few hospital- or community-based services dedicated to the diagnosis and continuing care of people with PPA. Currently, healthcare systems struggle to provide adequate coverage of care that is too often fragmented, uncoordinated, and unresponsive to the needs of people with PPA and their families. Recently, attention has been gained by non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that allow a personalized treatment approach, such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The MAINSTREAM trial looks forward to introducing and evaluating therapeutic innovations such as tDCS coupled with language therapy in rehabilitation settings.

Explainable Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Linguistic Features from Automatic Speech Recognition.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia and can cause abnormal cognitive function and progressive loss of essential life skills. Early screening is thus necessary for the prevention and intervention of AD. Speech dysfunction is an early onset symptom of AD patients. Recent studies have demonstrated the promise of automated acoustic assessment using acoustic or linguistic features extracted from speech. However, most previous studies have relied on manual transcription of text to extract linguistic features, which weakens the efficiency of automated assessment. The present study thus investigates the effectiveness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in building an end-to-end automated speech analysis model for AD detection.",2023,ADReSS; Alzheimer’s disease; Automatic speech recognition; Ensemble learning; Linguistic features,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech Perception; Linguistics; Speech; Cognition,"Tang, L; Zhang, Z; Feng, F; Yang, LZ; Li, H"

Urgent needs of caregiving in ageing populations with Alzheimer's disease and other chronic conditions: Support our loved ones.,"The ageing process begins at birth. It is a life-long process, and its exact origins are still unknown. Several hypotheses attempt to describe the normal ageing process, including hormonal imbalance, formation of reactive oxygen species, DNA methylation & DNA damage accumulation, loss of proteostasis, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, senescence, inflammation, and stem cell depletion. With increased lifespan in elderly individuals, the prevalence of age-related diseases including, cancer, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, Parkinson's, and other mental illnesses are increased. These increased age-related illnesses, put tremendous pressure & burden on caregivers, family members, and friends who are living with patients with age-related diseases. As medical needs evolve, the caregiver is expected to experience an increase in duties and challenges, which may result in stress on themselves, and impact their own family life. In the current article, we assess the biological mechanisms of ageing and its effect on body systems, exploring lifestyle and ageing, with a specific focus on age-related disorders. We also discussed the history of caregiving and specific challenges faced by caregivers in the presence of multiple comorbidities. We also assessed innovative approaches to funding caregiving, and efforts to improve the medical system to better organize chronic care efforts, while improving the skill and efficiency of both informal and formal caregivers. We also discussed the role of caregiving in end-of-life care.

Implementing a telehealth-delivered psychoeducational support group for care partners of individuals with primary progressive aphasia.,"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a language-prominent dementia that fundamentally impacts the lives of not only the person with the diagnosis, but also their family members. While assuming a caregiving role, care partners are vulnerable to negative health and psychosocial consequences of their own. Support groups are one way to meet the needs of care partners, providing opportunities for individuals with common experiences to socialize, obtain knowledge about disorders, and learn coping strategies. Given that PPA is rare and that in-person support groups are sparse in the United States, there is a need for alternative meeting modalities, to overcome the limitations imposed by relative scarcity of potential participants, lack of appropriately-trained clinical professionals, and the logistical demands faced by overburdened care providers. Telehealth-based support groups provide care partners with opportunities to connect virtually with other care partners; however, research regarding their feasibility and benefit is limited.",2023,care partner; primary progressive aphasia; psychoeducation; support group; telehealth,,"Schaffer, KM; Henry, ML"
Rlip Reduction Induces Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Mutant Tau-Expressed Immortalized Hippocampal Neurons: Mechanistic Insights.,"RalBP1 (Rlip) is a stress-activated protein that is believed to play a large role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. The purpose of our study was to understand the role of Rlip in mutant Tau-expressed immortalized hippocampal HT22 cells. In the current study, we used mutant Tau (mTau)-expressed HT22 neurons and HT22 cells transfected with Rlip-cDNA and/or silenced RNA, and studied the cell survival, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial function, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analysis of synaptic and mitophagy proteins and the colocalization of Rlip and mTau proteins. We found Rlip protein levels were reduced in mTau-HT22 cells, Rlip silenced HT22 cells, and mTau + Rlip RNA silenced HT22 cells; on the other hand, increased Rlip levels were observed in Rlip cDNA transfected HT22 cells. We found cell survival was decreased in mTau-HT22 cells and RNA-silenced HT22 cells. However, cell survival was increased in Rlip-overexpressed mTau-HT22 cells. A significantly reduced oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was found in mTau-HT22 cells and in RNA-silenced Rlip-HT22 cells, with an even greater reduction in mTau-HT22 + Rlip RNA-silenced HT22 cells. A significantly increased OCR was found in Rlip-overexpressed HT22 cells and in all groups of cells that overexpress Rlip cDNA. Mitochondrial function was defective in mTau-HT22 cells, RNA silenced Rlip in HT22 cells, and was further defective in mTau-HT22 + Rlip RNA-silenced HT22 cells; however, it was rescued in Rlip overexpressed in all groups of HT22 cells. Synaptic and mitophagy proteins were decreased in mTau-HT22 cells, and further reductions were found in RNA-silenced mTau-HT22 cells. However, these were increased in mTau + Rlip-overexpressed HT22 cells. An increased number of mitochondria and decreased mitochondrial length were found in mTau-HT22 cells. These were rescued in Rlip-overexpressed mTau-HT22 cells. These observations strongly suggest that Rlip deficiency causes oxidative stress/mitochondrial dysfunction and Rlip overexpression reverses these defects. Overall, our findings revealed that Rlip is a promising new target for aging, AD, and other tauopathies/neurological diseases.",2023,Rlip deficiency; mitochondrial function; mitophagy; mutant Tau; oxygen consumption rate; phosphorylated tau,"Humans; DNA, Complementary; Alzheimer Disease; Neurons; Tauopathies; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; RNA; Hippocampus","Reddy, PH; Kshirsagar, S; Bose, C; Pradeepkiran, JA; Hindle, A; Singh, SP; Reddy, AP; Baig, J"
Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Speech and language changes occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few studies have characterized their longitudinal course. We analyzed open-ended speech samples from a prodromal-to-mild AD cohort to develop a novel composite score to characterize progressive speech changes. Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD.

Reading and lexical-semantic retrieval tasks outperforms single task speech analysis in the screening of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,"Age-related cognitive impairment have increased dramatically in recent years, which has risen the interes in developing screening tools for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Speech analysis allows to exploit the behavioral consequences of cognitive deficits on the patient's vocal performance so that it is possible to identify pathologies affecting speech production such as dementia. Previous studies have further shown that the speech task used determines how the speech parameters are altered. We aim to combine the impairments in several speech production tasks in order to improve the accuracy of screening through speech analysis. The sample consists of 72 participants divided into three equal groups of healthy older adults, people with mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease, matched by age and education. A complete neuropsychological assessment and two voice recordings were performed. The tasks required the participants to read a text, and complete a sentence with semantic information. A stepwise linear discriminant analysis was performed to select speech parameters with discriminative power. The discriminative functions obtained an accuracy of 83.3% in simultaneous classifications of several levels of cognitive impairment. It would therefore be a promising screening tool for dementia.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Speech; Alzheimer Disease; Semantics; Reading; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests,"Martínez-Nicolás, I; Martínez-Sánchez, F; Ivanova, O; Meilán, JJG"

Rlip overexpression reduces oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: Mechanistic insights.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects a large proportion of the aging population. RalBP1 (Rlip) is a stress-activated protein that plays a crucial role in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases but its precise role in the progression of AD is unclear. The purpose of our study is to understand the role of Rlip in the progression and pathogenesis of AD in mutant APP/amyloid beta (Aβ)-expressed mouse primary hippocampal (HT22) hippocampal neurons. In the current study, we used HT22 neurons that express mAPP, transfected with Rlip-cDNA and/or RNA silenced, and studied cell survival, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial function, immunoblotting & immunofluorescence analysis of synaptic and mitophagy protein's and colocalization of Rlip and mutant APP/Aβ proteins and mitochondrial length and number. We also assessed Rlip levels in autopsy brains from AD patients and control subjects. We found cell survival was decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA-silenced HT22 cells. However, cell survival was increased in Rlip-overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA-silenced Rlip-HT22 cells. OCR was increased in Rlip-overexpressed in mAPP-HT22 cells. Mitochondrial function was defective in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA silenced Rlip in HT22 cells, however, it was rescued in Rlip overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Synaptic and mitophagy proteins were decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells, further reducing RNA-silenced Rlip-HT22 cells. However, these were increased in mAPP+Rlip-HT22 cells. Colocalization analysis revealed Rlip is colocalized with mAPP/Aβ. An increased number of mitochondria and decreased mitochondrial length were found in mAPP-HT22 cells. These were rescued in Rlip overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Reduced Rlip levels were found in autopsy brains from AD patients.

Comprehension of acoustically degraded speech in Alzheimer's disease and primary progressive aphasia.,"Successful communication in daily life depends on accurate decoding of speech signals that are acoustically degraded by challenging listening conditions. This process presents the brain with a demanding computational task that is vulnerable to neurodegenerative pathologies. However, despite recent intense interest in the link between hearing impairment and dementia, comprehension of acoustically degraded speech in these diseases has been little studied. Here we addressed this issue in a cohort of 19 patients with typical Alzheimer's disease and 30 patients representing the three canonical syndromes of primary progressive aphasia (non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia; semantic variant primary progressive aphasia; logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia), compared to 25 healthy age-matched controls. As a paradigm for the acoustically degraded speech signals of daily life, we used noise-vocoding: synthetic division of the speech signal into frequency channels constituted from amplitude-modulated white noise, such that fewer channels convey less spectrotemporal detail thereby reducing intelligibility. We investigated the impact of noise-vocoding on recognition of spoken three-digit numbers and used psychometric modelling to ascertain the threshold number of noise-vocoding channels required for 50% intelligibility by each participant. Associations of noise-vocoded speech intelligibility threshold with general demographic, clinical and neuropsychological characteristics and regional grey matter volume (defined by voxel-based morphometry of patients' brain images) were also assessed. Mean noise-vocoded speech intelligibility threshold was significantly higher in all patient groups than healthy controls, and significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease and logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia than semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (all P < 0.05). In a receiver operating characteristic analysis, vocoded intelligibility threshold discriminated Alzheimer's disease, non-fluent variant and logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia patients very well from healthy controls. Further, this central hearing measure correlated with overall disease severity but not with peripheral hearing or clear speech perception. Neuroanatomically, after correcting for multiple voxel-wise comparisons in predefined regions of interest, impaired noise-vocoded speech comprehension across syndromes was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with atrophy of left planum temporale, angular gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus: a cortical network that has previously been widely implicated in processing degraded speech signals.

Speech changes in old age: Methodological considerations for speech-based discrimination of healthy ageing and Alzheimer's disease.,"Recent evidence suggests that speech substantially changes in ageing. As a complex neurophysiological process, it can accurately reflect changes in the motor and cognitive systems underpinning human speech. Since healthy ageing is not always easily discriminable from early stages of dementia based on cognitive and behavioural hallmarks, speech is explored as a preclinical biomarker of pathological itineraries in old age. A greater and more specific impairment of neuromuscular activation, as well as  a specific cognitive and linguistic impairment in dementia, unchain discriminating changes in speech. Yet, there is no consensus on such discriminatory speech parameters, neither on how they should be elicited and assessed.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; automatic analysis; cognitive impairment; computational linguistics; dementia; healthy ageing; language; non-invasive assessment; speech,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech; Healthy Aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Linguistics,"Ivanova, O; Martínez-Nicolás, I; Meilán, JJG"
Music Therapy in the Treatment of Dementia: A Review Article.,"The etiology of depression is the degeneration of the brain cells involved in cognitive function before the other brain cells. It is characterized by a neurological condition that causes a reduction in terms of physical, social, and cognitive impairment and has no cure presently. These nonpharmacological approaches, such as music therapy, enhance living outcomes for those dealing with dementia and also reduce behavioral incidence. Among these strategies is music therapy, and individual or gap-time psychological and educational counseling. Many scientists believe in the advantages of music for the brain. The brain is affected by music function and enhances some cognitive abilities, including the mechanism of speech, alteration, memory, and learning. Music can activate the limbic system, subcortical circuits, and emotionally related systems, inducing the sensation of well-being. The music itself is quite effective at increasing cerebral plasticity. Music therapy has powerful stimulation for neuroplastic alterations in the adult and developing brain. Dementia can be cured by music therapy and music-based intervention (nonpharmacological intervention) rather than by medication. This study highlights dementia therapy utilizing the music therapy method.",2023,dementia; depressive state; meta-analysis; music therapy; quality of life,,"Shirsat, A; Jha, RK; Verma, P"

Progression of atypical parkinsonian syndromes: PROSPECT-M-UK study implications for clinical trials.,"The advent of clinical trials of disease-modifying agents for neurodegenerative disease highlights the need for evidence-based end point selection. Here we report the longitudinal PROSPECT-M-UK study of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and related disorders, to compare candidate clinical trial end points. In this multicentre UK study, participants were assessed with serial questionnaires, motor examination, neuropsychiatric and MRI assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Participants were classified by diagnosis at baseline and study end, into Richardson syndrome, PSP-subcortical (PSP-parkinsonism and progressive gait freezing subtypes), PSP-cortical (PSP-frontal, PSP-speech and language and PSP-CBS subtypes), MSA-parkinsonism, MSA-cerebellar, CBS with and without evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology and indeterminate syndromes. We calculated annual rate of change, with linear mixed modelling and sample sizes for clinical trials of disease-modifying agents, according to group and assessment type. Two hundred forty-three people were recruited [117 PSP, 68 CBS, 42 MSA and 16 indeterminate; 138 (56.8%) male; age at recruitment 68.7 ± 8.61 years]. One hundred and fifty-nine completed the 6-month assessment (82 PSP, 27 CBS, 40 MSA and 10 indeterminate) and 153 completed the 12-month assessment (80 PSP, 29 CBS, 35 MSA and nine indeterminate). Questionnaire, motor examination, neuropsychiatric and neuroimaging measures declined in all groups, with differences in longitudinal change between groups. Neuroimaging metrics would enable lower sample sizes to achieve equivalent power for clinical trials than cognitive and functional measures, often achieving N < 100 required for 1-year two-arm trials (with 80% power to detect 50% slowing). However, optimal outcome measures were disease-specific. In conclusion, phenotypic variance within PSP, CBS and MSA is a major challenge to clinical trial design. Our findings provide an evidence base for selection of clinical trial end points, from potential functional, cognitive, clinical or neuroimaging measures of disease progression.",2023,clinical trials; corticobasal syndrome; multiple system atrophy; progressive supranuclear palsy; sample size,"Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Female; Parkinsonian Disorders; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; Multiple System Atrophy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; United Kingdom","Street, D; Jabbari, E; Costantini, A; Jones, PS; Holland, N; Rittman, T; Jensen, MT; Chelban, V; Goh, YY; Guo, T; Heslegrave, AJ; Roncaroli, F; Klein, JC; Ansorge, O; Allinson, KSJ; Jaunmuktane, Z; Revesz, T; Warner, TT; Lees, AJ; Zetterberg, H; Russell, LL; Bocchetta, M; Rohrer, JD; Burn, DJ; Pavese, N; Gerhard, A; Kobylecki, C; Leigh, PN; Church, A; Hu, MTM; Houlden, H; Morris, H; Rowe, JB"
Natural language processing techniques for studying language in pathological ageing: A scoping review.,"In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the employment of verbal productions as digital biomarkers, namely objective, quantifiable behavioural data that can be collected and measured by means of digital devices, allowing for a low-cost pathology detection, classification and monitoring. Numerous research papers have been published on the automatic detection of subtle verbal alteration, starting from written texts, raw speech recordings and transcripts, and such linguistic analysis has been singled out as a cost-effective method for diagnosing dementia and other medical conditions common among elderly patients (e.g., cognitive dysfunctions associated with metabolic disorders, dysarthria).",2024,dementia; digital linguistic biomarkers; natural language processing; pathological ageing,Aged; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Dysarthria; Dementia; Aging; Biomarkers,"Gagliardi, G"

The effects of white matter hyperintensities on MEG power spectra in population with mild cognitive impairment.,"Cerebrovascular disease is responsible for up to 20% of cases of dementia worldwide, but also it is a major comorbid contributor to the progression of other neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are the most prevalent imaging marker in cerebrovascular disease. The presence and progression of WMH in the brain have been associated with general cognitive impairment and the risk to develop all types of dementia. The aim of this piece of work is the assessment of brain functional differences in an MCI population based on the WMH volume. One-hundred and twenty-nine individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent a neuropsychological evaluation, MRI assessment (T1 and Flair), and MEG recordings (5 min of eyes closed resting state).

Differences of Modality Use between Telepractice and Face-to-Face Administration of the Scenario-Test in Persons with Dementia-Related Speech Disorder.,"Telepractice is increasingly finding its way into the care of people with dementia. Web-based delivery of speech and language therapy (SLT) is feasible and has the potential to improve communication in people with dementia-related speech disorders. Although experts are discussing the strengths and weaknesses of telepractice, a precise analysis of the differences between analogue and digital communication for this heterogeneous group of patients is still missing. The three current single cases investigated verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication in a face-to-face (F2F) and digital setting through a qualitative research design. Using the scenario-test (ST) in person and via big blue button (BBB; video conferencing system), several decisive factors were detected, influencing the effectiveness of communication in a F2F compared to a digital setting. The most important results of the qualitative content analysis are described for each case individually. Additionally, the influence of person-related factors, such as age, diagnosis, presence of depression, and level of education, is presented. Perceptual, executive, and affective disorders, as well as aids of relatives, are considered separately. The results indicate that executive functions, affects, and perceptual deficits need to be taken into account if telepractice is to be applied. Age, education, and distinct forms of dementia might be decisive for successful telepractice as well.",2023,modality use; primary progressive aphasia; telepractice,,"Gauch, M; Corsten, S; Geschke, K; Heinrich, I; Leinweber, J; Spelter, B"

Plasticity After Hearing Rehabilitation in the Aging Brain.,"Age-related hearing loss, presbycusis, is an unavoidable sensory degradation, often associated with the progressive decline of cognitive and social functions, and dementia. It is generally considered a natural consequence of the inner-ear deterioration. However, presbycusis arguably conflates a wide array of peripheral and central impairments. Although hearing rehabilitation maintains the integrity and activity of auditory networks and can prevent or revert maladaptive plasticity, the extent of such neural plastic changes in the aging brain is poorly appreciated. By reanalyzing a large-scale dataset of more than 2200 cochlear implant users (CI) and assessing the improvement in speech perception from 6 to 24 months of use, we show that, although rehabilitation improves speech understanding on average, age at implantation only minimally affects speech scores at 6 months but has a pejorative effect at 24 months post implantation. Furthermore, older subjects (>67 years old) were significantly more likely to degrade their performances after 2 years of CI use than the younger patients for each year increase in age. Secondary analysis reveals three possible plasticity trajectories after auditory rehabilitation to account for these disparities: Awakening, reversal of deafness-specific changes; Counteracting, stabilization of additional cognitive impairments; or Decline, independent pejorative processes that hearing rehabilitation cannot prevent. The role of complementary behavioral interventions needs to be considered to potentiate the (re)activation of auditory brain networks.",2023,aging; auditory loss; cochlear implant; cognitive decline; presbycusis,Humans; Infant; Aged; Presbycusis; Deafness; Hearing; Cochlear Implants; Cochlear Implantation; Aging; Speech Perception; Brain,"Lazard, DS; Doelling, KB; Arnal, LH"

Predictive language comprehension in Parkinson's disease.,"Verb and action knowledge deficits are reported in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), even in the absence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. However, the impact of these deficits on combinatorial semantic processing is less well understood. Following on previous verb and action knowledge findings, we tested the hypothesis that PD impairs the ability to integrate event-based thematic fit information during online sentence processing. Specifically, we anticipated persons with PD with age-typical cognitive abilities would perform more poorly than healthy controls during a visual world paradigm task requiring participants to predict a target object constrained by the thematic fit of the agent-verb combination. Twenty-four PD and 24 healthy age-matched participants completed comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. We recorded participants' eye movements as they heard predictive sentences (The fisherman rocks the boat) alongside target, agent-related, verb-related, and unrelated images. We tested effects of group (PD/control) on gaze using growth curve models. There were no significant differences between PD and control participants, suggesting that PD participants successfully and rapidly use combinatory thematic fit information to predict upcoming language. Baseline sentences with no predictive information (e.g., Look at the drum) confirmed that groups showed equivalent sentence processing and eye movement patterns. Additionally, we conducted an exploratory analysis contrasting PD and controls' performance on low-motion-content versus high-motion-content verbs. This analysis revealed fewer predictive fixations in high-motion sentences only for healthy older adults. PD participants may adapt to their disease by relying on spared, non-action-simulation-based language processing mechanisms, although this conclusion is speculative, as the analyses of high- vs. low-motion items was highly limited by the study design. These findings provide novel evidence that individuals with PD match healthy adults in their ability to use verb meaning to predict upcoming nouns despite previous findings of verb semantic impairment in PD across a variety of tasks.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Parkinson Disease; Comprehension; Language; Semantics; Neuropsychological Tests,"Aveni, K; Ahmed, J; Borovsky, A; McRae, K; Jenkins, ME; Sprengel, K; Fraser, JA; Orange, JB; Knowles, T; Roberts, AC"

"Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of Word Production Abilities in Dysfunction of the Basal Ganglia: Stroke, Small Vessel Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease.","Clinical populations with basal ganglia pathologies may present with language production impairments, which are often described in combination with comprehension measures or attributed to motor, memory, or processing-speed problems. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we studied word production in four (vascular and non-vascular) pathologies of the basal ganglia: stroke affecting the basal ganglia, small vessel disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. We compared scores of these clinical populations with those of matched cognitively unimpaired adults on four well-established production tasks, namely picture naming, category fluency, letter fluency, and past-tense verb inflection. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and PsycINFO with terms for basal ganglia structures, basal ganglia disorders and language production tasks. A total of 114 studies were included, containing results for one or more of the tasks of interest. For each pathology and task combination, effect sizes (Hedges' g) were extracted comparing patient versus control groups. For all four populations, performance was consistently worse than that of cognitively unimpaired adults across the four language production tasks (p-values < 0.010). Given that performance in picture naming and verb inflection across all pathologies was quantified in terms of accuracy, our results suggest that production impairments cannot be fully explained by motor or processing-speed deficits.

Cerebral blood flow predicts multiple demand network activity and fluid intelligence across the adult lifespan.,"The preservation of cognitive function in old age is a public health priority. Cerebral hypoperfusion is a hallmark of dementia but its impact on maintaining cognitive ability across the lifespan is less clear. We investigated the relationship between baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response during a fluid reasoning task in a population-based adult lifespan cohort. As age differences in CBF could lead to non-neuronal contributions to the BOLD signal, we introduced commonality analysis to neuroimaging to dissociate performance-related CBF effects from the physiological confounding effects of CBF on the BOLD response. Accounting for CBF, we confirmed that performance- and age-related differences in BOLD responses in the multiple-demand network were implicated in fluid reasoning. Age differences in CBF explained not only performance-related BOLD responses but also performance-independent BOLD responses. Our results suggest that CBF is important for maintaining cognitive function, while its non-neuronal contributions to BOLD signals reflect an age-related confound. Maintaining perfusion into old age may serve to support brain function and preserve cognitive performance.",2023,Ageing; Cerebral blood flow; Commonality analysis; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Multiple demand network,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Longevity; Brain; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Intelligence; Oxygen; Brain Mapping,"Wu, S; Tyler, LK; Henson, RNA; Rowe, JB; Tsvetanov, KA"

"Warning Signs of Acute Infectious Disease-Related Illness in Persons Living With Dementia: Perspectives of Primary Care Providers, Adult Day Service Center Staff, and Family Care Partners.","In the current study, we conducted one-on-one interviews with primary care providers (PCPs) and family care partners (FCPs) and held focus groups with interdisciplinary adult day service center (ADSC) staff to understand the perspectives of care providers across community settings regarding early warning signs of acute illnesses in persons living with dementia (PLWD). We used content analysis to analyze qualitative data. Warning signs of acute illnesses in PLWD fell into one of five categories, including new onset changes in (a) physical functions, (b) moods or behaviors (psychological), (c) social interactions, (d) speech, or (e) appearance.

Pyrimidines: Molecular docking and inhibition studies on carbonic anhydrase and cholinesterases.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. The disease is characterized by dementia, memory impairment, cognitive impairment, and speech impairment. Cholinesterases (ChEs; AChE, acetylcholinesterase and BChE, butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitors and their benefits of cholinergic replacement in the treatment of AD have been researched and documented by scientists in various ways to date. Recent studies prove that human carbonic anhydrases (hCAs) are also one of the important targets in the treatment of AD. Therefore, the development of new agents that can simultaneously modulate the various mechanisms or targets involved in the AD pathway may be a powerful strategy to treat AD, the current disease. Considering these data, the effects of the pyrimidines (1-7) were investigated in this study for the discovery and development of multitargeted ChEs and hCAs inhibitors associated with AD. In addition, the molecular docking analysis of the 4-amino-2-choloropyrimidine (2) was performed to understand the binding interactions on the active site of the enzyme. All compounds (1-7) showed satisfactory enzyme inhibitory potency in micromolar concentrations against AChE, BChE, hCAI, and hCAII with K",2023,biological activity; enzymes; inhibition; molecular docking; pyrimidine,Humans; Butyrylcholinesterase; Acetylcholinesterase; Molecular Docking Simulation; Carbonic Anhydrases; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Pyrimidines; Molecular Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship,"Duran, HE"
