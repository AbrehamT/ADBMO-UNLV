Genetic evidence for serum amyloid P component as a drug target in neurodegenerative disorders.,"The mechanisms responsible for neuronal death causing cognitive loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other dementias are not known. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a constitutive plasma protein, which is cytotoxic for cerebral neurones and also promotes formation and persistence of cerebral A",2024,Alzheimer's disease; C-reactive protein‌; Lewy body dementia; genome-wide association study; miridesap; serum amyloid P component,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Serum Amyloid P-Component; Alzheimer Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Lewy Body Disease; Male; Female","Schmidt, AF; Finan, C; Chopade, S; Ellmerich, S; Rossor, MN; Hingorani, AD; Pepys, MB"
APOE 5'UTR Methylation Pattern Analysis in Blood and Brain Tissue from Alzheimer's Disease Affected Patients.,"APOE ε4 allele is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Furthermore, APOE methylation pattern has been described to be associated with the disease and to follow a bimodal pattern, with a hypermethylated CpG island and a hypomethylated promoter region. However, little is known about the methylation levels in the APOE 5'UTR region. Here, the methylation of two regions (R1 and R2) within APOE 5'UTR was investigated in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and hippocampus (HIC) samples to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and to associate clinical, genetic features and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers levels. DNA was extracted from PBMCs of 20 AD and 20 healthy controls (HC) and from 6 AD and 3 HC HIC samples. The methylation analysis was carried out by means of pyrosequencing. In AD PBMCs we found that R1 region displayed a higher methylation level, while the opposite trend was observed in R2. The presence of ε4 allele highlighted a marked increase in R1 methylation level and a decrease in R2. In AD PBMCs and HIC, age progression resulted to be associated with an increase in the methylation level of R1. Lastly, the methylation of a CpG site in R2 was found to be related to CSF biomarkers. Despite the lack of a statistical significance, the outcome from this exploratory analysis highlighted the presence of a difference in methylation in APOE 5'UTR in PBMCs of AD patients which seemed to be associated also with APOE genotype, age and CSF biomarkers level.",2024,,,"Gerlando, RD; Dragoni, F; Rizzo, B; Ferrari, RR; Zardini, E; Ramusino, MC; Perini, G; Costa, A; Poloni, TE; Pansarasa, O; Davin, A; Gagliardi, S"
Mitochondrial DNA abundance in blood is associated with Alzheimer's disease- and dementia-risk.,"The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been portrayed through molecular, cellular, and animal studies; however large epidemiological studies are lacking. This study aimed to explore the association of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), a marker representative of mtDNA abundance per cell, with risk of incident all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia diagnosis within 17 years and dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL). Additionally, sex-stratified analyses were completed. In this German population-based cohort study (ESTHER), 9940 participants aged 50-75 years were enrolled by general practitioners and followed for 17 years. Participants were included in this study if information on dementia status and blood-based mtDNAcn measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction were available. In a nested case-control approach, a subsample of participants additionally had measurements of P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL in blood samples taken at baseline. Of 4913 participants eligible for analyses, 386 were diagnosed with incident all-cause dementia, including 130 AD and 143 vascular dementia cases, while 4527 participants remained without dementia diagnosis within 17 years. Participants with low mtDNAcn (lowest 10%) experienced 45% and 65% percent increased risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD after adjusting for age and sex (all-cause dementia: HRadj, 95%CI:1.45, 1.08-1.94; AD: HRadj, 95%CI: 1.65, 1.01-2.68). MtDNAcn was not associated to vascular dementia diagnosis and was more strongly associated with all-cause dementia among women. In the nested case-control study (n = 790), mtDNAcn was not significantly associated with the dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) levels in blood from baseline before dementia diagnosis. This study provides novel epidemiological evidence connecting mtDNA abundance, measured via mtDNAcn, to incident dementia and AD at the population-based level. Reduced mitochondrial abundance may play a role in pathogenesis, especially among women.",2024,,,"Stocker, H; Gentiluomo, M; Trares, K; Beyer, L; Stevenson-Hoare, J; Rujescu, D; Holleczek, B; Beyreuther, K; Gerwert, K; Schöttker, B; Campa, D; Canzian, F; Brenner, H"
Prospects and challenges in using neuronal extracellular vesicles in biomarker research.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promise as a source of disease biomarkers. The diverse molecular cargo of EVs can potentially indicate the status of their tissue of origin, even against the complex background of whole plasma. The main tools currently available for assessing biomarkers of brain health include brain imaging and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Given the costs and difficulties associated with these methods, isolation of EVs of neuronal origin (NEVs) from the blood is an attractive approach to identify brain-specific biomarkers. This perspective describes current key challenges in EV- and NEV-based biomarker research. These include the relative low abundance of EVs, the lack of validated isolation methods, and the difficult search for an adequate target for immunocapturing NEVs. We discuss that these challenges must be addressed before NEVs can fulfill their potential for biomarker research. HIGHLIGHTS: NEVs are promising sources of biomarkers for brain disorders. Immunocapturing NEVs from complex biofluids presents several challenges. The choice of surface target for capture will determine NEV yield. Contamination by non-EV sources is relevant for biomarkers at low concentrations.",2024,biomarkers; central nervous system; neurodegenerative disorders; neuronal‐enriched extracellular vesicles,,"Rocha, DAS; Santos, LE; Da Fonseca, PB; De Felice, FG"
Diffusion model enables quantitative CBF analysis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a promising biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). ASL data from multiple vendors were included in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. However, the M0 images were missing in Siemens ASL data, prohibiting CBF quantification. Here, we utilized a generative diffusion model to impute the missing M0 and validated generated CBF data with acquired data from GE.",2024,,,"Shou, Q; Cen, S; Chen, NK; Ringman, JM; Wen, J; Kim, H; Wang, DJ"
Circulating levels of neurofilament light chain as a biomarker of infarct and white matter hyperintensity volumes after ischemic stroke.,"Serum neurofilament light chain protein (sNfL) shows promise as a biomarker for infarct size in acute ischemic stroke and for monitoring cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). However, distinguishing the cSVD contribution after stroke may not be possible due to post-stroke sNfL increase. Additionally, it remains unclear if etiologic subtype differences exist. We measured infarct and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes using MRI at the index stroke in ischemic stroke patients (n = 316, mean age 53 years, 65% males) and at 7-year follow-up (n = 187). Serum NfL concentration was measured in the acute phase (n = 235), at 3-months (n = 288), and 7-years (n = 190) post stroke. In multivariable regression, acute and 3-month sNfL concentrations were associated with infarct volume and time since stroke, but not with stroke etiology or infarct location. Seven years post-stroke, sNfL was associated with WMHs and age, but not with stroke etiology. Nonlinear regression estimated that sNfL peaks around 1 month, and declines by 50% at 3 months, and 99% at 9 months. We conclude that sNfL can indicate infarct volume and time since brain injury in the acute and subacute phases after stroke. Due to the significant post-stroke sNfL increase, several months are needed for reliable assessment of cSVD activity.",2024,,Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Neurofilament Proteins; Biomarkers; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Ischemic Stroke; Aged; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Adult,"Holmegaard, L; Jensen, C; Pedersen, A; Blomstrand, C; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Jood, K; Jern, C"
Navigating the Intersection: Diabetes and Alzheimer's Intertwined Relationship.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Diabetes mellitus (DM) exhibit comparable pathophysiological pathways. Genetic abnormalities in APP, PS-1, and PS-2 are linked to AD, with diagnostic aid from CSF and blood biomarkers. Insulin dysfunction, termed ""type 3 diabetes mellitus"" in AD, involves altered insulin signalling and neuronal shrinkage. Insulin influences beta-amyloid metabolism, exacerbating neurotoxicity in AD and amyloid production in DM. Both disorders display impaired glucose transporter expression, hastening cognitive decline. Mitochondrial dysfunction and Toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammation worsen neurodegeneration in both diseases. ApoE4 raises disease risk, especially when coupled with dyslipidemia common in DM. Targeting shared pathways like insulin-degrading enzyme activation and HSP60 holds promise for therapeutic intervention. Recognizing these interconnected mechanisms underscores the imperative for developing tailored treatments addressing the overlapping pathophysiology of AD and DM, offering potential avenues for more effective management of both conditions.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Diabetes mellitus; beta amyloid; insulin resistance; neurodegeneration,,"Kale, MB; Bhondge, HM; Wankhede, NL; Shende, PV; Thanekaer, RP; Aglawe, MM; Rahangdale, SR; Taksande, BG; Pandit, SB; Upaganlawar, AB; Umekar, MJ; Kopalli, SR; Koppula, S"

Associations of Circulating Biomarkers with Disease Risks: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Circulating biomarkers play a pivotal role in personalized medicine, offering potential for disease screening, prevention, and treatment. Despite established associations between numerous biomarkers and diseases, elucidating their causal relationships is challenging. Mendelian Randomization (MR) can address this issue by employing genetic instruments to discern causal links. Additionally, using multiple MR methods with overlapping results enhances the reliability of discovered relationships. Here, we report an MR study using multiple methods, including inverse variance weighted, simple mode, weighted mode, weighted median, and MR-Egger. We use the MR-base resource (v0.5.6) from Hemani et al. 2018 to evaluate causal relationships between 212 circulating biomarkers (curated from UK Biobank analyses by Neale lab and from Shin et al. 2014, Roederer et al. 2015, and Kettunen et al. 2016 and 99 complex diseases (curated from several consortia by MRC IEU and Biobank Japan). We report novel causal relationships found by four or more MR methods between glucose and bipolar disorder (Mean Effect Size estimate across methods: 0.39) and between cystatin C and bipolar disorder (Mean Effect Size: -0.31). Based on agreement in four or more methods, we also identify previously known links between urate with gout and creatine with chronic kidney disease, as well as biomarkers that may be causal of cardiovascular conditions: apolipoprotein B, cholesterol, LDL, lipoprotein A, and triglycerides in coronary heart disease, as well as lipoprotein A, LDL, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B in myocardial infarction. This Mendelian Randomization study not only corroborates known causal relationships between circulating biomarkers and diseases but also uncovers two novel biomarkers associated with bipolar disorder that warrant further investigation. Our findings provide insight into understanding how biological processes reflecting circulating biomarkers and their associated effects may contribute to disease etiology, which can eventually help improve precision diagnostics and intervention.",2024,biomarkers; human disease; mendelian randomization; metabolome; proteome,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Biomarkers; Bipolar Disorder; Cardiovascular Diseases; Risk Factors; Cystatin C; Gout,"Elmas, A; Spehar, K; Do, R; Castellano, JM; Huang, KL"

This study aimed to investigate these associations, focusing on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, cognitive measures, and brain imaging data. Eight hundred and fifty-five non-demented participants were included. Linear regression was used to explore associations between the TyG-BMI index and AD pathology, cognition, and brain structure. The association between the TyG-BMI index and AD risk was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Longitudinal relationships were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. Mediation analyses were conducted to examine AD pathology's potential mediating role between the TyG-BMI index and cognition as well as brain structure.

Genetic and multi-omic resources for Alzheimer disease and related dementia from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center.,"The Knight-Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC) at Washington University in St. Louis has pioneered and led worldwide seminal studies that have expanded our clinical, social, pathological, and molecular understanding of Alzheimer Disease. Over more than 40 years, research volunteers have been recruited to participate in cognitive, neuropsychologic, imaging, fluid biomarkers, genomic and multi-omic studies. Tissue and longitudinal data collected to foster, facilitate, and support research on dementia and aging. The Genetics and high throughput -omics core (GHTO) have collected of more than 26,000 biological samples from 6,625 Knight-ADRC participants. Samples available include longitudinal DNA, RNA, non-fasted plasma, cerebrospinal fluid pellets, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The GHTO has performed deep molecular profiling (genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) from large number of brain (n = 2,117), CSF (n = 2,012) and blood/plasma (n = 8,265) samples with the goal of identifying novel risk and protective variants, identify novel molecular biomarkers and causal and druggable targets.

Antigen-specific age-related memory CD8 T cells induce and track Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration.,"Cerebral (Aβ) plaque and (pTau) tangle deposition are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet are insufficient to confer complete AD-like neurodegeneration experimentally. Factors acting upstream of Aβ/pTau in AD remain unknown, but their identification could enable earlier diagnosis and more effective treatments. T cell abnormalities are emerging AD hallmarks, and CD8 T cells were recently found to mediate neurodegeneration downstream of tangle deposition in hereditary neurodegeneration models. The precise impact of T cells downstream of Aβ/pTau, however, appears to vary depending on the animal model.

Predicting Longitudinal Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Conversion in Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients Based on Plasma Biomarkers.,"The increasing burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) emphasizes the need for effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Despite available treatments targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, disease-modifying therapies remain elusive. Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients at risk for AD conversion is crucial, especially with anti-Aβ therapy. While plasma biomarkers hold promise in differentiating AD from MCI, evidence on predicting cognitive decline is lacking. This study's objectives were to evaluate whether plasma protein biomarkers could predict both cognitive decline in non-demented individuals and the conversion to AD in patients with MCI. This study was conducted as part of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia (KLOSCAD), a prospective, community-based cohort. Participants were based on plasma biomarker availability and clinical diagnosis at baseline. The study included MCI (n = 50), MCI-to-AD (n = 21), and cognitively unimpaired (CU, n = 40) participants. Baseline plasma concentrations of six proteins-total tau (tTau), phosphorylated tau at residue 181 (pTau181), amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), amyloid beta 40 (Aβ40), neurofilament light chain (NFL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-along with three derivative ratios (pTau181/tTau, Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181/Aβ42) were analyzed to predict cognitive decline over a six-year follow-up period. Baseline protein biomarkers were stratified into tertiles (low, intermediate, and high) and analyzed using a linear mixed model (LMM) to predict longitudinal cognitive changes. In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to discern whether protein biomarkers could predict AD conversion in the MCI subgroup. This prospective cohort study revealed that plasma NFL may predict longitudinal declines in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. In participants categorized as amyloid positive, the NFL biomarker demonstrated predictive performance for both MMSE and total scores of the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Packet (CERAD-TS) longitudinally. Additionally, as a baseline predictor, GFAP exhibited a significant association with cross-sectional cognitive impairment in the CERAD-TS measure, particularly in amyloid positive participants. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis indicated predictive performance of NFL, GFAP, tTau, and Aβ42/Aβ40 on MCI-to-AD conversion. This study suggests that plasma GFAP in non-demented participants may reflect baseline cross-sectional CERAD-TS scores, a measure of global cognitive function. Conversely, plasma NFL may predict longitudinal decline in MMSE and CERAD-TS scores in participants categorized as amyloid positive. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis suggests that NFL, GFAP, tTau, and Aβ42/Aβ40 are potentially robust predictors of future AD conversion.",2024,MCI-to-AD conversion; cognitive decline; linear mixed model; neuropsychological measure; plasma biomarker,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Female; Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Disease Progression; Neurofilament Proteins; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Prospective Studies,"Park, MK; Ahn, J; Kim, YJ; Lee, JW; Lee, JC; Hwang, SJ; Kim, KC"
"Interplay between glypican-1, amyloid-β and tau phosphorylation in human neural stem cells.",Alzheimeŕs disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (Tau-P) in the brain. Aβ enhances the activity of kinases involved in the formation of Tau-P. Phosphorylation at Thr 181 determines the propagation of multiple tau phosphorylations. Aβ is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cleavage of APP by β-secretase also initiates release of heparan sulfate (HS) from the proteoglycan glypican-1 (GPC1).,2024,,,"Cheng, F; Fransson, LÅ; Mani, K"
Evaluation of core Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in saliva and plasma measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays on a fully automated platform.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid peptide beta-42 (Aβ42), Aβ42/40 ratio, and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are precious tools for supporting AD diagnosis. However, their use in clinical practice is limited due to the invasiveness of CSF collection. Thus, there is intensive research to find alternative, noninvasive, and widely accessible biological matrices to measure AD core biomarkers. In this study, we measured AD core biomarkers in saliva and plasma by a fully automated platform. We enrolled all consecutive patients with cognitive decline. For each patient, we measured Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau levels in CSF, saliva, and plasma by Lumipulse G1200 (Fujirebio). We included forty-two patients, of whom 27 had AD. Levels of all biomarkers significantly differed in the three biofluids, with saliva having the lowest and CSF the highest levels of Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau. A positive correlation of pTau, Aβ42/40 ratio, and pTau/Aβ42 ratio levels in CSF and plasma was detected, while no correlation between any biomarker in CSF and saliva was found. Our findings suggest that plasma but not saliva could represent a surrogate biofluid for measuring core AD biomarkers. Specifically, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, pTau/Aβ42 ratio, and pTau could serve as surrogates of the corresponding CSF biomarkers.",2024,AD; Beta-amyloid; Biomarker; Fujirebio; Plasma; Saliva; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Saliva; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments; Luminescent Measurements; Aged, 80 and over","Agnello, L; Giglio, RV; Del Ben, F; Piccoli, T; Colletti, T; Scazzone, C; Lo Sasso, B; Ciaccio, AM; Gambino, CM; Salemi, G; Ciaccio, M"
Clinical and diagnostic implications of Alzheimer's disease copathology in Lewy body disease.,"Concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is a frequent event in the context of Lewy body disease (LBD), occurring in approximately half of all cases. Evidence shows that LBD patients with AD copathology show an accelerated disease course, a greater risk of cognitive decline and an overall poorer prognosis. However, LBD-AD cases may show heterogeneous motor and non-motor phenotypes with higher risk of dementia, and, consequently, be not rarely misdiagnosed. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art on LBD-AD by discussing the synergistic effects between AD neuropathological changes and Lewy pathology and their clinical relevance. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers under assessment in LBD-AD and their possible diagnostic and prognostic value. AD pathology can be suspected in vivo by means of CSF, MRI and PET markers, whereas α-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAAs) represent to date the most promising technique to identify Lewy pathology in different biological tissues. Pathological imaging and CSF AD biomarkers are associated with a higher likelihood of cognitive decline in LBD but do not always mirror the neuropathological severity like in pure AD. The implementation of blood-based biomarkers of AD might allow the fast screening of LBD patients for AD copathology, thus improving the overall diagnostic sensitivity for LBD-AD. Finally, we discuss the literature on novel candidate biomarkers being exploited in LBD-AD to investigate other aspects of neurodegeneration, such as neuroaxonal injury, glial activation and synaptic dysfunction. The thorough characterization of AD copathology in LBD should be taken into account for the differential diagnosis of dementia syndromes, for the prognostic evaluation on an individual level and for guiding symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies.",2024,PET; Parkinson’s disease; biomarkers; dementia with Lewy body; neurofilament; α-synuclein SAAs,,"Barba, L; Abu-Rumeileh, S; Barthel, H; Massa, F; Foschi, M; Bellomo, G; Gaetani, L; Thal, DR; Parnetti, L; Otto, M"
Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: Towards accuracy and accessibility.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious dementia afflicting aging population and is characterized by cognitive decline, amyloid-β plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. AD substantially impairs the life quality of the victims and poses a heavy burden on the society at large. The number of people with dementia due to AD, prodromal AD, and preclinical AD is estimated to stand at roughly 3.2, 69, and 315 million worldwide, respectively. Current clinical diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, and clinical research demonstrated that positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers had excellent diagnostic performance. However, the application of CSF biomarker tests and PET are restricted by the invasiveness and high cost. The presence of clinical symptoms means that AD pathology has been progressing for many years, and only a few drugs have been approved for the traetemnt of AD. Therefore, early diagnosis is extremely important for controlling the outcomes caused by AD. In this review, we provided an overview of developing clinical diagnostic criteria, diagnostic strategies under clinical research, developing blood based-biomarker assays, and promising nanotechnologically-based assays.",2024,Alzheimer’s Disease; Biomarker; Detection methods; Diagnostic criteria; the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association,,"Mu, Y; Chang, KX; Chen, YF; Yan, K; Wang, CX; Hua, Q"
Predicting Alzheimer's disease CSF core biomarkers: a multimodal Machine Learning approach.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Current core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, widely employed for diagnosis, require a lumbar puncture to be performed, making them impractical as screening tools. Considering the role of sleep disturbances in AD, recent research suggests quantitative sleep electroencephalography features as potential non-invasive biomarkers of AD pathology. However, quantitative analysis of comprehensive polysomnography (PSG) signals remains relatively understudied. PSG is a non-invasive test enabling qualitative and quantitative analysis of a wide range of parameters, offering additional insights alongside other biomarkers.

Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common neurodegenerative disorders. AD is characterized by deposition of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, leading to associated secondary pathologies, progressive neurodegeneration, and eventually death. Currently used diagnostics are largely image-based, lack accuracy and do not detect early disease, ie, prior to onset of symptoms, thus limiting treatment options and outcomes. Although biomarkers such as amyloid-β and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid have gained much attention, these are generally limited to disease progression. Unfortunately, identification of biomarkers for early and accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. As such, body fluids such as sweat, serum, saliva, mucosa, tears, and urine are under investigation as alternative sources for biomarkers that can aid in early disease detection. This review focuses on biomarkers identified through proteomics in various biofluids and their potential for early and accurate diagnosis of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biofluid; Biomarker; Blood; CSF; Diagnosis; Saliva; Sweat; Tears,,"Rajendran, K; Krishnan, UM"

High levels of neurofilament light and YKL-40 in cerebrospinal fluid are related to poor outcome in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disease without effective treatment. No pathognomonic test can diagnose ALS in sporadic cases. Routine investigation in suspected cases includes neurological examination, imaging of the brain and spine and electromyography supported by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses. The ALS diagnosis is made by clinical judgement and results from examinations. We aimed to study if the CSF biomarkers neurofilament light protein (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), YKL-40, soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) α and β, and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) were associated with ALS diagnosis and could predict disease progression. Eighty-one patients with suspected ALS were included after referral to the neurological clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Fifty-nine patients were diagnosed having ALS, while 22 patients were given alternative diagnoses and labeled ALS mimics. Finally, 25 age-matched neurologically intact individuals were used as controls. ALS patients had significantly higher CSF levels of NFL than controls and mimics. Levels of YKL-40 and GFAP were significantly higher in ALS patients compared with controls. No difference was found between study groups when comparing levels of sAPPα, sAPPβ and sTREM2. Further, elevated levels of NFL and YKL-40 were associated with an increased hazard of death and the annual decline in ALSFRS-R. We also found that patients with elevated levels of both NFL and YKL-40 had a particularly poor prognosis. The results demonstrate the usefulness of CSF biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognostication of ALS.",2024,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Brain damage markers; Diagnosis; GFAP; Neurofilament light protein; Prognosis; YKL-40,,"Rosén, C; Mitre, B; Nellgård, B; Axelsson, M; Constantinescu, R; Andersen, PM; Dalla, K; Blennow, K; Nilsson, G; Zetterberg, H; Rosén, H"

Serum and CSF metabolomics analysis shows Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates risk factors of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a person's dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KD's metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.",2024,Diseases; Metabolomics,,"Schweickart, A; Batra, R; Neth, BJ; Martino, C; Shenhav, L; Zhang, AR; Shi, P; Karu, N; Huynh, K; Meikle, PJ; Schimmel, L; Dilmore, AH; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Blach, C; Dorrestein, PC; Knight, R; Craft, S; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Krumsiek, J"

"Blood brain barrier dysfunction in healthy aging and dementia: Why, how, what for?","The blood brain barrier (BBB) is an indispensable structure that maintains the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment for a correct neuronal function. It is composed by highly specialized microvessels, surrounded by astrocytes, pericytes, neurons and microglia cells, which tightly control the influx and efflux of substances to the brain parenchyma. During aging, the BBB becomes impaired, and it may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative and neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Restoring the BBB can be a strategy to prevent disease onset and development, reducing the symptoms of these conditions.

"Childhood blood-lead level predicts lower general, non-selective hippocampal subfield volumes in midlife.","Millions of adults and children are exposed to high levels of lead, a neurotoxicant, each year. Recent evidence suggests that lead exposure may precipitate neurodegeneration, particularly if the exposure occurs early or late in life, with unique alterations to the structure or function of specific subfields of the hippocampus, a region involved in memory and Alzheimer's disease. It has been proposed that specific hippocampal subfields may thus be useful biomarkers for lead-associated neurological disease. We turned to a population-representative New Zealand birth cohort where the extent of lead exposure was not confounded by social class (the Dunedin Study; born 1972-1973 and followed to age 45) to test the hypothesis that early life lead exposure (blood-lead level at age 11 years) is associated with smaller MRI-assessed gray matter volumes of specific subfields of the hippocampus at age 45 years. Among the 508 Dunedin Study members with childhood lead data and adult MRI data passing quality control (93.9 % of those with lead data who attended the age-45 assessment wave, 240[47.2 %] female), childhood blood-lead levels ranged from 4 to 31 µg/dL (M[SD]=10.9[4.6]).

Potential role of tanycyte-derived neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.,"Tanycytes, specialized ependymal cells located in the hypothalamus, play a crucial role in the generation of new neurons that contribute to the neural circuits responsible for regulating the systemic energy balance. The precise coordination of the gene networks controlling neurogenesis in naive and mature tanycytes is essential for maintaining homeostasis in adulthood. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that govern the proliferation and differentiation of tanycytes into neurons remains limited. This article aims to review the recent advancements in research into the mechanisms and functions of tanycyte-derived neurogenesis. Studies employing lineage-tracing techniques have revealed that the neurogenesis specifically originating from tanycytes in the hypothalamus has a compensatory role in neuronal loss and helps maintain energy homeostasis during metabolic diseases. Intriguingly, metabolic disorders are considered early biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the neurogenic potential of tanycytes and the state of newborn neurons derived from tanycytes heavily depend on the maintenance of mild microenvironments, which may be disrupted in Alzheimer's disease due to the impaired blood-brain barrier function. However, the specific alterations and regulatory mechanisms governing tanycyte-derived neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests that tanycyte-derived neurogenesis might be impaired in Alzheimer's disease, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Confirming this hypothesis, however, poses a challenge because of the lack of long-term tracing and nucleus-specific analyses of newborn neurons in the hypothalamus of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying tanycyte-derived neurogenesis holds promise for identifying small molecules capable of restoring tanycyte proliferation in neurodegenerative diseases. This line of investigation could provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease and related conditions.",2024,,,"Qi, G; Tang, H; Hu, J; Kang, S; Qin, S"
Implementation of Modern Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Lipidomics Approaches in Clinical Practice: A Case Study with Colistin Treatment.,"Nowadays, lipidomics plays a crucial role in the investigation of novel biomarkers of various diseases. Its implementation into the field of clinical analysis led to the identification of specific lipids and/or significant changes in their plasma levels in patients suffering from cancer, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, and many other diseases and pathological conditions. Profiling of lipids and determination of their plasma concentrations could also be helpful in the case of drug therapy management, especially in combination with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Here, for the first time, a combined approach based on the TDM of colistin, a last-resort antibiotic, and lipidomic profiling is presented in a case study of a critically ill male patient suffering from ",2024,capillary electrophoresis; colistin; critically ill patients; lipidomics; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; therapeutic drug monitoring,,"Gerhardtova, I; Cizmarova, I; Jankech, T; Olesova, D; Jampilek, J; Parrak, V; Nemergutova, K; Sopko, L; Piestansky, J; Kovac, A"

Brain Injury Biomarkers and Applications in Neurological Diseases.,"Neurological diseases are a major health concern, and brain injury is a typical pathological process in various neurological disorders. Different biomarkers in the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid are associated with specific physiological and pathological processes. They are vital in identifying, diagnosing, and treating brain injuries. In this review, we described biomarkers for neuronal cell body injury (neuron-specific enolase, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1, αII-spectrin), axonal injury (neurofilament proteins, tau), astrocyte injury (S100β, glial fibrillary acidic protein), demyelination (myelin basic protein), autoantibodies, and other emerging biomarkers (extracellular vesicles, microRNAs). We aimed to summarize the applications of these biomarkers and their related interests and limits in the diagnosis and prognosis for neurological diseases, including traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and infection. In addition, a reasonable outlook for brain injury biomarkers as ideal detection tools for neurological diseases is presented.",2024,,,"Zhang, H; Wang, J; Qu, Y; Yang, Y; Guo, ZN"
Altered brain expression and cerebrospinal fluid levels of TIMP4 in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a highly prevalent and progressive pathology, involving amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the cerebral blood vessel walls. CAA is associated with an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH). Insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with CAA pathology is urgently needed, to develop additional diagnostic tools to allow for reliable and early diagnosis of CAA and to obtain novel leads for the development of targeted therapies. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 4 (TIMP4) is associated with cardiovascular functioning and disease and has been linked to vascular dementia. Using immunohistochemistry, we studied occipital brain tissue samples of 57 patients with CAA (39 without ICH and 18 with ICH) and 42 controls, and semi-quantitatively assessed expression levels of TIMP4.

Association of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Polymorphisms With Serological Lipid and Inflammatory Markers.,"Background  The study aims to assess the association of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphisms with serological lipid and inflammatory markers to determine their potential role in predicting the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Methodology  A total of 915 individuals underwent testing for lipid and inflammatory biomarkers at Vibrant America Clinical Laboratory. Clinical data, blood lipid and inflammatory profiles, and APOE genotyping were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).  Results Compared to the E3/E3 genotype, individuals with E2/E3 genotypes showed higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, apolipoprotein A (APOA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). E2/E4 genotype carriers had higher levels of HDL, triglycerides, Lp(a), and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (BNPNT). E3/E4 genotypes were associated with elevated levels of total cholesterol, LDL, Lp(a), hs-CRP, small-density low-density lipoprotein (SDLDL), oxidized LDL (OXLDL), MPO, LDL-CAL, PLAC, and APOB. The E4/E4 group displayed higher concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL, APOB, Lp(a), hs-CRP, SDLDL, OXLDL, MPO, LDLCAL, and PLAC compared to E3/E3 carriers. These findings highlight the potential atherogenic effect of the ε4 allele and the protective effect of the ε2 allele based on lipid and inflammatory marker profiles.  Conclusions This study provides strong evidence linking APOE gene polymorphism to abnormal serum lipid and inflammatory profiles. Individuals carrying the ε4 alleles exhibited dysregulated lipid metabolism and abnormal inflammatory markers, increasing their risk of CVD and AD. Early detection and prompt diagnosis are crucial for implementing therapeutic, dietary, and lifestyle interventions to mitigate risks and prevent or delay lipid and inflammation-related disorders.",2024,alzheimer's disease; apoe genotypes; apolipoprotein e; cardiovascular risk; e3/e3; e4/e4; hscrp; inflammation; ldl; lipids,,"Krishnamurthy, HK; Rajavelu, I; Reddy, S; Pereira, M; Jayaraman, V; Krishna, K; Song, Q; Wang, T; Bei, K; Rajasekaran, JJ"

Target engagement and immunogenicity of an active immunotherapeutic targeting pathological α-synuclein: a phase 1 placebo-controlled trial.,"Investigational therapeutics that target toxic species of α-synuclein (αSyn) aim to slow down or halt disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here this 44-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center phase 1 study investigated safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of UB-312, an active immunotherapeutic targeting pathological αSyn, in patients with PD. The primary outcome measures were adverse event frequency and change in anti-αSyn antibody titers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Exploratory outcomes were changes in clinical scales and biomarker-based target engagement as measured by seed amplification assays. Twenty patients were randomized 7:3 (UB-312:placebo) into 300/100/100 μg or 300/300/300 μg (weeks 1, 5 and 13) intramuscular prime-boost dose groups. Safety was similar across groups; adverse events were mostly mild and transient. Two patients experienced three serious adverse events in total, one possibly treatment related; all resolved without sequalae. Anti-αSyn antibodies in serum from 12/13 and CSF from 5/13 patients who received three UB-312 doses confirmed immunogenicity. Mean serum titers (in log-dilution factor) increased from baseline by 1.398 and 1.354, and peaked at week 29 at 2.520 and 2.133, for 300/100/100 μg and 300/300/300 μg, respectively. CSF titers were 0 at baseline and were 0.182 and 0.032 at week 21, respectively. Exploratory analyses showed no statistical differences in clinical scales but a significant reduction of αSyn seeds in CSF of a subset of UB-312-treated patients.

Brain responses to intermittent fasting and the healthy living diet in older adults.,"Diet may promote brain health in metabolically impaired older individuals. In an 8-week randomized clinical trial involving 40 cognitively intact older adults with insulin resistance, we examined the effects of 5:2 intermittent fasting and the healthy living diet on brain health. Although intermittent fasting induced greater weight loss, the two diets had comparable effects in improving insulin signaling biomarkers in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles, decreasing the brain-age-gap estimate (reflecting the pace of biological aging of the brain) on magnetic resonance imaging, reducing brain glucose on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and improving blood biomarkers of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with minimal changes in cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Intermittent fasting and healthy living improved executive function and memory, with intermittent fasting benefiting more certain cognitive measures. In exploratory analyses, sex, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E and SLC16A7 genotypes modulated diet effects. The study provides a blueprint for assessing brain effects of dietary interventions and motivates further research on intermittent fasting and continuous diets for brain health optimization.

Central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles: the next generation of neural circulating biomarkers?,"The central nervous system (CNS) is integrated by glial and neuronal cells, and both release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in CNS homeostasis. EVs could be one of the best candidates to operate as nanosized biological platforms for analysing multidimensional bioactive cargos, which are protected during systemic circulation of EVs. Having a window into the molecular level processes that are happening in the CNS could open a new avenue in CNS research. This raises a particular point of interest: can CNS-derived EVs in blood serve as circulating biomarkers that reflect the pathological status of neurological diseases? L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) is a widely reported biomarker to identify CNS-derived EVs in peripheral blood. However, it has been demonstrated that L1CAM is also expressed outside the CNS. Given that principal data related to neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease were obtained using L1CAM-positive EVs, efforts to overcome present challenges related to its specificity are required. In this sense, other surface biomarkers for CNS-derived EVs, such as glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), among others, have started to be used. Establishing a panel of EV biomarkers to analyse CNS-derived EVs in blood could increase the specificity and sensitivity necessary for these types of studies. This review covers the main evidence related to CNS-derived EVs in cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples of patients with neurological diseases, focusing on the reported biomarkers and the technical possibilities for their isolation. EVs are emerging as a mirror of brain physiopathology, reflecting both localized and systemic changes. Therefore, when the technical hindrances for EV research and clinical applications are overcome, novel disease-specific panels of EV biomarkers would be discovered to facilitate transformation from traditional medicine to personalized medicine.",2024,Brain-derived EVs; Central nervous system-derived EVs; Cerebrospinal fluid EVs; Circulating biomarkers; Extracellular vesicles; Neural-derived EVs; Neurodegenerative diseases; Plasma EVs,Humans; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Central Nervous System; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Animals,"Bravo-Miana, RDC; Arizaga-Echebarria, JK; Otaegui, D"

Rosuvastatin attenuates total-tau serum levels and increases expression of miR-124-3p in dyslipidemic Alzheimer's patients: a historic cohort study.,"microRNAs are candidate diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to compare Silymarin with Rosuvastatin and placebo on total-Tau protein level and expression levels of microRNAs and TGF-β and COX-2 in Alzheimer's patients with secondary dyslipidemia. 36 mild AD patients with dyslipidemia were divided into three groups of 12. The first group received silymarin (140mg), the second group received placebo (140mg), and the third group recieved Rosuvastatin (10mg). Tablets were administered three times a day for Six months. The blood samples of the patients were collected before and after the intervention and the serum was separated. Using the RT-qPCR method, the expression levels of miR-124-3p and miR-125b-5p were assessed, and the serum levels of total-Tau, TGF-β, and COX-2 enzyme were measured using the ELISA method. Data were analyzed with SPSS software. In this study, the level of Δtotal-Tau was significantly lower in the Rosuvastatin group compared to the placebo (P = 0.038). Also, a significant reduction in the level of ΔTGF-β was observed in the Silymarin to Rosuvastatin group (p = 0.046) and ΔmiR-124-3p was significantly increased in the Rosuvastatin compared to the placebo group (p = 0.044). Rosuvastatin outperformed silymarin in decreasing Δtotal-Tau serum levels and enhancing expression of ΔmiR-124-3p, attributed to Rosuvastatin's capacity to lower cholesterol levels and inflammation concurrently. Conversely, silymarin was more effective than Rosuvastatin in reducing levels of ΔTGF-β.

Plasma extracellular vesicle tau and TDP-43 as diagnostic biomarkers in FTD and ALS.,"Minimally invasive biomarkers are urgently needed to detect molecular pathology in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we show that plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain quantifiable amounts of TDP-43 and full-length tau, which allow the quantification of 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) tau isoforms. Plasma EV TDP-43 levels and EV 3R/4R tau ratios were determined in a cohort of 704 patients, including 37 genetically and 31 neuropathologically proven cases. Diagnostic groups comprised patients with TDP-43 proteinopathy ALS, 4R tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy, behavior variant FTD (bvFTD) as a group with either tau or TDP-43 pathology, and healthy controls. EV tau ratios were low in progressive supranuclear palsy and high in bvFTD with tau pathology. EV TDP-43 levels were high in ALS and in bvFTD with TDP-43 pathology. Both markers discriminated between the diagnostic groups with area under the curve values >0.9, and between TDP-43 and tau pathology in bvFTD.

Advances in blood biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD): A review.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are growing public health challenges globally affecting millions of older adults, necessitating concerted efforts to advance our understanding and management of these conditions. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles that are the primary cause of dementia in older individuals. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD dementia is crucial for effective intervention and treatment but has proven challenging to accomplish. Although testing for AD brain pathology with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) has been available for over 2 decades, most patients never underwent this testing because of inaccessibility, high out-of-pocket costs, perceived risks, and the lack of AD-specific treatments. However, in recent years, rapid progress has been made in developing blood biomarkers for AD/ADRD. Consequently, blood biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for non-invasive and cost-effective diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of AD progression. This review presents the evolving landscape of blood biomarkers in AD/ADRD and explores their potential applications in clinical practice for early detection, prognosis, and therapeutic interventions. It covers recent advances in blood biomarkers, including amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, tau protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). It also discusses their diagnostic and prognostic utility while addressing associated challenges and limitations. Future research directions in this rapidly evolving field are also proposed.",2024,Alzheimer disease; blood test; blood‐based biomarkers; diagnosis; plasma biomarkers,,"Assfaw, AD; Schindler, SE; Morris, JC"

Development of quantitative detection methods for four Alzheimer's disease specific biomarker panels using electrochemical immunosensors based on enzyme immunoassay.,"Accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is necessary to maximize the effectiveness of treatment and using biomarkers for diagnosis is attracting attention as a minimally invasive method with few side effects. Electrochemical immunosensor (EI) is a method that is in the spotlight in the medical and bioanalytical fields due to its portability and field usability. Here, we quantified four AD specific biomarkers using EIs based on enzyme immunoassay. We selected and developed quantitative methods for the biomarkers using screen-printed gold electrodes. For three biomarkers, quantification was performed using competition immunoassays in which antigen-antibody premix mixtures were applied to antigen-immobilized electrodes and the limit of detection (LOD) values were secured, 1.20 ng/ml, 1.30 ng/ml, and 1.74 ng/ml, respectively. For the other, a sandwich immunoassay using antibody pair was selected for quantification and LOD was also achieved as 0.077 ng/ml. All four biomarkers in buffer samples were successfully quantified and reliable R",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Blood biomarker; Electrochemical immunosensor; Multi-biomarker,,"Park, IK; Choi, YS; Jo, SY"
What Are the Reliable Plasma Biomarkers for Mild Cognitive Impairment? A Clinical 4D Proteomics Study and Validation.,"At present, Alzheimer's disease (AD) lacks effective treatment means, and early diagnosis and intervention are the keys to treatment. Therefore, for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients, blood sample analysis using the 4D nonstandard (label-free) proteomic in-depth quantitative analysis, looking for specific protein marker expression differences, is important. These marker levels change as AD progresses, and the analysis of these biomarkers changes with this method, which has the potential to show the degree of disease progression and can be used for the diagnosis and preventive treatment of MCI and AD.",2024,,"Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Proteomics; Biomarkers; Aged; Female; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged","Hou, Z; Sun, A; Li, Y; Song, X; Liu, S; Hu, X; Luan, Y; Guan, H; He, C; Sun, Y; Chen, J"
"The potential of five c-miRNAs as serum biomarkers for Late-Onset Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: miR-10a-5p, miR-29b-2-5p, miR-125a-5p, miR-342-3p, and miR-708-5p.","The nervous system is rich in miRNAs, indicating an important role of these molecules in regulating processes associated with cognition, memory, and others. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative imbalances involving such miRNAs may be involved in dementia contexts, including Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD). To test the viability of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) as biomarkers for LOAD, we proceed accordingly to the following reasoning. The first stage was to discover and identify profile of c-miRNAs by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). For this purpose, blood serum samples were used from LOAD patients (n = 5) and cognitively healthy elderly control group (CTRL_CH) (n = 5), all over 70 years old. We identified seven c-miRNAs differentially expressed (p ≤ 0.05) in the serum of LOAD patients compared to CTRL_CH (miR-10a-5p; miR-29b-2-5p; miR-125a-5p; miR-342-3p, miR-708-5p, miR-380-5p and miR-340-3p). Of these, five (p ≤ 0.01) were selected for in silico analysis (miR-10a-5p; miR-29b-2-5p; miR-125a-5p; miR-342-3p, miR-708-5p), for which 44 relevant target genes were found regulated by these c-miRNAs and related to LOAD. Through the analysis of these target genes in databases, it was possible to observe that they have functions related to the development and progress of LOAD, directly or indirectly connecting the different Alzheimer's pathways. Thus, this work found five promising serum c-miRNAs as options for biomarkers contributing to LOAD diagnosis. Our study shows the complex network between these molecules and LOAD, supporting the relevance of studies using c-miRNAs in dementia contexts.",2024,Blood–brain barrier; Circulating miRNAs; Dementia; Neurodegeneration; Target mRNAs; miRNAs databases,,"de Lourdes Signorini-Souza, I; Tureck, LV; Batistela, MS; Coutinho de Almeida, R; Monteiro de Almeida, S; Furtado-Alle, L; Lehtonen Rodrigues Souza, R"

Accurate and highly sensitive detection of Alzheimer's disease-related extracellular vesicles via förster resonance energy transfer.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and poses a huge challenge to global healthcare. Early and accurate detection of amyloid-β (1-42) (Aβ42), a key biomarker of AD, is crucial for effective diagnosis and intervention of AD. Specific or overexpressed proteins on extracellular vesicles (EVs) describe a close correlation with the occurrence and development of diseases. EVs are a very promising non-invasive biomarker for the diagnosis of AD and other diseases. As a sensitive, simple and rapid analytical method, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been widely applied in the detection of EVs. Herein, we developed a dual labelling strategy for simultaneously detecting EV membrane proteins of Aβ42 and CD63 based on FRET pair consisting of Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) and polydopamine nanospheres (PDANSs).

Protein fibril aggregation on red blood cells: a potential biomarker to distinguish neurodegenerative diseases from healthy aging.,"Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins into fibrils in the brain. Atomic force microscopy is a nanoscale imaging technique that can be used to resolve and quantify protein aggregates from oligomers to fibrils. Recently, we characterized protein fibrillar aggregates adsorbed on the surface of red blood cells with atomic force microscopy from patients with neurocognitive disorders, suggesting a novel Alzheimer's disease biomarker. However, the age association of fibril deposits on red blood cells has not yet been studied in detail in healthy adults. Here, we used atomic force microscopy to visualize and quantify fibril coverage on red blood cells in 50 healthy adults and 37 memory clinic patients. Fibrillar protein deposits sporadically appeared in healthy individuals but were much more prevalent in patients with neurodegenerative disease, especially those with Alzheimer's disease as confirmed by positive CSF amyloid beta 1-42/1-40 ratios. The prevalence of fibrils on the red blood cell surface did not significantly correlate with age in either healthy individuals or Alzheimer's disease patients. The overlap in fibril prevalence on red blood cells between Alzheimer's disease and amyloid-negative patients suggests that fibril deposition on red blood cells could occur in various neurodegenerative diseases. Quantifying red blood cell protein fibril morphology and prevalence on red blood cells could serve as a sensitive biomarker for neurodegeneration, distinguishing between healthy individuals and those with neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies that combine atomic force microscopy with immunofluorescence techniques in larger-scale studies could further identify the chemical nature of these fibrils, paving the way for a comprehensive, non-invasive biomarker platform for neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,aging; atomic force microscopy; neurodegenerative diseases; protein fibril aggregation; red blood cells,,"Schneider, TR; Stöckli, L; Felbecker, A; Nirmalraj, PN"
Revolutionary multi-omics analysis revealing prognostic signature of thyroid cancer and subsequent in vitro validation of SNAI1 in mediating thyroid cancer progression through EMT.,"Thyroid carcinoma (TC), the most commonly diagnosed malignancy of the endocrine system, has witnessed a significant rise in incidence over the past few decades. The integration of scRNA-seq with other sequencing approaches offers researchers a distinct perspective to explore mechanisms underlying TC progression. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a prognostic model for TC patients by utilizing a multi-omics approach. We acquired and processed transcriptomic data from the TCGA-THCA dataset, including mRNA expression profiles, lncRNA expression profiles, miRNA expression profiles, methylation chip data, gene mutation data, and clinical data. We constructed a tumor-related risk model using machine learning methods and developed a consensus machine learning-driven signature (CMLS) for accurate and stable prediction of TC patient outcomes. 2 strains of undifferentiated TC cell lines and 1 strain of PTC cell line were utilized for in vitro validation. mRNA, protein levels of hub genes, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated phenotypes were detected by a series of in vitro experiments. We identified 3 molecular subtypes of TC based on integrated multi-omics clustering algorithms, which were associated with overall survival and displayed distinct molecular features. We developed a CMLS based on 28 hub genes to predict patient outcomes, and demonstrated that CMLS outperformed other prognostic models. TC patients of relatively lower CMLS score had significantly higher levels of T cells, B cells, and macrophages, indicating an immune-activated state. Fibroblasts were predominantly enriched in the high CMLS group, along with markers associated with immune suppression and evasion. We identified several drugs that could be suitable for patients with high CMLS, including Staurosporine_1034, Rapamycin_1084, gemcitabine, and topotecan. SNAI1 was elevated in both undifferentiated TC cell lines, comparing to PTC cells. Knockdown of SNAI1 reduced the cell proliferation and EMT phenotypes of undifferentiated TC cells. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-omics analysis in understanding the molecular subtypes and immune characteristics of TC, and provide a novel prognostic model and potential therapeutic targets for this disease. Moreover, we identified SNAI1 in mediating TC progression through EMT in vitro.",2024,EMT; Multi-omics analysis; Prognostic model; Proliferation; SNAI1; Thyroid cancer,"Humans; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Thyroid Neoplasms; Prognosis; Snail Family Transcription Factors; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Progression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Biomarkers, Tumor; Machine Learning; Transcriptome; Multiomics","Jin, X; Fu, C; Qi, J; Chen, C"
Single-extracellular vesicle (EV) analyses validate the use of L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM) as a reliable biomarker of neuron-derived EVs.,"Isolation of neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) with L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM)-specific antibodies has been widely used to identify blood biomarkers of CNS disorders. However, full methodological validation requires demonstration of L1CAM in individual NDEVs and lower levels or absence of L1CAM in individual EVs from other cells. Here, we used multiple single-EV techniques to establish the neuronal origin and determine the abundance of L1CAM-positive EVs in human blood. L1CAM epitopes of the ectodomain are shown to be co-expressed on single-EVs with the neuronal proteins β-III-tubulin, GAP43, and VAMP2, the levels of which increase in parallel with the enrichment of L1CAM-positive EVs. Levels of L1CAM-positive EVs carrying the neuronal proteins VAMP2 and β-III-tubulin range from 30% to 63%, in contrast to 0.8%-3.9% of L1CAM-negative EVs. Plasma fluid-phase L1CAM does not bind to single-EVs. Our findings support the use of L1CAM as a target for isolating plasma NDEVs and leveraging their cargo to identify biomarkers reflecting neuronal function.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; L1CAM; blood biomarkers; extracellular vesicles; neuron‐derived extracellular vesicles,Humans; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Neurons; Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 2; Tubulin,"Nogueras-Ortiz, CJ; Eren, E; Yao, P; Calzada, E; Dunn, C; Volpert, O; Delgado-Peraza, F; Mustapic, M; Lyashkov, A; Rubio, FJ; Vreones, M; Cheng, L; You, Y; Hill, AF; Ikezu, T; Eitan, E; Goetzl, EJ; Kapogiannis, D"

Acceptable performance of blood biomarker tests of amyloid pathology - recommendations from the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Anti-amyloid treatments for early symptomatic Alzheimer disease have recently become clinically available in some countries, which has greatly increased the need for biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology. Blood biomarker (BBM) tests for amyloid pathology are more acceptable, accessible and scalable than amyloid PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, but have highly variable levels of performance. The Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease convened a BBM Workgroup to consider the minimum acceptable performance of BBM tests for clinical use. Amyloid PET status was identified as the reference standard. For use as a triaging test before subsequent confirmatory tests such as amyloid PET or CSF tests, the BBM Workgroup recommends that a BBM test has a sensitivity of ≥90% with a specificity of ≥85% in primary care and ≥75-85% in secondary care depending on the availability of follow-up testing. For use as a confirmatory test without follow-up tests, a BBM test should have performance equivalent to that of CSF tests - a sensitivity and specificity of ~90%. Importantly, the predictive values of all biomarker tests vary according to the pre-test probability of amyloid pathology and must be interpreted in the complete clinical context. Use of BBM tests that meet these performance standards could enable more people to receive an accurate and timely Alzheimer disease diagnosis and potentially benefit from new treatments.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Schindler, SE; Galasko, D; Pereira, AC; Rabinovici, GD; Salloway, S; Suárez-Calvet, M; Khachaturian, AS; Mielke, MM; Udeh-Momoh, C; Weiss, J; Batrla, R; Bozeat, S; Dwyer, JR; Holzapfel, D; Jones, DR; Murray, JF; Partrick, KA; Scholler, E; Vradenburg, G; Young, D; Algeciras-Schimnich, A; Aubrecht, J; Braunstein, JB; Hendrix, J; Hu, YH; Mattke, S; Monane, M; Reilly, D; Somers, E; Teunissen, CE; Shobin, E; Vanderstichele, H; Weiner, MW; Wilson, D; Hansson, O"
A probe for NIR-II imaging and multimodal analysis of early Alzheimer's disease by targeting CTGF.,"To date, earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still challenging. Recent studies revealed the elevated expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in AD brain is an upstream regulator of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque, thus CTGF could be an earlier diagnostic biomarker of AD than Aβ plaque. Herein, we develop a peptide-coated gold nanocluster that specifically targets CTGF with high affinity (KD ~ 21.9 nM). The probe can well penetrate the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) of APP/PS1 transgenic mice at early-stage (earlier than 3-month-old) in vivo, allowing non-invasive NIR-II imaging of CTGF when there is no appearance of Aβ plaque deposition. Notably, this probe can also be applied to measuring CTGF on postmortem brain sections by multimodal analysis, including fluorescence imaging, peroxidase-like chromogenic imaging, and ICP-MS quantitation, which enables distinguishment between the brains of AD patients and healthy people. This probe possesses great potential for precise diagnosis of earlier AD before Aβ plaque formation.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Connective Tissue Growth Factor; Animals; Mice, Transgenic; Humans; Mice; Brain; Gold; Blood-Brain Barrier; Plaque, Amyloid; Metal Nanoparticles; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Female; Male; Multimodal Imaging; Biomarkers; Optical Imaging","Lu, C; Meng, C; Li, Y; Yuan, J; Ren, X; Gao, L; Su, D; Cao, K; Cui, M; Yuan, Q; Gao, X"

Alzheimer disease blood biomarkers: considerations for population-level use.,"In the past 5 years, we have witnessed the first approved Alzheimer disease (AD) disease-modifying therapy and the development of blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) to aid the diagnosis of AD. For many reasons, including accessibility, invasiveness and cost, BBMs are more acceptable and feasible for patients than a lumbar puncture (for cerebrospinal fluid collection) or neuroimaging. However, many questions remain regarding how best to utilize BBMs at the population level. In this Review, we outline the factors that warrant consideration for the widespread implementation and interpretation of AD BBMs. To set the scene, we review the current use of biomarkers, including BBMs, in AD. We go on to describe the characteristics of typical patients with cognitive impairment in primary care, who often differ from the patient populations used in AD BBM research studies. We also consider factors that might affect the interpretation of BBM tests, such as comorbidities, sex and race or ethnicity.

Hidden regulators: the emerging roles of lncRNAs in brain development and disease.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical players in brain development and disease. These non-coding transcripts, which once considered as ""transcriptional junk,"" are now known for their regulatory roles in gene expression. In brain development, lncRNAs participate in many processes, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and synaptogenesis. They employ their effect through a wide variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms through interactions with chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, and other regulatory molecules. Dysregulation of lncRNAs has been associated with certain brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cancer, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Altered expression and function of specific lncRNAs have been implicated with disrupted neuronal connectivity, impaired synaptic plasticity, and aberrant gene expression pattern, highlighting the functional importance of this subclass of brain-enriched RNAs. Moreover, lncRNAs have been identified as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for neurological diseases. Here, we give a comprehensive review of the existing knowledge of lncRNAs. Our aim is to provide a better understanding of the diversity of lncRNA structure and functions in brain development and disease. This holds promise for unravelling the complexity of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, paving the way for the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for improved diagnosis and treatment.",2024,gene regulation; long non-coding RNAs; neurogenesis; neurological disorders; neuronal development,,"Alammari, F; Al-Hujaily, EM; Alshareeda, A; Albarakati, N; Al-Sowayan, BS"
"Cognitive profile, neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.","We aimed to characterize the cognitive profile of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) patients with cognitive complaints, exploring the influence of biological and psychological factors. Participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and cognitive complaints ≥ 8 weeks post-acute phase were included. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery (NPS) and health questionnaires were administered at inclusion and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Blood samples were collected at each visit, MRI scan at baseline and at 6 months, and, optionally, cerebrospinal fluid. Cognitive features were analyzed in relation to clinical, neuroimaging, and biochemical markers at inclusion and follow-up. Forty-nine participants, with a mean time from symptom onset of 10.4 months, showed attention-executive function (69%) and verbal memory (39%) impairment.

Astrocytic-derived vascular remodeling factors are independently associated with blood brain barrier permeability in Alzheimer's disease.,"Astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) exert a pivotal role in the maintenance of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity essentially through structural support and release of soluble factors. This study provides new insights into the vascular remodeling processes occurring in AD, and reveals, in vivo, a pathological profile of astrocytic secretion involving Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, MMP-2 and Endothelin-1 (ET-1). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of VEGF, MMP-2/-9 were lower in patients belonging to the AD continuum, compared to aged-matched controls. CSF levels of VEGF and ET-1 positively correlated with MMP-9 but negatively with MMP-2, suggesting a complex vascular remodeling process occurring in AD. Only MMP-2 levels were significantly associated with CSF AD biomarkers. Conversely, higher MMP-2 (β = 0.411, p < 0.001), ET-1 levels (β = 0.344, p < 0.001) and VEGF (β = 0.221, p = 0.022), were associated with higher BBB permeability.

[Blood biomarkers open a window to brain pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease].,"Technical developments have paved the way for the development of ultrasensitive analytical methods that allow for precise quantification of brain-specific proteins in blood samples. Plasma levels of amyloid β, specifically the Aβ42/40 ratio, are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and show concordance with brain amyloidosis assessed by PET, but the overlap with normal elderly may be too large for reliable use in clinical applications. Plasma phosphorylated tau (P-tau), especially a variant called P-tau217, is markedly increased in the early symptomatic stages of AD but remains normal in other neurodegenerative disorders. Total tau (T-tau) is measurable in blood and shows most promise as a biomarker for acute neuronal injury (e.g. acute traumatic or hypoxic brain injury), where T-tau shows a fast and dramatic increase but does not work well as an AD biomarker due to contributions to blood levels from peripheral tissues. Instead, a novel method for tau protein produced only in the CNS called brain-derived tau (BD-tau) shows promise as a biomarker for AD-type neurodegeneration. Neurofilament light (NFL) levels in blood correlate tightly with levels in CSF and reflect axonal injury irrespective of the underlying cause. Increased blood NFL concentration is found in several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, but even more so in disorders such as motor neuron disease and frontotemporal dementia. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed with activation of astrocytes, and is mildly increased in AD, but is also very high also in acute brain disorders. These blood tests show promise as tools to identify AD pathophysiology in the first assessment of patients with early cognitive symptoms, also in primary care, to guide clinical management and possible admission to the specialist clinic. A two-step model will result in a very high accuracy to either predict or exclude brain amyloidosis of the Alzheimer type.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Neurofilament Proteins; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,"Blennow, K; Hansson, O"
Oxygen-enriching triphase platform for reliable sensing of femtomolar Alzheimer's neurofilament lights.,"Accurate quantification of neurofilament lights (NfLs), a prognostic blood biomarker, is highly required to predict neurodegeneration in the presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report self-oxygen-enriching coral structures with triphase interfaces for the label-free photocathodic detection of NfLs in blood plasma with femtomolar sensitivities and high reliability. In conventional photocathodic immunoassays, the poor solubility and sluggish diffusion rate of the dissolved oxygen serving as electron acceptors have necessitated the incorporation of additional electron acceptors or aeration procedures. To address the challenge, we designed the coral-like copper bismuth oxides (CBO) with robust solid-liquid-air contact boundaries that enrich the interfacial oxygen levels without an external aeration source. By optimally assembling the perfluorododecyltrichlorosilane (FTCS) and platinum (Pt) co-catalysts into the silver-doped CBO (Ag:CBO), the stable solid-liquid-air contact boundaries were formed within the sensor interfaces, which allowed for the abundant supply of air phase oxygen through an air pocket connected to the atmosphere. The Pt/FTCS-Ag:CBO exhibited the stable background signals independent of the dissolved oxygen fluctuations and amplified photocurrent signals by 1.76-fold, which were attributed to the elevated interfacial oxygen levels and 11.15 times-lowered mass transport resistance. Under the illumination of white light-emitting diode, the oxygen-enriching photocathodic sensor composed of Pt/FTCS-Ag:CBO conjugated with NfLs-specific antibodies precisely quantified the NfLs in plasma with a low coefficient of variation (≤2.97%), a high degree of recovery (>97.0%), and a limit of detection of 40.38 fg/mL, which was 140 times lower than the typical photocathodic sensor with diphase interfaces.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Femtomolar detection; High reliability; Neurofilament light; Oxygen-enrichment; Triphase system,Humans; Biosensing Techniques; Alzheimer Disease; Bismuth; Platinum; Oxygen; Copper; Limit of Detection; Biomarkers; Silver; Electrochemical Techniques; Immunoassay; Neurofilament Proteins; Animals,"Song, Y; Kim, H; Lee, J; Kim, K"

Effect of blood collection tube containing protease inhibitors on the pre-analytical stability of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers.,"The reliability of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be compromised by protease-induced degradation. This can limit the feasibility of conducting plasma biomarker studies in environments that lack the capacity for immediate processing and appropriate storage of blood samples. We hypothesized that blood collection tube supplementation with protease inhibitors can improve the stability of plasma biomarkers at room temperatures (RT). In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of blood biomarker stability in traditional ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes versus BD™ P100 collection tubes, the latter being coated with a protease inhibitor cocktail. The stability of six plasma AD biomarkers was evaluated over time under RT conditions. We evaluated three experimental approaches. In Approach 1, pooled plasma samples underwent storage at RT for up to 96 h. In Approach 2, plasma samples isolated upfront from whole blood collected into EDTA or P100 tubes were stored at RT for 0 h or 24 h before biomarker measurements. In Approach 3, whole blood samples were collected into paired EDTA and P100 tubes, followed by storage at RT for 0 h or 24 h before isolating the plasma for analyses. Biomarkers were measured with Single Molecule Array (Simoa) and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays. Both the IP-MS and Simoa methods revealed that the use of P100 tubes significantly improves the stability of Aβ42 and Aβ40 across all approaches. However, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio levels were significantly stabilized only in the IP-MS assay in Approach 3. No significant differences were observed in the levels of plasma p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL for samples collected using either tube type in any of the approaches. Supplementation of blood collection tubes with protease inhibitors could reduce the protease-induced degradation of plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40, and the Aβ42/40 ratio for the IP-MS assay. These findings have crucial implications for preanalytical procedures, particularly in resource-limited settings.",2024,Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; blood biomarkers; delayed centrifugation; preanalytical handling; protease inhibition; proteolytic processing,,"Chen, Y; Zeng, X; Diaz, JL; Sehrawat, A; Lafferty, TK; Boslett, JJ; Klunk, WE; Pascoal, TA; Villemagne, VL; Cohen, AD; Lopez, OI; Yates, NA; Karikari, TK"

Atrial Fibrillation and Cognitive Disorders.,"The prevalence of atrial fibrillation among older adults is increasing. Research has indicated that atrial fibrillation is linked to cognitive impairment disorders such as Alzheimer and vascular dementia, as well as Parkinson disease. Various mechanisms are believed to be shared between atrial fibrillation and cognitive impairment disorders. The specific pathologies and mechanisms of different cognitive disorders are still being studied. Potential mechanisms include cerebral hypoperfusion, ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction, and cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide. Additionally, circulatory biomarkers and certain infectious organisms appear to be involved. This review offers an examination of the overlapping epidemiology between atrial fibrillation and cognitive disorders, explores different cognitive disorders and their connections with this arrhythmia, and discusses trials and guidelines for preventing and treating atrial fibrillation in patients with cognitive disorders.

Development of a novel non-invasive biomarker panel for hepatic fibrosis in MASLD.,"Accurate non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)-related fibrosis are urgently needed.

A molecular gene expression signature identified from a diet-induced MASLD mouse model (LDLr-/-.Leiden) is translated into human blood-based biomarkers based on liver biopsy transcriptomic profiles and protein levels in MASLD patient serum samples. The resulting biomarker panel consists of IGFBP7, SSc5D and Sema4D. LightGBM modeling using this panel demonstrates high accuracy in predicting MASLD fibrosis stage (F0/F1: AUC = 0.82; F2: AUC = 0.89; F3/F4: AUC = 0.87), which is replicated in an independent validation cohort.

Does Physical Exercise Modify the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease in Older Persons?,"Physical exercise is well known for its benefits on brain health. However, the mechanisms through which these benefits occur remain discussed, especially in the context of cognitive conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. The present short review summarizes the findings of interventional studies that examined the effects of exercise training on the specific and non-specific biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Controlled exercise intervention studies published in the English language were selected if they assessed the effects of a physical exercise intervention of at least 2 weeks in middle-aged or older adults on one of the following biomarkers measured either in the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid or the blood: beta-amyloid, tau, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Overall, there was no strong evidence of significant effects of exercise interventions on any of the selected biomarkers. However, in specific populations, such as women with obesity, pre-diabetes, or depression, favorable changes in blood beta-amyloid concentrations were reported. Further benefits on cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid were also demonstrated in ",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; biomarkers; physical exercise; tau,,"Raffin, J"

Towards Early Diagnosis and Screening of Alzheimer's Disease Using Frequency Locked Whispering Gallery Mode Microtoroid Biosensors.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive form of dementia affecting almost 55 million people worldwide. It is characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles within the brain, leading to a pathological cascade of neuron degeneration and death as well as memory loss and cognitive decline. Amyloid beta (Aβ) is an AD biomarker present in cerebrospinal fluid and blood serum and correlates with the presence of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain. Measuring the levels of Aβ can help with early diagnosis of AD, which is key for studying novel AD drugs and delaying the symptoms of dementia. However, this goal is difficult to achieve due to the low levels of AD biomarkers in biofluids. Here we demonstrate for the first time the use of FLOWER (frequency locked optical whispering evanescent resonator) for quantifying the levels of post-mortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 in clinicopathologically classified control, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants. FLOWER is capable of measuring CSF Aβ42 (area under curve, AUC = 0.92) with higher diagnostic performance than standard ELISA (AUC = 0.82) and was also able to distinguish between control and MCI samples. Our results demonstrate the capability of FLOWER for screening CSF samples for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's pathology.",2024,,,"Gin, A; Nguyen, PD; Serrano, G; Alexander, G; Su, J"
Blood-brain barrier biomarkers.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic interface that regulates the exchange of molecules and cells between the brain parenchyma and the peripheral blood. The BBB is mainly composed of endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. The integrity of this structure is essential for maintaining brain and spinal cord homeostasis and protection from injury or disease. However, in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis, the BBB can become compromised thus allowing passage of molecules and cells in and out of the central nervous system parenchyma. These agents, however, can serve as biomarkers of BBB permeability and neuronal damage, and provide valuable information for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Herein, we provide an overview of the BBB and changes due to aging, and summarize current knowledge on biomarkers of BBB disruption and neurodegeneration, including permeability, cellular, molecular and imaging biomarkers. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for developing a biomarker toolkit that can reliably assess the BBB in physiologic and pathophysiologic states.",2024,Astrocytes; Biomarkers; Blood-brain Barrier; Brain microvascular endothelial cells; Brain pericytes; Central Nervous System; Disruption; Neurodegeneration; Neuroinflammation; Permeability,Blood-Brain Barrier; Humans; Biomarkers; Animals,"Zapata-Acevedo, JF; Mantilla-Galindo, A; Vargas-Sánchez, K; González-Reyes, RE"

[Human tau N-terminal domain-specific monoclonal antibodies: screening and application in blood detection].,"The antibodies to the microtubule-associated protein tau play a role in basic and clinical studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. With the recombinant human tau441 as the immunogen, the hybridoma cell strains secreting the anti-human tau N-terminal domain (NTD-tau) monoclonal antibodies were generated by cell fusion and screened by limiting dilution. The purified monoclonal antibodies were obtained by inducing the mouse ascites and affinity chromatography. The sensitivity and specificity of the monoclonal antibodies were examined by indirect ELISA and Western blotting, respectively. A double antibody sandwich ELISA method for detecting human tau protein was established and optimized. The results showed that the positive cloning rate of hybridoma cells was 83.6%. A stable cell line producing ZD8F7 antibodies was established, and the antibody titer in the supernatant of the cell line was 1:16 000. The antibody titer in the ascitic fluid was higher than 1:256 000; and the titer of purified ZD8F7 monoclonal antibodies was higher than 1:128 000. The epitope analysis showed that the ZD8F7 antibody recognized tau21-37 amino acid in the N-terminal domain. The Western blotting results showed that the ZD8F7 antibody recognized the recombinant human tau protein of 50-70 kDa and the human tau protein of 50 kDa in the brain tissue of transgenic AD model mice (APP/PS1/tau). With ZD8F7 as a capture antibody, a quantitative detection method for human tau protein was established, which showed a linear range of 7.8-500.0 pg/mL and could identify human tau protein in the brain tissue of AD transgenic mice and human plasma but not recognize the mouse tau protein. In conclusion, the human NTD-tau-specific monoclonal antibody and the double antibody sandwich ELISA method established in this study are highly sensitive and can serve as a powerful tool for the detection of tau protein in neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease; double antibody sandwich ELISA; microtubule-associated protein tau; monoclonal antibody,"tau Proteins; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Humans; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Recombinant Proteins; Hybridomas; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Antibody Specificity; Protein Domains; Epitopes","Yan, Z; Zhang, Y; Jiang, J; Liu, Z; Wang, H; Zhang, Y; He, J; Hong, T"

Transcriptomic Analysis of Lipid Metabolism Genes in Alzheimer's Disease: Highlighting Pathological Outcomes and Compartmentalized Immune Status.,"The dysregulation of lipid metabolism has been strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has intricate connections with various aspects of disease progression, such as amyloidogenesis, bioenergetic deficit, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and myelin degeneration. Here, a comprehensive bioinformatic assessment was conducted on lipid metabolism genes in the brains and peripheral blood of AD-derived transcriptome datasets, characterizing the correlation between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of lipid metabolism and disease pathologies, as well as immune cell preferences. Through the application of weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), modules eigengenes related to lipid metabolism were pinpointed, and the examination of their molecular functions within biological processes, molecular pathways, and their associations with pathological phenotypes and molecular networks has been characterized. Analysis of biological networks indicates notable discrepancies in the expression patterns of the DEGs between neuronal and immune cells, as well as variations in cell type enrichments within both brain tissue and peripheral blood. Additionally, drugs targeting the DEGs from central and peripheral and a diagnostic model for hub genes from the blood were retrieved and assessed, some of which were shown to be useful for therapeutic and diagnostic. These results revealed the distinctive pattern of transcriptionally abnormal lipid metabolism in central, peripheral, and immune cell activation, providing valuable insight into lipid metabolism for diagnosing and guiding more effective treatment for AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Immune status; Lipid metabolism; Transcriptomics,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Transcriptome; Brain; Gene Regulatory Networks,"Sun, Y; Jiang, M; Long, X; Miao, Y; Du, H; Zhang, T; Ma, X; Zhang, Y; Meng, H"

Considerations for biomarker strategies in clinical trials investigating tau-targeting therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.,"The use of biomarker-led clinical trial designs has been transformative for investigating amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The designs have ensured the correct selection of patients on these trials, supported target engagement and have been used to support claims of disease modification and clinical efficacy. Ultimately, this has recently led to approval of disease-modifying, amyloid-targeting therapies for AD; something that should be noted for clinical trials investigating tau-targeting therapies for AD. There is a clear overlap of the purpose of biomarker use at each stage of clinical development between amyloid-targeting and tau-targeting clinical trials. However, there are differences within the potential context of use and interpretation for some biomarkers in particular measurements of amyloid and utility of soluble, phosphorylated tau biomarkers. Given the complexities of tau in health and disease, it is paramount that therapies target disease-relevant tau and, in parallel, appropriate assays of target engagement are developed. Tau positron emission tomography, fluid biomarkers reflecting tau pathology and downstream measures of neurodegeneration will be important both for participant recruitment and for monitoring disease-modification in tau-targeting clinical trials.

Predicting exacerbation of renal function by DNA methylation clock and DNA damage of urinary shedding cells: a pilot study.,"Recent reports have shown the feasibility of measuring biological age from DNA methylation levels in blood cells from specific regions identified by machine learning, collectively known as the epigenetic clock or DNA methylation clock. While extensive research has explored the association of the DNA methylation clock with cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, its relationship with kidney diseases remains largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether the DNA methylation clock could serve as a predictor of worsening kidney function. In this pilot study involving 20 subjects, we investigated the association between the DNA methylation clock and subsequent deterioration of renal function. Additionally, we noninvasively evaluated DNA damage in urinary shedding cells using a previously reported method to examine the correlation with the DNA methylation clock and worsening kidney function. Our findings revealed that patients with an accelerated DNA methylation clock exhibited increased DNA damage in urinary shedding cells, along with a higher rate of eGFR decline. Moreover, in cases of advanced CKD (G4-5), the DNA damage in urinary shedding cells was significantly increased, highlighting the interplay between elevated DNA damage and eGFR decline. This study suggests the potential role of the DNA methylation clock and urinary DNA damage as predictive markers for the progression of chronic kidney disease.",2024,,"Humans; DNA Methylation; Pilot Projects; Male; DNA Damage; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; Kidney; Epigenesis, Genetic","Hishikawa, A; Nishimura, ES; Yoshimoto, N; Nakamichi, R; Hama, EY; Ito, W; Maruki, T; Nagashima, K; Shimizu-Hirota, R; Takaishi, H; Itoh, H; Hayashi, K"

Altering plasma lipids and liver enzyme activities via hippocampal injections of hen Lysozyme amyloid aggregates in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model: Insights into the therapeutic role of Bis (Indolyl) phenylmethane.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent form of dementia in the elderly. There is currently no effective treatment available for this disease. Diagnosis of AD typically relies on clinical manifestations and specific biomarkers. The present study investigated the impact of inducing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mice through the injection of lysozyme amyloids formed in the presence or absence of Bis (Indolyl) phenylmethane (BIPM) on alterations in plasma lipid profiles and liver enzyme activities. 24 adult Wistar rats were divided into control, Scopolamine, Lysozyme, BIPM groups and the blood samples were obtained from the groups for biochemical analysis. The findings of the study revealed significant changes in the plasma lipid profiles and liver enzyme markers of the Lysozyme group compared to the control group. The Lysozyme group exhibited elevated triglycerides (n = 6, P < 0.02) and LDL levels (n = 6, P < 0.02), reduced HDL (n = 6, P < 0.05) and cholesterol levels (n = 6, P < 0.02), and altered serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) level (n = 6, P < 0.05) compared to controls. While the level of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) did not change significantly compared to the control. BIPM groups showed no significant changes in lipid or enzyme levels compared to controls. Overall, our research has shown that BIPM has the ability to modify the structure of HEWL aggregates, thereby improving the detrimental effects associated with AD caused by these aggregates.

Comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for Alzheimer's disease classification using EEG signals and genetic information.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairments, and behavioral changes. The presence of abnormal beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain is known to be associated with AD. However, current limitations of imaging technology hinder the direct detection of these substances. Consequently, researchers are exploring alternative approaches, such as indirect assessments involving monitoring brain signals, cognitive decline levels, and blood biomarkers. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of integrating genetic information into these approaches to enhance early detection and diagnosis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of AD pathology beyond the constraints of existing imaging methods. Our study utilized electroencephalography (EEG) signals, genotypes, and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) as features for machine learning models. We compared the performance of gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to determine the optimal model. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between EEG signals and clinical manifestations, demonstrating the ability to distinguish the complexity of AD from other diseases by using genetic information. By integrating EEG with genetic data in an SVM model, we achieved exceptional classification performance, with an accuracy of 0.920 and an area under the curve of 0.916. This study presents a novel approach of utilizing real-time EEG data and genetic background information for multimodal machine learning. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of this concept, providing deeper insights into the actual condition of patients with AD and overcoming the limitations associated with single-oriented data.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Electroencephalography; Genome-wide association study; Machine learning; Polygenic risk score,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Electroencephalography; Female; Male; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine; Aged; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Algorithms","Yu, WY; Sun, TH; Hsu, KC; Wang, CC; Chien, SY; Tsai, CH; Yang, YW"

However, an elevated NLR has also been implicated in many other conditions that are risk factors for AD, prompting investigation into whether the NLR is directly linked with AD pathology or a result of underlying comorbidities. Herein, we explored the relationship between the NLR and AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Adjusting for sociodemographics, APOE4, and common comorbidities, we investigated these associations in two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the M.J. de Leon CSF repository at NYU.

Future perspective and clinical applicability of the combined use of plasma phosphorylated tau 181 and neurofilament light chain in Subjective Cognitive Decline and Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"We aimed to assess diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau181 and NfL separately and in combination in discriminating Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients carrying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology from non-carriers; to propose a flowchart for the interpretation of the results of plasma p-tau181 and NfL. We included 43 SCD, 41 MCI and 21 AD-demented (AD-d) patients, who underwent plasma p-tau181 and NfL analysis. Twenty-eight SCD, 41 MCI and 21 AD-d patients underwent CSF biomarkers analysis (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-42/1-40, p-tau, t-tau) and were classified as carriers of AD pathology (AP+) it they were A+/T+ , or non-carriers (AP-) when they were A-, A+/T-/N-, or A+/T-/N+ according to the A/T(N) system. Plasma p-tau181 and NfL separately showed a good accuracy (AUC = 0.88), while the combined model (NfL + p-tau181) showed an excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.92) in discriminating AP+ from AP- patients. Plasma p-tau181 and NfL results were moderately concordant (Coehn's k = 0.50, p < 0.001). Based on a logistic regression model, we estimated the risk of AD pathology considering the two biomarkers: 10.91% if both p-tau181 and NfL were negative; 41.10 and 76.49% if only one biomarker was positive (respectively p-tau18 and NfL); 94.88% if both p-tau181 and NfL were positive.

Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in the Retina.,"The retina is an emerging CNS target for potential noninvasive diagnosis and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have identified the pathological hallmarks of AD, including amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposits and abnormal tau protein isoforms, in the retinas of AD patients and animal models. Moreover, structural and functional vascular abnormalities such as reduced blood flow, vascular Aβ deposition, and blood-retinal barrier damage, along with inflammation and neurodegeneration, have been described in retinas of patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. Histological, biochemical, and clinical studies have demonstrated that the nature and severity of AD pathologies in the retina and brain correspond. Proteomics analysis revealed a similar pattern of dysregulated proteins and biological pathways in the retina and brain of AD patients, with enhanced inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes, impaired oxidative-phosphorylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, investigational imaging technologies can now detect AD-specific amyloid deposits, as well as vasculopathy and neurodegeneration in the retina of living AD patients, suggesting alterations at different disease stages and links to brain pathology. Current and exploratory ophthalmic imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT-angiography, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, and hyperspectral imaging, may offer promise in the clinical assessment of AD. However, further research is needed to deepen our understanding of AD's impact on the retina and its progression. To advance this field, future studies require replication in larger and diverse cohorts with confirmed AD biomarkers and standardized retinal imaging techniques. This will validate potential retinal biomarkers for AD, aiding in early screening and monitoring.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Inflammation; Neurodegenerative diseases; Retinal imaging; Retinal vascular pathology; Visual impairments,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Retinal Diseases; Retina; Animals; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Retinal Vessels","Gaire, BP; Koronyo, Y; Fuchs, DT; Shi, H; Rentsendorj, A; Danziger, R; Vit, JP; Mirzaei, N; Doustar, J; Sheyn, J; Hampel, H; Vergallo, A; Davis, MR; Jallow, O; Baldacci, F; Verdooner, SR; Barron, E; Mirzaei, M; Gupta, VK; Graham, SL; Tayebi, M; Carare, RO; Sadun, AA; Miller, CA; Dumitrascu, OM; Lahiri, S; Gao, L; Black, KL; Koronyo-Hamaoui, M"

"Alzheimer blood biomarkers: practical guidelines for study design, sample collection, processing, biobanking, measurement and result reporting.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, remains challenging to understand and treat despite decades of research and clinical investigation. This might be partly due to a lack of widely available and cost-effective modalities for diagnosis and prognosis. Recently, the blood-based AD biomarker field has seen significant progress driven by technological advances, mainly improved analytical sensitivity and precision of the assays and measurement platforms. Several blood-based biomarkers have shown high potential for accurately detecting AD pathophysiology. As a result, there has been considerable interest in applying these biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as surrogate metrics to investigate the impact of various covariates on AD pathophysiology and to accelerate AD therapeutic trials and monitor treatment effects. However, the lack of standardization of how blood samples and collected, processed, stored analyzed and reported can affect the reproducibility of these biomarker measurements, potentially hindering progress toward their widespread use in clinical and research settings. To help address these issues, we provide fundamental guidelines developed according to recent research findings on the impact of sample handling on blood biomarker measurements. These guidelines cover important considerations including study design, blood collection, blood processing, biobanking, biomarker measurement, and result reporting. Furthermore, the proposed guidelines include best practices for appropriate blood handling procedures for genetic and ribonucleic acid analyses. While we focus on the key blood-based AD biomarkers for the AT(N) criteria (e.g., amyloid-beta [Aβ]40, Aβ42, Aβ42/40 ratio, total-tau, phosphorylated-tau, neurofilament light chain, brain-derived tau and glial fibrillary acidic protein), we anticipate that these guidelines will generally be applicable to other types of blood biomarkers.

Circulating Cell Free DNA and DNA Double-Strand Breakage in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. AD is pathologically characterized by age-dependent accumulation of amyloid-β protein and the phosphorylation of tau protein in the brains of patients with AD. Clinically, manifestations of AD include cognitive decline, dementia, alterations of high-order brain functions, and movement disorders. Double-stranded DNA breaks are a lethal form of DNA damage and are typically repaired via non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. However, in AD brain, repair mechanism is disrupted, leading to a cascade of events, cognitive dysfunction, organ failure and reduced lifespan. Increased circulating cell-free DNA in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine in patients with AD, can be used as early detectable biomarkers for AD. The purpose of our article is to explore the potential uses of cell-free DNA and double-stranded DNA breaks as prognostic markers for AD and examine the recent research on the application of these markers in studies.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; cell-free DNA; dementia; double-stranded DNA breaks,,"Nguyen, M; Wood, C; Rios, A; Salter, Z; Reddy, PH"
"Association of dietary and nutritional factors with cognitive decline, dementia, and depressive symptomatology in older individuals according to a neurogenesis-centred biological susceptibility to brain ageing.","Hippocampal neurogenesis (HN) occurs throughout the life course and is important for memory and mood. Declining with age, HN plays a pivotal role in cognitive decline (CD), dementia, and late-life depression, such that altered HN could represent a neurobiological susceptibility to these conditions. Pertinently, dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean diet) and/or individual nutrients (e.g., vitamin D, omega 3) can modify HN, but also modify risk for CD, dementia, and depression. Therefore, the interaction between diet/nutrition and HN may alter risk trajectories for these ageing-related brain conditions. Using a subsample (n = 371) of the Three-City cohort-where older adults provided information on diet and blood biobanking at baseline and were assessed for CD, dementia, and depressive symptomatology across 12 years-we tested for interactions between food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional biomarker concentrations and neurogenesis-centred susceptibility status (defined by baseline readouts of hippocampal progenitor cell integrity, cell death, and differentiation) on CD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular and other dementias (VoD), and depressive symptomatology, using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models.

Dynamics of cognitive variability with age and its genetic underpinning in NIHR BioResource Genes and Cognition cohort participants.,"A leading explanation for translational failure in neurodegenerative disease is that new drugs are evaluated late in the disease course when clinical features have become irreversible. Here, to address this gap, we cognitively profiled 21,051 people aged 17-85 years as part of the Genes and Cognition cohort within the National Institute for Health and Care Research BioResource across England. We describe the cohort, present cognitive trajectories and show the potential utility. Surprisingly, when studied at scale, the APOE genotype had negligible impact on cognitive performance. Different cognitive domains had distinct genetic architectures, with one indicating brain region-specific activation of microglia and another with glycogen metabolism. Thus, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning cognition are distinct from dementia risk loci, presenting different targets to slow down age-related cognitive decline. Participants can now be recalled stratified by genotype and cognitive phenotype for natural history and interventional studies of neurodegenerative and other disorders.",2024,,"Humans; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Adolescent; Adult; Cognition; Young Adult; Female; Cohort Studies; Male; Genotype; Apolipoproteins E; Aging; England","Rahman, MS; Harrison, E; Biggs, H; Seikus, C; Elliott, P; Breen, G; Kingston, N; Bradley, JR; Hill, SM; Tom, BDM; Chinnery, PF"
Nucleic acid aptamer-based electrochemical sensor for the detection of serum P-tau231 and the instant screening test of Alzheimer's disease.,"The instant screening of patients with a tendency towards developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is significant for providing preventive measures and treatment. However, the current imaging-based technology cannot meet the requirements in the early stage. Developing biosensor-based liquid biopsy technology could be overcoming this bottleneck problem. Herein, we developed a simple, low-cost, and sensitive electrochemical aptamer biosensor for detecting phosphorylated tau protein threonine 231 (P-tau231), the earliest and one of the most efficacious abnormally elevated biomarkers of AD. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were electrochemically synthesized on a glassy carbon electrode as the transducer, exhibiting excellent conductivity, and were applied to amplify the electrochemical signal. A nucleic acid aptamer was designed as the receptor to capture the P-tau231 protein, specifically through the formation of an aptamer-antigen complex. The proposed biosensor showed excellent sensitivity in detecting P-tau 231, with a broad linear detection range from 10 to 10",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Aptamer; Au nanoparticles; Differential pulse voltammetry; Electrochemical biosensor; Phosphorylated tau protein threonine 231,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Aptamers, Nucleotide; tau Proteins; Biosensing Techniques; Electrochemical Techniques; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Limit of Detection; Phosphorylation; Biomarkers","Kong, Q; Liu, C; Zhang, Y; He, Y; Zhang, R; Wang, Y; Zhou, Q; Cui, F"
Exploring intricate connectivity patterns for cognitive functioning and neurological disorders: incorporating frequency-domain NC method into fMRI analysis.,"This study extends the application of the frequency-domain new causality method to functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Strong causality, weak causality, balanced causality, cyclic causality, and transitivity causality were constructed to simulate varying degrees of causal associations among multivariate functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals. Data from 1,252 groups of individuals with different degrees of cognitive impairment were collected. The frequency-domain new causality method was employed to construct directed efficient connectivity networks of the brain, analyze the statistical characteristics of topological variations in brain regions related to cognitive impairment, and utilize these characteristics as features for training a deep learning model. The results demonstrated that the frequency-domain new causality method accurately detected causal associations among simulated signals of different degrees. The deep learning tests also confirmed the superior performance of new causality, surpassing the other three methods in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall rates. Furthermore, consistent significant differences were observed in the brain efficiency networks, where several subregions defined by the multimodal parcellation method of Human Connectome Project simultaneously appeared in the topological statistical results of different patient groups. This suggests a significant association between these fine-grained cortical subregions, driven by multimodal data segmentation, and human cognitive function, making them potential biomarkers for further analysis of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; efficiency network; frequency-domain NC; time series simulation,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Male; Female; Connectome; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Aged; Middle Aged; Deep Learning; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Nervous System Diseases; Adult,"Wang, B"
"Tau- and α-synuclein-targeted gold nanoparticles: applications, opportunities, and future outlooks in the diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.","The use of nanomaterials in medicine offers multiple opportunities to address neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These diseases are a significant burden for society and the health system, affecting millions of people worldwide without sensitive and selective diagnostic methodologies or effective treatments to stop their progression. In this sense, the use of gold nanoparticles is a promising tool due to their unique properties at the nanometric level. They can be functionalized with specific molecules to selectively target pathological proteins such as Tau and α-synuclein for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Additionally, these proteins are used as diagnostic biomarkers, wherein gold nanoparticles play a key role in enhancing their signal, even at the low concentrations present in biological samples such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid, thus enabling an early and accurate diagnosis. On the other hand, gold nanoparticles act as drug delivery platforms, bringing therapeutic agents directly into the brain, improving treatment efficiency and precision, and reducing side effects in healthy tissues. However, despite the exciting potential of gold nanoparticles, it is crucial to address the challenges and issues associated with their use in the medical field before they can be widely applied in clinical settings. It is critical to ensure the safety and biocompatibility of these nanomaterials in the context of the central nervous system. Therefore, rigorous preclinical and clinical studies are needed to assess the efficacy and feasibility of these strategies in patients. Since there is scarce and sometimes contradictory literature about their use in this context, the main aim of this review is to discuss and analyze the current state-of-the-art of gold nanoparticles in relation to delivery, diagnosis, and therapy for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as recent research about their use in preclinical, clinical, and emerging research areas.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Diagnosis; Parkinson’s disease; Protein misfolding; Theragnosis; Therapy,Humans; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; alpha-Synuclein; tau Proteins; Animals; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Drug Delivery Systems; Biomarkers,"Tapia-Arellano, A; Cabrera, P; Cortés-Adasme, E; Riveros, A; Hassan, N; Kogan, MJ"

"A Nonlinear Relation between Body Mass Index and Long-Term Poststroke Functional Outcome-The Importance of Insulin Resistance, Inflammation, and Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein-1.","Both high serum insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (s-IGFBP-1) and insulin resistance (IR) are associated with poor functional outcome poststroke, whereas overweight body mass index (BMI; 25-30) is related to fewer deaths and favorable functional outcome in a phenomenon labeled ""the obesity paradox"". Furthermore, IGFBP-1 is inversely related to BMI, in contrast to the linear relation between IR and BMI. Here, we investigated s-IGFBP-1 and IR concerning BMI and 7-year poststroke functional outcome. We included 451 stroke patients from the Sahlgrenska Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS) with baseline measurements of s-IGFBP1, homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), BMI (categories: normal-weight (8.5-25), overweight (25-30), and obesity (>30)), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a measure of general inflammation. Associations with poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score: 3-6) after 7 years were evaluated using multivariable binary logistic regression, with overweight as reference due to the nonlinear relationship. Both normal-weight (odds-ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-4.14) and obese (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.08-4.71) patients had an increased risk of poor functional outcome, driven by deaths only in the normal-weight. In normal-weight, s-IGFBP-1 modestly attenuated (8.3%) this association. In the obese, the association was instead attenuated by HOMA-IR (22.4%) and hs-CRP (10.4%). Thus, a nonlinear relation between BMI and poor 7-year functional outcome was differently attenuated in the normal-weight and the obese.",2024,body mass index (BMI); homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1); modified Rankin Score (mRS); obesity paradox,Humans; Insulin Resistance; Body Mass Index; Female; Male; Aged; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1; Inflammation; Middle Aged; Obesity; Stroke; C-Reactive Protein; Biomarkers; Overweight; Insulin-Like Peptides,"Gadd, G; Åberg, D; Wall, A; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Jood, K; Jern, C; Isgaard, J; Svensson, J; Åberg, ND"
Assessment of the Correlation and Diagnostic Accuracy between Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers: A Comparison of the Lumipulse and Simoa Platforms.,"We compared the clinical and analytical performance of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers measured using the single-molecule array (Simoa) and Lumipulse platforms. We quantified the plasma levels of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), Aβ40, phosphorylated tau (Ptau181), and total tau biomarkers in 81 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 30 with AD, and 16 with non-AD dementia. We found a strong correlation between the Simoa and Lumipulse methods. Concerning the clinical diagnosis, Simoa Ptau181/Aβ42 (AUC 0.739, 95% CI 0.592-0.887) and Lumipulse Aβ42 and Ptau181/Aβ42 (AUC 0.735, 95% CI 0.589-0.882 and AUC 0.733, 95% CI 0.567-0.900) had the highest discriminating power. However, their power was significantly lower than that of CSF Aβ42/Aβ40, as measured by Lumipulse (AUC 0.879, 95% CI 0.766-0.992). Simoa Ptau181 and Lumipulse Ptau181/Aβ42 were the markers most consistent with the CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 status (AUC 0.801, 95% CI 0.712-0.890 vs. AUC 0.870, 95% CI 0.806-0.934, respectively) at the ≥2.127 and ≥0.084 cut-offs, respectively.

Salivary biomarkers: The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"The precise identification of Alzheimer's disease and other prevalent neurodegenerative diseases remains a difficult issue that requires the development of early detection of the disease and inexpensive biomarkers that can replace the present cerebrospinal fluid and imaging biomarkers. Blood biomarkers, such as amyloid and neurofilament light, have been emphasized as an important and practical tool in a testing or examination procedure thanks to advancements in ultra-sensitive detection techniques. Although saliva is not currently being researched for neurodegenerative diseases, it is an important source of biomarkers that can be used for the identification of diseases and has some advantages over other biofluids. While this may be true for most people, getting saliva from elderly people presents some significant challenges. In this overview, we will first discuss how saliva is created and how aging-related illnesses may affect the amount and kind of saliva produced.

Towards early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: advances in immune-related blood biomarkers and computational approaches.,"Alzheimer's disease has an increasing prevalence in the population world-wide, yet current diagnostic methods based on recommended biomarkers are only available in specialized clinics. Due to these circumstances, Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed late, which contrasts with the currently available treatment options that are only effective for patients at an early stage. Blood-based biomarkers could fill in the gap of easily accessible and low-cost methods for early diagnosis of the disease. In particular, immune-based blood-biomarkers might be a promising option, given the recently discovered cross-talk of immune cells of the central nervous system with those in the peripheral immune system. Here, we give a background on recent advances in research on brain-immune system cross-talk in Alzheimer's disease and review machine learning approaches, which can combine multiple biomarkers with further information (e.g. age, sex, APOE genotype) into predictive models supporting an earlier diagnosis. In addition, mechanistic modeling approaches, such as agent-based modeling open the possibility to model and analyze cell dynamics over time.

CSF neurofilament light chain profiling and quantitation in neurological diseases.,"Neurofilament light chain is an established marker of neuroaxonal injury that is elevated in CSF and blood across various neurological diseases. It is increasingly used in clinical practice to aid diagnosis and monitor progression and as an outcome measure to assess safety and efficacy of disease-modifying therapies across the clinical translational neuroscience field. Quantitative methods for neurofilament light chain in human biofluids have relied on immunoassays, which have limited capacity to describe the structure of the protein in CSF and how this might vary in different neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we characterized and quantified neurofilament light chain species in CSF across neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases and healthy controls using targeted mass spectrometry.

Multiomics Blood-Based Biomarkers Predict Alzheimer's Predementia with High Specificity in a Multicentric Cohort Study.,"The primary criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or probable mild AD dementia rely partly on cognitive assessments and the presence of amyloid plaques. Although these criteria exhibit high sensitivity in predicting AD among cognitively impaired patients, their specificity remains limited. Notably, up to 25% of non-demented patients with amyloid plaques may be misdiagnosed with MCI due to AD, when in fact they suffer from a different brain disorder. The introduction of anti-amyloid antibodies complicates this scenario. Physicians must prioritize which amyloid-positive MCI patients receive these treatments, as not all are suitable candidates. Specifically, those with non-AD amyloid pathologies are not primary targets for amyloid-modifying therapies. Consequently, there is an escalating medical necessity for highly specific blood biomarkers that can accurately detect pre-dementia AD, thus optimizing amyloid antibody prescription.",2024,Alzheimer’s predementia; Blood-based biomarkers; animal model; machine learning; mass spectrometry,Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Male; Female; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Animals; Cohort Studies; Prodromal Symptoms; Multiomics,"Souchet, B; Michaïl, A; Heuillet, M; Dupuy-Gayral, A; Haudebourg, E; Pech, C; Berthemy, AA; Autelitano, F; Billoir, B; Domoto-Reilly, K; Fowler, C; Grabowski, T; Jayadev, S; Masters, CL; Braudeau, J"

Personalized whole-brain neural mass models reveal combined Aβ and tau hyperexcitable influences in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuronal dysfunction and cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are likely caused by multiple pathophysiological factors. However, mechanistic evidence in humans remains scarce, requiring improved non-invasive techniques and integrative models. We introduce personalized AD computational models built on whole-brain Wilson-Cowan oscillators and incorporating resting-state functional MRI, amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau-PET from 132 individuals in the AD spectrum to evaluate the direct impact of toxic protein deposition on neuronal activity. This subject-specific approach uncovers key patho-mechanistic interactions, including synergistic Aβ and tau effects on cognitive impairment and neuronal excitability increases with disease progression. The data-derived neuronal excitability values strongly predict clinically relevant AD plasma biomarker concentrations (p-tau217, p-tau231, p-tau181, GFAP) and grey matter atrophy obtained through voxel-based morphometry. Furthermore, reconstructed EEG proxy quantities show the hallmark AD electrophysiological alterations (theta band activity enhancement and alpha reductions) which occur with Aβ-positivity and after limbic tau involvement. Microglial activation influences on neuronal activity are less definitive, potentially due to neuroimaging limitations in mapping neuroprotective vs detrimental activation phenotypes. Mechanistic brain activity models can further clarify intricate neurodegenerative processes and accelerate preventive/treatment interventions.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Male; Female; Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Models, Neurological; Biomarkers; Aged, 80 and over; Electroencephalography; Neurons","Sanchez-Rodriguez, LM; Bezgin, G; Carbonell, F; Therriault, J; Fernandez-Arias, J; Servaes, S; Rahmouni, N; Tissot, C; Stevenson, J; Karikari, TK; Ashton, NJ; Benedet, AL; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Triana-Baltzer, G; Kolb, HC; Rosa-Neto, P; Iturria-Medina, Y"

"The 2022 symposium on dementia and brain aging in low- and middle-income countries: Highlights on research, diagnosis, care, and impact.","Two of every three persons living with dementia reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The projected increase in global dementia rates is expected to affect LMICs disproportionately. However, the majority of global dementia care costs occur in high-income countries (HICs), with dementia research predominantly focusing on HICs. This imbalance necessitates LMIC-focused research to ensure that characterization of dementia accurately reflects the involvement and specificities of diverse populations. Development of effective preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches for dementia in LMICs requires targeted, personalized, and harmonized efforts. Our article represents timely discussions at the 2022 Symposium on Dementia and Brain Aging in LMICs that identified the foremost opportunities to advance dementia research, differential diagnosis, use of neuropsychometric tools, awareness, and treatment options. We highlight key topics discussed at the meeting and provide future recommendations to foster a more equitable landscape for dementia prevention, diagnosis, care, policy, and management in LMICs. HIGHLIGHTS: Two-thirds of persons with dementia live in LMICs, yet research and costs are skewed toward HICs. LMICs expect dementia prevalence to more than double, accompanied by socioeconomic disparities.

Differences were observed for selected lipid species of glycerolipids (GLs), glycerophospholipids (GPLs), lysophospholipids (LPLs) and sphingolipids (SLs) across three distinct EV subpopulations (all-cell origin, derived by immunocapture of CD9, CD81 and CD63; neuronal origin, derived by immunocapture of L1CAM; and astrocytic origin, derived by immunocapture of GLAST). The findings provide new insights into the lipid composition of EVs isolated from plasma samples regarding specific lipid families (MG, DG, Cer, PA, PC, PE, PI, LPI, LPE, LPC), as well as differences between AD and control individuals. This study emphasizes the crucial role of plasma EV lipidomics analysis as a comprehensive approach for identifying biomarkers and biological targets in AD and related disorders, facilitating early diagnosis and potentially informing novel interventions.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; exosomes; extracellular vesicles; lipid profile; neurodegenerative diseases,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Extracellular Vesicles; Lipidomics; Female; Male; Aged; Lipids; Case-Control Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Astrocytes; Middle Aged","Krokidis, MG; Pucha, KA; Mustapic, M; Exarchos, TP; Vlamos, P; Kapogiannis, D"

Unveiling New Strategies Facilitating the Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging for the Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a global impact. The past few decades have witnessed significant strides in comprehending the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and developing diagnostic methodologies for AD, such as neuroimaging approaches. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have revolutionized the field by providing valuable insights into the structural and functional alterations in the brains of individuals with AD. These imaging modalities enable the detection of early biomarkers such as amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles, facilitating early and precise diagnosis. Furthermore, the emerging technologies encompassing blood-based biomarkers and neurochemical profiling exhibit promising results in the identification of specific molecular signatures for AD. The integration of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence has enhanced the predictive capacity of these diagnostic tools when analyzing complex datasets. In this review article, we will highlight not only some of the most used diagnostic imaging approaches in neurodegeneration research but focus much more on new tools like artificial intelligence, emphasizing their application in the realm of AD.

"Serum GFAP levels correlate with astrocyte reactivity, post-mortem brain atrophy and neurofibrillary tangles.","Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a proxy of astrocyte reactivity, has been proposed as biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. However, there is limited information about the correlation between blood biomarkers and post-mortem neuropathology. In a single-centre prospective clinicopathological cohort of 139 dementia patients, for which the time-frame between GFAP level determination and neuropathological assessment was exceptionally short (on average 139 days), we analysed this biomarker, measured at three time points, in relation to proxies of disease progression such as cognitive decline and brain weight. Most importantly, we investigated the use of blood GFAP to detect the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, while accounting for potential influences of the most frequent brain co-pathologies. The main findings demonstrated an association between serum GFAP level and post-mortem tau pathology (β = 12.85; P < 0.001) that was independent of amyloid deposits (β = 13.23; P = 0.02). A mediation analysis provided additional support for the role of astrocytic activation as a link between amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pre-mortem serum GFAP and brain weight at post-mortem (r = -0.35; P < 0.001). This finding, together with evidence of a negative correlation with cognitive assessments (r = -0.27; P = 0.005), supports the role of GFAP as a biomarker for disease monitoring, even in the late phases of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the diagnostic performance of GFAP in advanced dementia patients was explored, and its discriminative power (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve at baseline = 0.91) in differentiating neuropathologically-confirmed Alzheimer's disease dementias from non-Alzheimer's disease dementias was determined, despite the challenging scenario of advanced age and frequent co-pathologies in these patients. Independently of Alzheimer's disease, serum GFAP levels were shown to be associated with two other pathologies targeting the temporal lobes-hippocampal sclerosis (β = 3.64; P = 0.03) and argyrophilic grain disease (β = -6.11; P = 0.02). Finally, serum GFAP levels were revealed to be correlated with astrocyte reactivity, using the brain GFAP-immunostained area as a proxy (ρ = 0.21; P = 0.02). Our results contribute to increasing evidence suggesting a role for blood GFAP as an Alzheimer's disease biomarker, and the findings offer mechanistic insights into the relationship between blood GFAP and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, highlighting its ties with tau burden. Moreover, the data highlighting an independent association between serum GFAP levels and other neuropathological lesions provide information for clinicians to consider when interpreting test results. The longitudinal design and correlation with post-mortem data reinforce the robustness of our findings. However, studies correlating blood biomarkers and neuropathological assessments are still scant, and further research is needed to replicate and validate these results in diverse populations.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; astrocyte; blood biomarkers; neuropathology; tau,"Humans; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Astrocytes; Female; Male; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Aged; Atrophy; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Autopsy; tau Proteins; Prospective Studies; Middle Aged; Disease Progression; Dementia","Sánchez-Juan, P; Valeriano-Lorenzo, E; Ruiz-González, A; Pastor, AB; Rodrigo Lara, H; López-González, F; Zea-Sevilla, MA; Valentí, M; Frades, B; Ruiz, P; Saiz, L; Burgueño-García, I; Calero, M; Del Ser, T; Rábano, A"

From understanding to action: Exploring molecular connections of Down syndrome to Alzheimer's disease for targeted therapeutic approach.,"Down syndrome (DS) is caused by a third copy of chromosome 21. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Both disorders have elevated Aβ, tau, dysregulated immune response, and inflammation. In people with DS, Hsa21 genes like APP and DYRK1A are overexpressed, causing an accumulation of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles, and potentially contributing to an increased risk of AD. As a result, people with DS are a key demographic for research into AD therapeutics and prevention. The molecular links between DS and AD shed insights into the underlying causes of both diseases and highlight potential therapeutic targets. Also, using biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring is an active area of research, and genetic screening for high-risk individuals may enable earlier intervention. Finally, the fundamental mechanistic parallels between DS and AD emphasize the necessity for continued research into effective treatments and prevention measures for DS patients at risk for AD. Genetic screening with customized therapy approaches may help the DS population in current clinical studies and future biomarkers.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Down syndrome; Hsa21 genes and proteins; blood based biomarkers; endosomal dysfunction; extracellular vesicles; precision therapy,,"Sukreet, S; Rafii, MS; Rissman, RA"

This study determined whether a continuous or intermittent KD (IKD) enhanced cognitive behavior in the TgF344-AD rat model of AD. At 6 months-old, TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) littermates were placed on a control (CD), KD, or IKD (morning CD and afternoon KD) provided as two meals per day for 2 or 6 months. Cognitive and motor behavior and circulating β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), AD biomarkers and blood lipids were assessed. Animals on a KD diet had elevated circulating BHB, with IKD levels intermediate to CD and KD. TgF344-AD rats displayed impaired spatial learning memory in the Barnes maze at 8 and 12 months of age and impaired motor coordination at 12 months of age. Neither KD nor IKD improved performance compared to CD. At 12 months of age, TgF344-AD animals had elevated blood lipids. IKD reduced lipids to WT levels with KD further reducing cholesterol below WT levels.

Constitutive NOS Production Is Modulated by Alzheimer's Disease Pathology Depending on APOE Genotype.,"Both the endothelial (eNOS) and the neuronal (nNOS) isoforms of constitutive Nitric Oxide Synthase have been implicated in vascular dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to explore the relationship between amyloid pathology and NO dynamics by comparing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of nNOS and eNOS of 8 healthy controls (HC) and 27 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and isolated CSF amyloid changes, stratified according to APOE ε genotype (APOE ε3 = 13, APOE ε4 = 14). Moreover, we explored the associations between NOS isoforms, CSF AD biomarkers, age, sex, cognitive decline, and blood-brain barrier permeability. In our cohort, both eNOS and nNOS levels were increased in APOE ε3 with respect to HC and APOE ε4. CSF eNOS inversely correlated with CSF Amyloid-β42 selectively in carriers of APOE ε3; CSF nNOS was negatively associated with age and CSF p-tau only in the APOE ε4 subgroup. Increased eNOS could represent compensative vasodilation to face progressive Aβ-induced vasoconstriction in APOE ε3, while nNOS could represent the activation of NO-mediated plasticity strategies in the same group.

Specific Binding of Alzheimer's Aβ Peptides to Extracellular Vesicles.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth leading cause of death among adults aged 65 and older, yet the onset and progression of the disease is poorly understood. What is known is that the presence of amyloid, particularly polymerized Aβ42, defines when people are on the AD continuum. Interestingly, as AD progresses, less Aβ42 is detectable in the plasma, a phenomenon thought to result from Aβ becoming more aggregated in the brain and less Aβ42 and Aβ40 being transported from the brain to the plasma via the CSF. We propose that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in this transport. EVs are found in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid and carry diverse ""cargos"" of bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites) that dynamically reflect changes in the cells from which they are secreted. While Aβ42 and Aβ40 have been reported to be present in EVs, it is not known whether this interaction is specific for these peptides and thus whether amyloid-carrying EVs play a role in AD and/or serve as brain-specific biomarkers of the AD process. To determine if there is a specific interaction between Aβ and EVs, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and discovered that Aβ42 and Aβ40 bind to EVs in a manner that is sequence specific, saturable, and endothermic. In addition, Aβ incubation with EVs overnight yielded larger amounts of bound Aβ peptide that was fibrillar in structure. These findings point to a specific amyloid-EV interaction, a potential role for EVs in the transport of amyloid from the brain to the blood, and a role for this amyloid pool in the AD process.",2024,amyloid; atomic force microscopy (AFM); extracellular vesicles (EVs); isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),Adult; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Peptides; Extracellular Vesicles; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Plasma,"Coughlan, C; Lindenberger, J; Jacot, JG; Johnson, NR; Anton, P; Bevers, S; Welty, R; Graner, MW; Potter, H"
Comparison of Extracellular Vesicles from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Brain Cells.,"The pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders is still poorly understood. Identification of biomarkers for these diseases could benefit patients due to better classification and stratification. Exosomes excreted into the circulatory system can cross the blood-brain barrier and carry a cell type-specific set of molecules. Thus, exosomes are a source of potential biomarkers for many diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated exosomal proteins produced from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neural stem cells, neural progenitors, neurons, astrocytes, microglia-like cells, and brain capillary endothelial cells. Of the 31 exosome surface markers analyzed, a subset of biomarkers were significantly enriched in astrocytes (CD29, CD44, and CD49e), microglia-like cells (CD44), and neural stem cells (SSEA4). To identify molecular fingerprints associated with disease, circulating exosomes derived from healthy control (HC) individuals were compared against schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) patients. A significant epitope pattern was identified for LOAD (CD1c and CD2) but not for SCZ compared to HC. Thus, analysis of cell type- and disease-specific exosome signatures of iPSC-derived cell cultures may provide a valuable model system to explore proteomic biomarkers for the identification of novel disease profiles.",2024,astrocytes; brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs); extracellular vesicles (EVs); induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD); neural differentiation; schizophrenia,Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Endothelial Cells; Proteomics; Extracellular Vesicles; Brain,"Xavier, G; Navarrete Santos, A; Hartmann, C; Santoro, ML; Flegel, N; Reinsch, J; Majer, A; Ehrhardt, T; Pfeifer, J; Simm, A; Hollemann, T; Belangero, SI; Rujescu, D; Jung, M"

Neurofilaments as biomarkers in neurological disorders - towards clinical application.,"Neurofilament proteins have been validated as specific body fluid biomarkers of neuro-axonal injury. The advent of highly sensitive analytical platforms that enable reliable quantification of neurofilaments in blood samples and simplify longitudinal follow-up has paved the way for the development of neurofilaments as a biomarker in clinical practice. Potential applications include assessment of disease activity, monitoring of treatment responses, and determining prognosis in many acute and chronic neurological disorders as well as their use as an outcome measure in trials of novel therapies. Progress has now moved the measurement of neurofilaments to the doorstep of routine clinical practice for the evaluation of individuals. In this Review, we first outline current knowledge on the structure and function of neurofilaments. We then discuss analytical and statistical approaches and challenges in determining neurofilament levels in different clinical contexts and assess the implications of neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in normal ageing and the confounding factors that need to be considered when interpreting NfL measures. In addition, we summarize the current value and potential clinical applications of neurofilaments as a biomarker of neuro-axonal damage in a range of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke and cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson disease. We also consider the steps needed to complete the translation of neurofilaments from the laboratory to the management of neurological diseases in clinical practice.",2024,,Humans; Biomarkers; Nervous System Diseases; Neurofilament Proteins; Intermediate Filaments,"Khalil, M; Teunissen, CE; Lehmann, S; Otto, M; Piehl, F; Ziemssen, T; Bittner, S; Sormani, MP; Gattringer, T; Abu-Rumeileh, S; Thebault, S; Abdelhak, A; Green, A; Benkert, P; Kappos, L; Comabella, M; Tumani, H; Freedman, MS; Petzold, A; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Leppert, D; Kuhle, J"
Cell-Free DNA As Peripheral Biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related disorders (ADRD) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases without cure. Alzheimer's disease occurs in 2 forms, early-onset familial AD and late-onset sporadic AD. Early-onset AD is a rare (~1%), autosomal dominant, caused by mutations in presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and amyloid precursor protein genes and the other is a late-onset, prevalent and is evolved due to age-associated complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors, in addition to apolipoprotein E4 polymorphism. Cellular senescence, promoting the impairment of physical and mental functions is constituted to be the main cause of aging, the primary risk factor for AD, which results in progressive loss of cognitive function, memory, and visual-spatial skills for an individual to live or act independently. Despite significant progress in the understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of AD, we continue to lack definitive early detectable biomarkers and/or drug targets that can be used to delay the development of AD and ADRD in elderly populations. However, recent developments in the studies of DNA double-strand breaks result in the release of fragmented DNA into the bloodstream and contribute to higher levels of cell-free DNA (cf-DNA). This fragmented cf-DNA can be released into the bloodstream from various cell types, including normal cells and cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis and elevated levels of cf-DNA in the blood have the potential to serve as blood blood-based biomarker for early detection of AD and ADRD. The overall goal of our study is to discuss the latest developments in circulating cell-free DNA into the blood in the progression of AD and ADRD. Our article summarized the status of research on double-strand breaks and circulating cell-free DNA in both healthy and disease states and how these recent developments can be used to develop early detectable biomarkers for AD and ADRD. Our article also discussed the impact of lifestyle and epigenetic factors that are involved in DNA double-strand breaks and circulating cell-free DNA in AD and ADRD.",2024,,,"Khemka, S; Sehar, U; Manna, PR; Kshirsagar, S; Reddy, PH"
The Olfactory Trail of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Alterations in olfactory functions are proposed as possible early biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases manifest olfactory dysfunction as a symptom, which is worth mentioning. The alterations do not occur in all patients, but they can serve to rule out neurodegenerative pathologies that are not associated with small deficits. Several prevalent neurodegenerative conditions, including impaired smell, arise in the early stages of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, presenting an attractive prospect as a snitch for early diagnosis. This review covers the current knowledge on the link between olfactory deficits and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The review also covers the emergence of olfactory receptors as actors in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Olfactory receptors are not exclusively expressed in olfactory sensory neurons. Olfactory receptors are widespread in the human body; they are expressed, among others, in the testicles, lungs, intestines, kidneys, skin, heart, and blood cells. Although information on these ectopically expressed olfactory receptors is limited, they appear to be involved in cell recognition, migration, proliferation, wound healing, apoptosis, and exocytosis. Regarding expression in non-chemosensory regions of the central nervous system (CNS), future research should address the role, in both the glia and neurons, of olfactory receptors. Here, we review the limited but relevant information on the altered expression of olfactory receptor genes in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. By unraveling how olfactory receptor activation is involved in neurodegeneration and identifying links between olfactory structures and neuronal death, valuable information could be gained for early diagnosis and intervention strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; ectopic expression; microglia; neurons; olfactory receptors,"Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Smell; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Olfaction Disorders; Receptors, Odorant","Franco, R; Garrigós, C; Lillo, J"

Functional connectivity changes in neurodegenerative biomarker-positive athletes with repeated concussions.,"Multimodal biomarkers may identify former contact sports athletes with repeated concussions and at risk for dementia. Our study aims to investigate whether biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration in former professional athletes with repetitive concussions (ExPro) is associated with worse cognition and mood/behavior, brain atrophy, and altered functional connectivity. Forty-one contact sports athletes with repeated concussions were divided into neurodegenerative biomarker-positive (n = 16) and biomarker-negative (n = 25) groups based on positivity of serum neurofilament light-chain. Six healthy controls (negative for biomarkers) with no history of concussions were also analyzed. We calculated cognitive and mood/behavior composite scores from neuropsychological assessments. Gray matter volume maps and functional connectivity of the default mode, salience, and frontoparietal networks were compared between groups using ANCOVAs, controlling for age, and total intracranial volume. The association between the connectivity networks and sports characteristics was analyzed by multiple regression analysis in all ExPro. Participants presented normal-range mean performance in executive function, memory, and mood/behavior tests. The ExPro groups did not differ in professional years played, age at first participation in contact sports, and number of concussions. There were no differences in gray matter volume between groups. The neurodegenerative biomarker-positive group had lower connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) compared to the healthy controls and the neurodegenerative biomarker-negative group. DMN disconnection was associated with increased number of concussions in all ExPro.

Increased molar ratio of free fatty acids to albumin in blood as cause and early biomarker for the development of cataracts and Alzheimer's disease.,"Cataracts and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are closely linked and are associated with aging and with systemic diseases that increase the molar ratio of free fatty acids to albumin (mFAR) in the blood. From the results of our earlier studies on the development of senile cataracts and from results recently published in the literature on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, we suggest that there is a common lipotoxic cascade for both diseases, explaining the strong connection between aging, an elevated mFAR in the blood, cataract formation, and AD. Long-chain free fatty acids (FFA) are transported in the blood as FFA/albumin complexes. In young people, vascular albumin barriers in the eyes and brain, very similar in their structure and effect, reduce the FFA/albumin complex concentration from around 650 μmol/l in the blood to 1-3 μmol/l in the aqueous humour of the eyes as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid of the brain. At such low concentrations the fatty acid uptake of the target cells - lens epithelial and brain cells - rises with increasing FFA/albumin complex concentrations, especially when the fatty acid load of albumin molecules is mFAR>1. At higher albumin concentrations, for instance in blood plasma or the interstitial tissue spaces, the fatty acid uptake of the target cells becomes increasingly independent of the FFA/albumin complex concentration and is mainly a function of the mFAR (Richieri et al., 1993). In the blood plasma of young people, the mFAR is normally below 1.0. In people over 40 years old, aging increases the mFAR by decreasing the plasma concentration of albumin and enhancing the plasma concentrations of FFA. The increase in the mFAR in association with C6-unsaturated FFA are risk factors for the vascular albumin barriers (Hennig et al., 1984). Damage to the vascular albumin barrier in the eyes and brain increases the concentration of FFA/albumin complex in the aqueous humour as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the death of lens epithelial and brain cells, the development of cataracts, and AD. An age-dependent increase in the concentration of FFA/albumin complex has been found in the aqueous humour of 177 cataract patients, correlating with the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic death of lens epithelial cells, lens opacification and cataracts (Iwig et al., 2004). Mitochondrial dysfunction is also an early crucial event in Alzheimer's pathology, closely connected with the generation of amyloid beta peptides (Leuner et al., 2012). Very recently, amyloid beta production has also been confirmed in the lenses of Alzheimer's patients, causing cataracts (Moncaster et al., 2022). In view of this, we propose that there is a common lipotoxic cascade for senile cataract formation and senile AD, initiated by aging and/or systemic diseases, leading to an mFAR>1 in the blood.",2024,Aging; Albumin; Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; Cataracts; Free fatty acids; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Vascular albumin barriers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cataract; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Biomarkers; Serum Albumin; Aging; Lens, Crystalline","Glaesser, D; Iwig, M"
"Effects of xylo-oligosaccharide on gut microbiota, brain protein expression, and lipid profile induced by high-fat diet.","Midlife overweight and obesity are risk factors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer' s disease (AD) in late life. In addition to increasing risk of obesity and cognitive dysfunction, diets rich in fats also contributes to an imbalance of gut microbiota. Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) are a kind of prebiotic with several biological advantages, and can selectively promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the gut. To explore whether XOS can alleviate cognitive decline induced by high-fat diet (HFD) through improving gut microbiota composition, mice were fed with normal control or 60% HFD for 9 weeks to induce obesity. After that, mice were supplemented with XOS (30 g or 60 g/kg-diet) or without, respectively, for 12 weeks. The results showed that XOS inhibited weight gain, decreased epidydimal fat weight, and improved fasting blood sugar and blood lipids in mice. Additionally, XOS elevated spatial learning and memory function, decreased amyloid plaques accumulation, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and improved neuroinflammation status in hippocampus. Changes in glycerolipids metabolism-associated lipid compounds caused by HFD in hippocampus were reversed after XOS intervention. On the other hand, after XOS intervention, increase in immune-mediated bacteria, Faecalibacterium was observed. In conclusion, XOS improved gut dysbiosis and ameliorated spatial learning and memory dysfunction caused by HFD by decreasing cognitive decline-associated biomarkers and changing lipid composition in hippocampus.",2024,Cognitive function; Gut microbiota; High-fat diet; Lipidomics; Xylo-oligosaccharides,"Animals; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Diet, High-Fat; Oligosaccharides; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Prebiotics; Mice; Hippocampus; Obesity; Glucuronates; Brain; Lipids; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dysbiosis; Lipid Metabolism","Teng, CY; Kao, NJ; Nguyen, NTK; Lin, CI; Cross, TL; Lin, SH"

Low TGF-β1 plasma levels are associated with cognitive decline in Down syndrome.,"Almost all individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) show the characteristic neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the age of 40, yet not every individual with DS experiences symptoms of AD later in life. Similar to neurotypical developing subjects, AD in people with DS lasts for a long preclinical phase in which biomarkers follow a predictable order of changes. Hence, a prolonged asymptomatic period precedes the onset of dementia, underscoring the importance of identifying new biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline in individuals with DS. Blood-based biomarkers may offer an alternative non-invasive strategy for the detection of peripheral biological alterations paralleling nervous system pathology in an early phase of the AD continuum. In the last few years, a strong neurobiological link has been demonstrated between the deficit of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) levels, an anti-inflammatory cytokine endowed with neuroprotective activity, and early pro-inflammatory processes in the AD brain. In this clinical prospective observational study, we found significant lower plasma TGF-β1 concentrations at the first neuropsychological evaluation (baseline = T0) both in young adult DS individuals (19-35 years) and older DS subjects without AD (35-60 years) compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Interestingly, we found that the lower TGF-β1 plasma concentrations at T0 were strongly correlated with the following cognitive decline at 12 months. In addition, in young individuals with DS, we found, for the first time, a negative correlation between low TGF-β1 concentrations and high TNF-α plasma concentrations, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is known to be associated with cognitive impairment in DS individuals with AD.

Evaluating the effect of rapamycin treatment in Alzheimer's disease and aging using in vivo imaging: the ERAP phase IIa clinical study protocol.,"Rapamycin is an inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase, and preclinical data demonstrate that it is a promising candidate for a general gero- and neuroprotective treatment in humans. Results from mouse models of Alzheimer's disease have shown beneficial effects of rapamycin, including preventing or reversing cognitive deficits, reducing amyloid oligomers and tauopathies and normalizing synaptic plasticity and cerebral glucose uptake.

Performance of SOBA-AD blood test in discriminating Alzheimer's disease patients from cognitively unimpaired controls in two independent cohorts.,"Amyloid-beta (Aβ) toxic oligomers are critical early players in the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have developed a Soluble Oligomer Binding Assay (SOBA-AD) for detection of these Aβ oligomers that contain α-sheet secondary structure that discriminates plasma samples from patients on the AD continuum from non-AD controls. We tested 265 plasma samples from two independent cohorts to investigate the performance of SOBA-AD. Testing was performed at two different sites, with different personnel, reagents, and instrumentation. Across two cohorts, SOBA-AD discriminated AD patients from cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects with 100% sensitivity, > 95% specificity, and > 98% area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.95-1.00). A SOBA-AD positive readout, reflecting α-sheet toxic oligomer burden, was found in AD patients, and not in controls, providing separation of the two populations, aside from 5 SOBA-AD positive controls. Based on an earlier SOBA-AD study, the Aβ oligomers detected in these CU subjects may represent preclinical cases of AD. The results presented here support the value of SOBA-AD as a promising blood-based tool for the detection and confirmation of AD.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Protein Structure, Secondary; Hematologic Tests; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins","Chen, A; Shea, D; Daggett, V"
Plasma brain-derived tau is an amyloid-associated neurodegeneration biomarker in Alzheimer's disease.,"Staging amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathophysiology according to the intensity of neurodegeneration could identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In blood, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) associates with Aβ pathophysiology but an AD-type neurodegeneration biomarker has been lacking. In this multicenter study (n = 1076), we show that brain-derived tau (BD-tau) in blood increases according to concomitant Aβ (""A"") and neurodegeneration (""N"") abnormalities (determined using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers); We used blood-based A/N biomarkers to profile the participants in this study; individuals with blood-based p-tau+/BD-tau+ profiles had the fastest cognitive decline and atrophy rates, irrespective of the baseline cognitive status. Furthermore, BD-tau showed no or much weaker correlations with age, renal function, other comorbidities/risk factors and self-identified race/ethnicity, compared with other blood biomarkers.

"Serum NFL and tau, but not serum UCHL-1 and GFAP or CSF SNAP-25, NPTX2, or sTREM2, correlate with delirium in a 3-year retrospective analysis.","Delirium represents a common terminal pathway of heterogeneous neurological conditions characterized by disturbances in consciousness and attention. Contemporary theories highlight the acute impairment of synaptic function and network connectivity, driven by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter imbalances. However, established biomarkers are still missing. Innovative diagnostic techniques, such as single-molecule array analysis, enable the detection of biomarkers in blood at picomolar concentrations. This approach paves the way for deeper insights into delirium and potentially therapeutic targets for tailored medical treatments. In a retrospective 3-year study, we investigated seven biomarkers indicative of neuroaxonal damage [neurofilament light chain (NFL), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCHL-1), and tau protein], microglial activation [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2)], and synaptic dysfunction [synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) and neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2)]. The analysis of 71 patients with delirium, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-AD controls revealed that serum NFL levels are higher in delirium cases compared to both AD and non-AD. This suggests that elevated NFL levels in delirium are not exclusively the result of dementia-related damage. Serum tau levels were also elevated in delirium cases compared to controls. Conversely, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SNAP-25 showed higher levels in AD patients compared to controls only. These findings add to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that serum NFL could be a valuable biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in delirium research. Although SNAP-25 and NPTX2 did not exhibit significant differences in delirium, the exploration of synaptic biomarkers remains promising for enhancing our understanding of this condition.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; delirium; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neurofilament light chain; neuronal pentraxin 2; single-molecule array; soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; tau protein,,"Piel, JHA; Bargemann, L; Leypoldt, F; Wandinger, KP; Dargvainiene, J"
Recent Advances in the Treatment and Management of Alzheimer's Disease: A Precision Medicine Perspective.,"About 60% to 70% of people with dementia have Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a neuro-degenerative illness. One reason for this disorder is the misfolding of naturally occurring proteins in the human brain, specifically β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. Certain diagnostic imaging techniques, such as amyloid PET imaging, tau PET imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Comput-erized Tomography (CT), and others, can detect biomarkers in blood, plasma, and cerebral spinal fluids, like an increased level of β-amyloid, plaques, and tangles. In order to create new pharma-cotherapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, researchers must have a thorough and detailed knowledge of amyloid beta misfolding and other related aspects. Dolopezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are among the medications now used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Another medication that can temporarily alleviate dementia symptoms is memantine, which blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. However, it is not able to halt or re-verse the progression of the disease. Medication now on the market can only halt its advance-ment, not reverse it. Interventions to alleviate behavioral and psychological symptoms, exhibit an-ti-neuroinflammation and anti-tau effects, induce neurotransmitter alteration and cognitive en-hancement, and provide other targets have recently been developed. For some Alzheimer's pa-tients, the FDA-approved monoclonal antibody, aducanumab, is an option; for others, phase 3 clinical studies are underway for drugs, like lecanemab and donanemab, which have demonstrat-ed potential in eliminating amyloid protein. However, additional study is required to identify and address these limitations in order to reduce the likelihood of side effects and maximize the thera-peutic efficacy.",2024,Alzheimer's disease anti-tau; Clinical trials; anti-amyloid; neuroprotection; precision medicine.; tautopathy,,"Shukla, D; Suryavanshi, A; Bharti, SK; Asati, V; Mahapatra, DK"
Multiomics analysis to explore blood metabolite biomarkers in an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that commonly causes dementia. Identifying biomarkers for the early detection of AD is an emerging need, as brain dysfunction begins two decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. To this end, we reanalyzed untargeted metabolomic mass spectrometry data from 905 patients enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using MS-DIAL, with 1,304,633 spectra of 39,108 unique biomolecules. Metabolic profiles of 93 hydrophilic metabolites were determined. Additionally, we integrated targeted lipidomic data (4873 samples from 1524 patients) to explore candidate biomarkers for predicting progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) in patients diagnosed with AD within two years using the baseline metabolome. Patients with lower ergothioneine levels had a 12% higher rate of AD progression with the significance of P = 0.012 (Wald test). Furthermore, an increase in ganglioside (GM3) and decrease in plasmalogen lipids, many of which are associated with apolipoprotein E polymorphism, were confirmed in AD patients, and the higher levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (18:1) and GM3 d18:1/20:0 showed 19% and 17% higher rates of AD progression, respectively (Wald test: P = 3.9 × 10",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Multiomics; Neuroimaging; Biomarkers; Lipids; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression,"Oka, T; Matsuzawa, Y; Tsuneyoshi, M; Nakamura, Y; Aoshima, K; Tsugawa, H"

The associations between type 2 diabetes and plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in the Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities (HABS-HD).,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects Latinos disproportionately. One of the reasons underlying this disparity may be type 2 diabetes (T2D) that is a risk factor for AD. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of T2D and AD blood biomarkers and the differences in these associations between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites. This study was a secondary analysis of baseline data from the observational Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities (HABS-HD) that investigated factors underlying health disparities in AD in Mexican Americans in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites. HABS-HD participants were excluded if they had missing data or were large outliers (z-scores >|4|) on a given AD biomarker. Fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured from clinical labs. T2D was diagnosed by licensed clinicians. Plasma amyloid-beta 42 and 40 (Aβ42/42) ratio, total tau (t-tau), and neurofilament light (NfL) were measured via ultra-sensitive Simoa assays. The sample sizes were 1,552 for Aβ42/40 ratio, 1,570 for t-tau, and 1,553 for NfL. Mexican Americans were younger (66.6±8.7 vs. 69.5±8.6) and had more female (64.9% female vs. 55.1%) and fewer years of schooling (9.5±4.6 vs. 15.6±2.5) than non-Hispanic Whites. Mexican Americans differed significantly from non-Hispanic Whites in blood glucose (113.5±36.6 vs. 99.2±17.0) and HbA1c (6.33±1.4 vs. 5.51±0.6) levels, T2D diagnosis (35.3% vs. 11.1%), as well as blood Aβ42/40 ratio (.051±.012 vs. .047±.011), t-tau (2.56±.95 vs. 2.33±.90), and NfL levels (16.3±9.5 vs. 20.3±10.3). Blood glucose, blood HbA1c, and T2D diagnosis were not related to Aβ42/40 ratio and t-tau but explained 3.7% of the variation in NfL (p < .001). Blood glucose and T2D diagnosis were not, while HbA1c was positively (b = 2.31, p < .001, β = 0.26), associated with NfL among Mexican Americans. In contrast, blood glucose, HbA1c, and T2D diagnosis were negatively (b = -0.09, p < .01, β = -0.26), not (b = 0.34, p = .71, β = 0.04), and positively (b = 3.32, p < .01, β = 0.33) associated with NfL, respectively in non-Hispanic Whites. To conclude, blood glucose and HbA1c levels and T2D diagnosis are associated with plasma NfL levels, but not plasma Aβ and t-tau levels.

Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and dementia in a community-dwelling Japanese older population (JPSC-AD).,"In recent years, the association between neuroinflammatory markers and dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), has attracted much attention. However, the evidence for the relationship between serum-hs-CRP and dementia including AD are inconsistent. Therefore, the relationships of serum high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) with dementia including AD and with regions of interest of brain MRI were investigated. A total of 11,957 community residents aged 65 years or older were recruited in eight sites in Japan (JPSC-AD Study). After applying exclusion criteria, 10,085 participants who underwent blood tests and health-related examinations were analyzed. Then, serum hs-CRP levels were classified according to clinical cutoff values, and odds ratios for the presence of all-cause dementia and its subtypes were calculated for each serum hs-CRP level. In addition, the association between serum hs-CRP and brain volume regions of interest was also examined using analysis of covariance with data from 8614 individuals in the same cohort who underwent brain MRI. After multivariable adjustment, the odds ratios (ORs) for all-cause dementia were 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.43), 1.68 (95%CI 1.08-2.61), and 1.51 (95%CI 1.08-2.11) for 1.0-1.9 mg/L, 2.0-2.9 mg/L, and ≥ 3.0 mg/L, respectively, compared to < 1.0 mg/L, and those for AD were 0.72 (95%CI 0.48-1.08), 1.76 (95%CI 1.08-2.89), and 1.61 (95%CI 1.11-2.35), for 1.0-1.9 mg/L, 2.0-2.9 mg/L, and ≥ 3.0 mg/L, respectively, compared to < 1.0 mg/L. Multivariable-adjusted ORs for all-cause dementia and for AD prevalence increased significantly with increasing serum hs-CRP levels (p for trend < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). In addition, the multivariable-adjusted temporal cortex volume/estimated total intracranial volume ratio decreased significantly with increasing serum hs-CRP levels (< 1.0 mg/L 4.28%, 1.0-1.9 mg/L 4.27%, 2.0-2.9 mg/L 4.29%, ≥ 3.0 mg/L 4.21%; p for trend = 0.004).

A non-targeting magnetic metal-organic framework probe for highly specific peptide-mediated precise disease monitoring.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a universal neurodegenerative disease in older adults with incurable and progressive properties, urging for precise monitoring to perform timely treatment to delay its progression. Herein, we introduced a non-targeting magnetic metal-organic framework probe coupled with high-throughput mass spectrometry, creating a rapid screening strategy for highly specific peptides associated with AD. Notably, an elution-free extraction process was proposed, significantly reducing sample preprocessing time while simultaneously ensuring the efficient detection of captured peptides. Using this elution-free extraction process, high-quality peptide profiles were rapidly extracted from the hundreds of samples from both diseased and healthy individuals. By integrating machine learning algorithms, LC-MS/MS, and Uniprot database searching, we identified three specific serum endogenous peptides (m/z = 4215.41, 2884.77 and 2704.61) closely associated with AD. Remarkably, with the use of any single specific peptide, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) values can reach approximately 0.9 during monitoring AD. Moreover, integrating three specific biomarkers provides a robust basis for machine learning algorithms to build monitoring models, with AUC value up to 1.000.

Exploring the neuroprotective role of physical activity in cerebral small vessel disease.,"Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a common neurological finding characterized by abnormalities of the small blood vessels in the brain. Previous research has established a strong connection between cSVD and stroke, as well as neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. As the search for effective interventions continues, physical activity (PA) has emerged as a potential preventative and therapeutic avenue. This review synthesizes the human and animal literature on the influence of PA on cSVD, highlighting the importance of determining optimal exercise protocols, considering aspects such as intensity, duration, timing, and exercise type. Furthermore, the necessity of widening the age bracket in research samples is discussed, ensuring a holistic understanding of the interventions across varying pathological stages of the disease. The review also suggests the potential of exploring diverse biomarkers and risk profiles associated with clinically significant outcomes. Moreover, we review findings demonstrating the beneficial effects of PA in various rodent models of cSVD, which have uncovered numerous mechanisms of neuroprotection, including increases in neuroplasticity and integrity of the vasculature and white matter; decreases in inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction; and alterations in amyloid processing and neurotransmitter signaling. In conclusion, this review highlights the potential of physical activity as a preventive strategy for addressing cSVD, offering insights into the need for refining exercise parameters, diversifying research populations, and exploring novel biomarkers, while shedding light on the intricate mechanisms through which exercise confers neuroprotection in both humans and animal models.",2024,Cerebral Small Vessel Disease; Exercise Protocols; Neurodegenerative Disease; Neuroprotection; Physical Activity; Vascular Dementia,Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Humans; Exercise; Animals; Neuroprotection; Brain,"Anderson, ME; Wind, EJ; Robison, LS"

Ultrasensitive Aptasensing Platform for the Detection of β-Amyloid-42 Peptide Based on MOF Containing Bimetallic Porphyrin Graphene Oxide and Gold Nanoparticles.,"The prompt detection of diseases hinges on the accessibility and the capability to identify relevant biomarkers. The integration of aptamers and the incorporation of nanomaterials into signal transducers have not only expedited but also enhanced the development of nanoaptasensors, enabling heightened sensitivity and selectivity. Here, the bimetallic nickel-cobalt-porphyrin metal-organic framework ((Ni + Cu)TPyP MOF) is regarded as an electron mediator, immobilization platform for an Alzheimer aptamer and to increase the electrochemical signal for the detection of the main biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid β (Aβ-42). Furthermore, the ((Ni + Cu)TPyP MOF) was combined with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), on a gold electrode (GE) to provide an efficient interface for immobilizing aptamer strands. Concurrently, the incorporation of rGO and AuNPs imparts enhanced electrical conductivity and efficacious catalytic activity, establishing them as adept electrochemical indicators. Owing to the superior excellent electrical conductivity of rGO and AuNPs, coupled with the presence of ample mesoporous channels and numerous Ni and Cu metal sites within (Ni + Cu)TPyP MOF, this nanostructure with abundant functional groups is proficient in immobilizing a substantial quantity of aptamer. These interactions are achieved through robust π-π stacking and electrostatic interactions, alongside the high affinity between the thiol group of the aptamer and AuNPs concurrently. The as-prepared ternary (Au@(Ni + Cu)TPyP MOF/rGO) nanostructure electrode exhibited an enhancement in its electrochemically active surface area of about 7 times, compared with the bare electrode and the Aβ-42 redox process is highly accelerated, so the peak currents are significantly higher than those obtained with bare GE substrate. Under the optimized conditions, the designed aptasensor had the quantitative detection of Aβ-42 with a low detection limit of 48.6 fg mL",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; aptasensor; bimetallic porphyrin MOF; gold nanoparticles; reduced graphene oxide; β-amyloid (Aβ-42),"Humans; Gold; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Metal Nanoparticles; Reproducibility of Results; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Electrochemical Techniques; Biosensing Techniques; Graphite","Vajedi, FS; Rasoolzadeh, R; Angnes, L; Santos, ECS; Silva, LPC"
Soluble Biomarkers of Cerebrovascular Pathologies.,"Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is an all-encompassing term that describes cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular origins. With the advancement of imaging and pathological studies, we now understand that VCID is often comorbid with Alzheimer disease. While researchers in the Alzheimer disease field have been working for years to establish and test blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer disease diagnosis, prognosis, clinical therapy discovery, and early detection, blood-based biomarkers for VCID are in their infancy and also face challenges. VCID is heterogeneous, comprising many different pathological entities (ischemic, or hemorrhagic), and spatial and temporal differences (acute or chronic).

Plasma p-tau212 antemortem diagnostic performance and prediction of autopsy verification of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.,"Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, including p-tau217, show high associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic change and clinical stage. Certain plasma p-tau217 assays recognize tau forms phosphorylated additionally at threonine-212, but the contribution of p-tau212 alone to AD is unknown. We developed a blood-based immunoassay that is specific to p-tau212 without cross-reactivity to p-tau217. Here, we examined the diagnostic utility of plasma p-tau212. In five cohorts (n = 388 participants), plasma p-tau212 showed high performances for AD diagnosis and for the detection of both amyloid and tau pathology, including at autopsy as well as in memory clinic populations. The diagnostic accuracy and fold changes of plasma p-tau212 were similar to those for p-tau217 but higher than p-tau181 and p-tau231. Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue slices showed prominent p-tau212 reactivity in neurofibrillary tangles that co-localized with p-tau217 and p-tau202/205. These findings support plasma p-tau212 as a peripherally accessible biomarker of AD pathophysiology.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuropathology; Plasma; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Autopsy; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Kac, PR; González-Ortiz, F; Emeršič, A; Dulewicz, M; Koutarapu, S; Turton, M; An, Y; Smirnov, D; Kulczyńska-Przybik, A; Varma, VR; Ashton, NJ; Montoliu-Gaya, L; Camporesi, E; Winkel, I; Paradowski, B; Moghekar, A; Troncoso, JC; Lashley, T; Brinkmalm, G; Resnick, SM; Mroczko, B; Kvartsberg, H; Gregorič Kramberger, M; Hanrieder, J; Čučnik, S; Harrison, P; Zetterberg, H; Lewczuk, P; Thambisetty, M; Rot, U; Galasko, D; Blennow, K; Karikari, TK"
Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's and related dementias: A review and outlook for clinical neuropsychology.,"Recent technological advances have improved the sensitivity and specificity of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Accurate quantification of amyloid-ß peptide, phosphorylated tau (pTau) isoforms, as well as markers of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain [NfL]) and neuro-immune activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40]) in blood has allowed researchers to characterize neurobiological processes at scale in a cost-effective and minimally invasive manner. Although currently used primarily for research purposes, these blood-based biomarkers have the potential to be highly impactful in the clinical setting - aiding in diagnosis, predicting disease risk, and monitoring disease progression. Whereas plasma NfL has shown promise as a non-specific marker of neuronal injury, plasma pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, and GFAP have demonstrated desirable levels of sensitivity and specificity for identification of individuals with Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. In this forward looking review, we (i) provide an overview of the most commonly used blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, (ii) discuss how comorbid medical conditions, demographic, and genetic factors can inform the interpretation of these biomarkers, (iii) describe ongoing efforts to move blood-based biomarkers into the clinic, and (iv) highlight the central role that clinical neuropsychologists may play in contextualizing and communicating blood-based biomarker results for patients.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; blood-based biomarkers; dementia; prediction,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Neuropsychology; Dementia; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Dark, HE; Duggan, MR; Walker, KA"

"Introducing neurofilament light chain measure in psychiatry: current evidence, opportunities, and pitfalls.","The recent introduction of new-generation immunoassay methods allows the reliable quantification of structural brain markers in peripheral matrices. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a neuron-specific cytoskeletal component released in extracellular matrices after neuroaxonal impairment, is considered a promising blood marker of active brain pathology. Given its sensitivity to a wide range of neuropathological alterations, NfL has been suggested for the use in clinical practice as a highly sensitive, but unspecific tool to quantify active brain pathology. While large efforts have been put in characterizing its clinical profile in many neurological conditions, NfL has received far less attention as a potential biomarker in major psychiatric disorders. Therefore, we briefly introduce NfL as a marker of neuroaxonal injury, systematically review recent findings on cerebrospinal fluid and blood NfL levels in patients with primary psychiatric conditions and highlight the opportunities and pitfalls. Current evidence suggests an elevation of blood NfL levels in patients with major depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, anorexia nervosa, and substance use disorders compared to physiological states. However, blood NfL levels strongly vary across diagnostic entities, clinical stage, and patient subgroups, and are influenced by several demographic, clinical, and analytical factors, which require accurate characterization. Potential clinical applications of NfL measure in psychiatry are seen in diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, to exclude neurodegenerative disease, in the assessment of brain toxicity for different pharmacological compounds, and in the longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. The high inter-individual variability of NfL levels and the lack of neurobiological understanding of its release are some of the main current limitations. Overall, this primer aims to introduce researchers and clinicians to NfL measure in the psychiatric field and to provide a conceptual framework for future research directions.",2024,,,"Bavato, F; Barro, C; Schnider, LK; Simrén, J; Zetterberg, H; Seifritz, E; Quednow, BB"
Isolation and usage of exosomes in central nervous system diseases.,"Exosomes are vesicles secreted by all types of mammalian cells. They are characterized by a double-layered lipid membrane structure. They serve as carriers for a plethora of signal molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. Their unique capability of effortlessly crossing the blood-brain barrier underscores their critical role in the progression of various neurological disorders. This includes, but is not limited to, diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ischemic stroke. Establishing stable and mature methods for isolating exosomes is a prerequisite for the study of exosomes and their biomedical significance. The extraction technologies of exosomes include differential centrifugation, density gradient centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, ultrafiltration, polymer coprecipitation, immunoaffinity capture, microfluidic, and so forth.

Evaluation of Exploratory Fluid Biomarker Results from a Phase 1 Senolytic Trial in Mild Alzheimer's Disease.,"Senescent cell accumulation contributes to the progression of age-related disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical trials evaluating senolytics, drugs that clear senescent cells, are underway, but lack standardized outcome measures. Our team recently published data from the first open-label trial to evaluate senolytics (dasatinib plus quercetin) in AD. After 12-weeks of intermittent treatment, we reported brain exposure to dasatinib, favorable safety and tolerability, and modest post-treatment changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory and AD biomarkers using commercially available assays. Herein, we present more comprehensive exploratory analyses of senolytic associated changes in AD relevant proteins, metabolites, lipids, and transcripts measured across blood, CSF, and urine. These analyses included mass spectrometry for precise quantification of amyloid beta (Aß) and tau in CSF; immunoassays to assess senescence associated secretory factors in plasma, CSF, and urine; mass spectrometry analysis of urinary metabolites and lipids in blood and CSF; and transcriptomic analyses relevant to chronic stress measured in peripheral blood cells. Levels of Aß and tau species remained stable. Targeted cytokine and chemokine analyses revealed treatment-associated increases in inflammatory plasma fractalkine and MMP-7 and CSF IL-6. Urinary metabolites remained unchanged. Modest treatment-associated lipid profile changes suggestive of decreased inflammation were observed both peripherally and centrally.

Disturbed sex hormone milieu in males and females with major depressive disorder and low-grade inflammation.,"Sex hormones have biological effects on inflammation, and these might contribute to the sex-specific features of depression. C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most widely used inflammatory biomarker and consistent evidence shows a significant proportion (20-30 %) of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have CRP levels above 3 mg/L, a threshold indicating at least low-grade inflammation. Here, we investigate the interplay between sex hormones and CRP in the cross-sectional, observational Biomarkers in Depression Study. We measured serum high-sensitivity (hs-)CRP, in 64 healthy controls and 178 MDD patients, subdivided into those with hs-CRP below 3 mg/L (low-CRP; 53 males, 72 females) and with hs-CRP above 3 mg/L (high-CRP; 19 males, 34 females). We also measured interleukin-6, testosterone, 17-β-estradiol (E2), progesterone, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle-stimulating and luteinising hormones, and calculated testosterone-to-E2 ratio (T/E2), free androgen and estradiol indexes (FAI, FEI), and testosterone secretion index.

CO,"Vascular pathology is the second leading cause of cognitive impairment and represents a major contributing factor in mixed dementia. However, biomarkers for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are under-developed. Here we aimed to investigate the potential role of CO2 Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR) measured with phase-contrast quantitative flow MRI in cognitive impairment and dementia. Forty-five (69 ± 7 years) impaired (37 mild-cognitive-impairment and 8 mild-dementia by syndromic diagnosis) and 22 cognitively-healthy-control (HC) participants were recruited and scanned on a 3 T MRI. Biomarkers of AD pathology were measured in cerebrospinal fluid. We found that CBF-CVR was lower (p = 0.027) in the impaired (mean±SE, 3.70 ± 0.15%/mmHg) relative to HC (4.28 ± 0.21%/mmHg). After adjusting for AD pathological markers (Aβ42/40, total tau, and Aβ42/p-tau181), higher CBF-CVR was associated with better cognitive performance, including Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA (p = 0.001), composite cognitive score (p = 0.047), and language (p = 0.004).

For each plasma biomarker, cutoffs were determined for 90%, 95%, or 97.5% sensitivity to detect tau-PET-positivity. We calculated the percentage of patients below the cutoffs (who would not undergo tau-PET; ""saved scans"") and the tau-PET-positivity rate among participants above the cutoffs (who would undergo tau-PET; ""positive predictive value""). Generally, plasma pTau217 performed best. At the 95% sensitivity cutoff in both cohorts, pTau217 resulted in avoiding nearly half tau-PET scans, with a tau-PET-positivity rate among those who would be referred for a scan around 70%. And although tau-PET was strongly associated with subsequent cognitive decline, in BioFINDER-2 it predicted cognitive decline only among individuals above the referral cutoff on plasma pTau217, supporting that this workflow could reduce prognostically uninformative tau-PET scans. In conclusion, plasma pTau217 may guide selection of patients for tau-PET, when accurate prognostic information is of clinical value.",2024,,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Workflow; Positron-Emission Tomography; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Brum, WS; Cullen, NC; Therriault, J; Janelidze, S; Rahmouni, N; Stevenson, J; Servaes, S; Benedet, AL; Zimmer, ER; Stomrud, E; Palmqvist, S; Zetterberg, H; Frisoni, GB; Ashton, NJ; Blennow, K; Mattsson-Carlgren, N; Rosa-Neto, P; Hansson, O"

Predicting early Alzheimer's with blood biomarkers and clinical features.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dementia. This study employs explainable machine learning models to detect dementia cases using blood gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and clinical data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Analyzing 623 ADNI participants, we found that the Support Vector Machine classifier with Mutual Information (MI) feature selection, trained on all three data modalities, achieved exceptional performance (accuracy = 0.95, AUC = 0.94). When using gene expression and SNP data separately, we achieved very good performance (AUC = 0.65, AUC = 0.63, respectively). Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we identified significant features, potentially serving as AD biomarkers. Notably, genetic-based biomarkers linked to axon myelination and synaptic vesicle membrane formation could aid early AD detection. In summary, this genetic-based biomarker approach, integrating machine learning and SHAP, shows promise for precise AD diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and offers novel insights for understanding and treating the disease. This approach addresses the challenges of accurate AD diagnosis, which is crucial given the complexities associated with the disease and the need for non-invasive diagnostic methods.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Blood biomarkers; Clinical features; Machine learning,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Biomarkers; Machine Learning; Early Diagnosis; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"AlMansoori, ME; Jemimah, S; Abuhantash, F; AlShehhi, A"

Integrative Multimodal Metabolomics to Early Predict Cognitive Decline Among Amyloid Positive Community-Dwelling Older Adults.,"Alzheimer's disease is strongly linked to metabolic abnormalities. We aimed to distinguish amyloid-positive people who progressed to cognitive decline from those who remained cognitively intact. We performed untargeted metabolomics of blood samples from amyloid-positive individuals, before any sign of cognitive decline, to distinguish individuals who progressed to cognitive decline from those who remained cognitively intact. A plasma-derived metabolite signature was developed from Supercritical Fluid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (SFC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. The 2 metabolomics data sets were analyzed by Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent approaches for Omics studies (DIABLO), to identify a minimum set of metabolites that could describe cognitive decline status. NMR or SFC-HRMS data alone cannot predict cognitive decline. However, among the 320 metabolites identified, a statistical method that integrated the 2 data sets enabled the identification of a minimal signature of 9 metabolites (3-hydroxybutyrate, citrate, succinate, acetone, methionine, glucose, serine, sphingomyelin d18:1/C26:0 and triglyceride C48:3) with a statistically significant ability to predict cognitive decline more than 3 years before decline. This metabolic fingerprint obtained during this exploratory study may help to predict amyloid-positive individuals who will develop cognitive decline. Due to the high prevalence of brain amyloid-positivity in older adults, identifying adults who will have cognitive decline will enable the development of personalized and early interventions.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Bimodal metabolomics; Cognitive decline; Early prediction; Metabolite signature; Multiomics integrative method,Humans; Aged; Independent Living; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Metabolomics; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers,"Tremblay-Franco, M; Canlet, C; Carriere, A; Nakhle, J; Galinier, A; Portais, JC; Yart, A; Dray, C; Lu, WH; Bertrand Michel, J; Guyonnet, S; Rolland, Y; Vellas, B; Delrieu, J; Barreto, PS; Pénicaud, L; Casteilla, L; Ader, I"

Associations of plasma proteomics and age-related outcomes with brain age in a diverse cohort.,"Machine learning models are increasingly being used to estimate ""brain age"" from neuroimaging data. The gap between chronological age and the estimated brain age gap (BAG) is potentially a measure of accelerated and resilient brain aging. Brain age calculated in this fashion has been shown to be associated with mortality, measures of physical function, health, and disease. Here, we estimate the BAG using a voxel-based elastic net regression approach, and then, we investigate its associations with mortality, cognitive status, and measures of health and disease in participants from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who had a brain MRI at visit 5 of the study. Finally, we used the SOMAscan assay containing 4877 proteins to examine the proteomic associations with the MRI-defined BAG. Among N = 1849 participants (age, 76.4 (SD 5.6)), we found that increased values of BAG were strongly associated with increased mortality and increased severity of the cognitive status. Strong associations with mortality persisted when the analyses were performed in cognitively normal participants. In addition, it was strongly associated with BMI, diabetes, measures of physical function, hypertension, prevalent heart disease, and stroke. Finally, we found 33 proteins associated with BAG after a correction for multiple comparisons. The top proteins with positive associations to brain age were growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), Sushi, von Willebrand factor type A, EGF, and pentraxin domain-containing protein 1 (SEVP 1), matrilysin (MMP7), ADAMTS-like protein 2 (ADAMTS), and heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B (HSPA1B) while EGF-receptor (EGFR), mast/stem-cell-growth-factor-receptor (KIT), coagulation-factor-VII, and cGMP-dependent-protein-kinase-1 (PRKG1) were negatively associated to brain age. Several of these proteins were previously associated with dementia in ARIC.

Circulating biomarkers of inflammaging and Alzheimer's disease to track age-related trajectories of dementia: Can we develop a clinically relevant composite combination?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a rapidly growing global concern due to a consistent rise of the prevalence of dementia which is mainly caused by the aging population worldwide. An early diagnosis of AD remains important as interventions are plausibly more effective when started at the earliest stages. Recent developments in clinical research have focused on the use of blood-based biomarkers for improve diagnosis/prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD. Unlike invasive cerebrospinal fluid tests, circulating biomarkers are less invasive and will become increasingly cheaper and simple to use in larger number of patients with mild symptoms or at risk of dementia. In addition to AD-specific markers, there is growing interest in biomarkers of inflammaging/neuro-inflammaging, an age-related chronic low-grade inflammatory condition increasingly recognized as one of the main risk factor for almost all age-related diseases, including AD. Several inflammatory markers have been associated with cognitive performance and AD development and progression. The presence of senescent cells, a key driver of inflammaging, has also been linked to AD pathogenesis, and senolytic therapy is emerging as a potential treatment strategy. Here, we describe blood-based biomarkers clinically relevant for AD diagnosis/prognosis and biomarkers of inflammaging associated with AD. Through a systematic review approach, we propose that a combination of circulating neurodegeneration and inflammatory biomarkers may contribute to improving early diagnosis and prognosis, as well as providing valuable insights into the trajectory of cognitive decline and dementia in the aging population.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Blood biomarkers; Dementia; Inflammaging biomarkers,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aging; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Abbatecola, AM; Giuliani, A; Biscetti, L; Scisciola, L; Battista, P; Barbieri, M; Sabbatinelli, J; Olivieri, F"
Multi-proteomic analyses of 5xFAD mice reveal new molecular signatures of early-stage Alzheimer's disease.,"An early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial as treatment efficacy is limited to the early stages. However, the current diagnostic methods are limited to mid or later stages of disease development owing to the limitations of clinical examinations and amyloid plaque imaging. Therefore, this study aimed to identify molecular signatures including blood plasma extracellular vesicle biomarker proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease to aid early-stage diagnosis. The hippocampus, cortex, and blood plasma extracellular vesicles of 3- and 6-month-old 5xFAD mice were analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Subsequent bioinformatics and biochemical analyses were performed to compare the molecular signatures between wild type and 5xFAD mice across different brain regions and age groups to elucidate disease pathology. There was a unique signature of significantly altered proteins in the hippocampal and cortical proteomes of 3- and 6-month-old mice. The plasma extracellular vesicle proteomes exhibited distinct informatic features compared with the other proteomes. Furthermore, the regulation of several canonical pathways (including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling) differed between the hippocampus and cortex. Twelve potential biomarkers for the detection of early-stage Alzheimer's disease were identified and validated using plasma extracellular vesicles from stage-divided patients. Finally, integrin α-IIb, creatine kinase M-type, filamin C, glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase 2, and lysosomal α-mannosidase were selected as distinguishing biomarkers for healthy individuals and early-stage Alzheimer's disease patients using machine learning modeling with approximately 79% accuracy.

In Silico Models to Validate Novel Blood-Based Biomarkers.,"Biological validation of preliminary findings is a key prerequisite in biomarker discovery. In recent years, the development of advanced large-scale sequencing technologies combined with high-throughput computational analysis methods led to the extraction of considerable amount of data from healthy and diseased tissues. Stored in large open-access repositories, these data can be accessed and interrogated by researchers aiming at understanding the biological rationale behind their results. These so called in silico analyses, in opposite to in vitro analyses, have gained increasing importance in recent years, becoming a major component of research projects and publications. However, making sense of the large amount of data available can be challenging and may lead to a misinterpretation of the data. To reduce the dimensionality of this data, recent years have seen the development of statistical m\ethods and advanced graph analytics which help researchers summarize the available data and draw appropriate conclusions.

Analysis of Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been characterized by widespread network disconnection among brain regions, widely overlapping with the hallmarks of the disease. Functional connectivity has been studied with an upward trend in the last two decades, predominantly in AD among other neuropsychiatric disorders, and presents a potential biomarker with various features that might provide unique contributions to foster our understanding of neural mechanisms of AD. The resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is usually used to measure the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals that reflect the brain's functional connectivity. Nevertheless, the rs-fMRI is still underutilized, which might be due to the fairly complex acquisition and analytic methodology. In this chapter, we presented the common methods that have been applied in rs-fMRI literature, focusing on the studies on individuals in the continuum of AD. The key methodological aspects will be addressed that comprise acquiring, processing, and interpreting rs-fMRI data.

Optimized Pre-analytical Handling Protocol for Blood-Based Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The therapeutic management of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been hindered by poor diagnostic accuracy. As such, there is an unmet clinical need for tools that can detect and diagnose the disease in its early stages. Compared with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based biomarkers or positron emission tomography (PET), the use of reliable blood-based biomarkers could offer an accessible and minimally invasive method of streamlining diagnosis in the clinical setting. However, the influence of pre-analytical processing and sample handling parameters on the accurate measurement of protein biomarkers is well established, especially for AD CSF-based biomarkers. In this chapter, we provide recommendations for an optimal sample handling protocol for the analysis of blood-based biomarkers specifically for amyloid pathology in AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Beta-amyloid; Blood-based biomarkers; Immunoassay; Phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau); Plasma; Pre-analytics; Protocol,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Jethwa, A; Stöckl, L"
Blood-Based Biomarkers for Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in Real-World Settings.,"As our knowledge about the biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) expands and we recognize the significance of early intervention for effective treatment, there is a shift in focus toward detecting the disease at an early stage. AD is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau proteins in the brain, leading to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While a definitive diagnosis of AD can only be confirmed through autopsy by examining these pathological features, there are now reliable methods available for diagnosing the disease in living individuals. These methods involve analyzing cerebrospinal fluid and using positron emission tomography to accurately assess the presence of Aβ and tau proteins. While these diagnostic markers have shown high accuracy in memory-clinic populations, they do have limitations such as the requirement for invasive lumbar puncture or exposure to ionizing radiation. Additionally, they are not easily accessible outside of specialized healthcare settings. Blood-based biomarkers of the core pathological features of AD are being developed, showing promise for less invasive, scalable identification of AD cases in the community. The advantages for the healthcare systems of this development are obvious, but the diagnostic performance of blood-based biomarkers in broader, non-selected populations outside of retrospective analyses and research cohorts still requires further investigation, including the combination with more effective neuropsychological assessments such as digital cognitive test solutions.",2024,Early and targeted treatment and prevention of neurodegeneration; Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; Patient and service user value; Scalable diagnostic technologies; Subjective cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Retrospective Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers,"Perneczky, R; Hansen, N; Hofmann, A; Laske, C; Priller, J; Grimmer, T; Frölich, L; Düzel, E; Jessen, F; Wiltfang, J"

The association of glucose metabolism measures and diabetes status with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers of amyloid and tau: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Conflicting evidence exists on the relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. Therefore, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to evaluate the correlation of glucose metabolism measures (glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance indices) and DM status with AD biomarkers of amyloid-β and tau measured by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid. We selected 37 studies from PubMed and Embase, including 11,694 individuals. More impaired glucose metabolism and DM status were associated with higher tau biomarkers (r=0.11[0.03-0.18], p=0.008; I2=68%), but were not associated with amyloid-β biomarkers (r=-0.06[-0.13-0.01], p=0.08; I",2024,Amyloid-beta; Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); Elderly persons; Fasting blood glucose (FBG); Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR); Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE); Positron emission tomography (PET); Tau; Type 2 DM mellitus (T2DM),Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diabetes Mellitus; Glucose; Peptide Fragments; Positron-Emission Tomography; tau Proteins,"van Gils, V; Rizzo, M; Côté, J; Viechtbauer, W; Fanelli, G; Salas-Salvadó, J; Wimberley, T; Bulló, M; Fernandez-Aranda, F; Dalsgaard, S; Visser, PJ; Jansen, WJ; Vos, SJB"

Association of peripheral immunity and cerebral small vessel disease in older adults without dementia: A longitudinal study.,"This study explored the associations between peripheral immunity with cerebral small vessel diseases. Older adults without dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were investigated. Peripheral blood was obtained, and magnetic resonance imaging was performed to measure cerebral microbleeds (CMB), lacunar infarctions (LI), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Multivariable-adjusted regression models, linear mixed-effects models, and the Spearman correlations were used to evaluate the associations. At baseline, individuals with greater neutrophils (odds ratio [OR] =1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.20, p=0.042) and monocytes (OR=1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22, p=0.016) had higher WMH volume. On the contrary, a higher lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) was related to lower WMH volume (OR=0.91, 95% CI 0.82-1.00, p=0.041). Longitudinally, higher neutrophils (ρ=0.084, p=0.049) and NLR (ρ=0.111, p=0.009) predicted accelerated progression of WMH volume, while a greater LMR (ρ=-0.101, p=0.018) was linked to slower growth of WMH volume. Nevertheless, associations between peripheral immunity with CMB or LI were not observed at baseline and follow-up. Our study found that peripheral immune indexes could serve as convenient noninvasive biomarkers of WMH.",2024,Cerebral small vessel disease; Inflammation; Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio; Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; Peripheral immunity,Humans; Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Dementia; White Matter,"Xiao, CY; Ma, YH; Zhao, YL; Liu, JY; Tan, L"

Functional Selection of Tau Oligomerization-Inhibiting Aptamers.,"Pathological hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of microtubule-associated Tau protein contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other related tauopathies. Currently, no cure exists for Alzheimer's Disease. Aptamers offer significant potential as next-generation therapeutics in biotechnology and the treatment of neurological disorders. Traditional aptamer selection methods for Tau protein focus on binding affinity rather than interference with pathological Tau. In this study, we developed a new selection strategy to enrich DNA aptamers that bind to surviving monomeric Tau protein under conditions that would typically promote Tau aggregation. Employing this approach, we identified a set of aptamer candidates.

Beyond CSF and Neuroimaging Assessment: Evaluating Plasma miR-145-5p as a Potential Biomarker for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. New strategies for the early detection of MCI and sporadic AD are crucial for developing effective treatment options. Current techniques used for diagnosis of AD are invasive and/or expensive, so they are not suitable for population screening. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers such as amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) levels are core biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. Several studies have proposed the use of blood-circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential novel early biomarkers for AD. We therefore applied a novel approach to identify blood-circulating miRNAs associated with CSF biomarkers and explored the potential of these miRNAs as biomarkers of AD. In total, 112 subjects consisting of 28 dementia due to AD cases, 63 MCI due to AD cases, and 21 cognitively healthy controls were included. We identified seven Aβ1-42-associated plasma miRNAs, six P-tau181-associated plasma miRNAs, and nine Aβ1-42-associated serum miRNAs. These miRNAs were involved in AD-relevant biological processes, such as PI3K/AKT signaling. Based on this signaling pathway, we constructed an miRNA-gene target network, wherein miR-145-5p has been identified as a hub. Furthermore, we showed that miR-145-5p performs best in the prediction of both AD and MCI. Moreover, miR-145-5p also improved the prediction performance of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. The performance of this miRNA was validated using different datasets including an RT-qPCR dataset from plasma samples of 23 MCI cases and 30 age-matched controls. These findings indicate that blood-circulating miRNAs that are associated with CSF biomarkers levels and specifically plasma miR-145-5p alone or combined with the MMSE score can potentially be used as noninvasive biomarkers for AD or MCI screening in the general population, although studies in other AD cohorts are necessary for further validation.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; PI3K/AKT signaling; biomarkers; miR-145; microRNAs,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Cognitive Dysfunction; MicroRNAs; Biomarkers; Neuroimaging; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Wen, Q; Wittens, MMJ; Engelborghs, S; van Herwijnen, MHM; Tsamou, M; Roggen, E; Smeets, B; Krauskopf, J; Briedé, JJ"
Serum amyloid beta 42 levels correlated with metabolic syndrome and its components.,"Beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain appears to be a key initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and factors associated with increased deposition of beta-amyloid are of great interest. Enhanced deposition of amyloid-β peptides is due to an imbalance between their production and elimination. Previous studies show that diminished levels of CSF amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) is a biomarker in AD; however, the role of serum Aβ42 in AD is contradictory. BMI and obesity have been reported to be related to increased serum Aβ42 levels. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relation between metabolic syndrome (MetS), its clinical measures (abdominal obesity, high glucose, high triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and hypertension), and serum Aβ42 levels.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); blood lipids; blood pressure; body mass index (BMI); metabolic syndrome; serum amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42),"Humans; Aged, 80 and over; Metabolic Syndrome; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Obesity; Alzheimer Disease; Triglycerides; Lipoproteins, HDL; Biomarkers; Glucose","Li, K; Zhou, X; Liu, Y; Li, D; Li, Y; Zhang, T; Fu, C; Li, L; Hu, Y; Jiang, L"

PANoptosis involves the simultaneous activation of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis within the same population of cells. However, its specific role in the context of seizures remains to be fully elucidated.

TNF-α Levels Are Increased in Patients with Subjective Cognitive Impairment and Are Negatively Correlated with β Amyloid-42.,"The role of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently become a topic of debate. TNF-α levels increase in the blood of patients with AD, and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques contain TNF-α deposits. The therapeutic efficacy of blocking TNF-α in patients with AD remains controversial as it is mostly based on preclinical studies. Thus, whether and how TNF-α contributes to amyloidogenic processes in AD is still an open question to be addressed. We analyzed plasma TNF-α and Aβ42 levels in patients with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, and in healthy volunteers (HLT). In addition, we performed correlation analysis to evaluate whether changes in plasma TNF-α levels correlate with cognitive decline, Aβ42 levels, age, and BMI, which are all factors considered to contribute to or predispose individuals to AD. We found that TNF-α and Aβ42 plasma levels were higher in patients with AD than in HLT individuals. High TNF-α levels were also observed in patients with SCI, in whom TNF-α and Aβ42 levels were negatively correlated. Notably, TNF-α did not affect the amyloidogenic pathway in human microglial cultures exposed to 48 h of incubation, although it did trigger neuroinflammatory processes. These results imply that high TNF-α levels are more likely to be a clinical condition linked to AD than are direct contributors. Nonetheless, elevated levels of TNF-α in early-stage patients, like those with SCI and MCI, may provide a distinguishing feature for identifying clinical profiles that are at risk of having a poorer outcome in AD and could benefit from tailored therapies.",2024,APP Tyr682 phosphorylation; Alzheimer’s disease; Fyn; TNF-α; amyloid beta; biomarkers; mild cognitive impairment; neurodegeneration; neuroinflammation; subjective cognitive impairment,,"Serafini, S; Ferretti, G; Monterosso, P; Angiolillo, A; Di Costanzo, A; Matrone, C"

Freestanding Nanofiber-Assembled Aptasensor for Precisely and Ultrafast Electrochemical Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers.,"Amyloid beta-protein (AβAβ) is a main hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a low amount of Aβ protein accumulation appears to be a potential marker for AD. Here, an electrochemical DNA biosensor based on polyamide/polyaniline carbon nanotubes (PA/PANI-CNTs) is developed with the aim of diagnosing AD early using a simple, low-cost, and accessible method to rapidly detect Aβ42 in human blood. Electrospun PA nanofibers served as the skeleton for the successive in situ deposition of PANI and CNTs, which contribute both high conductivity and abundant binding sites for the Aβ42 aptamers. After the aptamers are immobilized, this aptasensor exhibits precise and specific detection of Aβ42 in human blood within only 4 min with an extremely fast response rate, lower detection limit, and excellent linear detection range.

Highly accurate blood test for Alzheimer's disease is similar or superior to clinical cerebrospinal fluid tests.,"With the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying therapies, identifying patients who could benefit from these treatments becomes critical. In this study, we evaluated whether a precise blood test could perform as well as established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Plasma %p-tau217 (ratio of phosporylated-tau217 to non-phosphorylated tau) was analyzed by mass spectrometry in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n = 1,422) and the US Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) cohort (n = 337). Matched CSF samples were analyzed with clinically used and FDA-approved automated immunoassays for Aβ42/40 and p-tau181/Aβ42. The primary and secondary outcomes were detection of brain Aβ or tau pathology, respectively, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the reference standard. Main analyses were focused on individuals with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia), which is the target population for available disease-modifying treatments. Plasma %p-tau217 was clinically equivalent to FDA-approved CSF tests in classifying Aβ PET status, with an area under the curve (AUC) for both between 0.95 and 0.97. Plasma %p-tau217 was generally superior to CSF tests in classification of tau-PET with AUCs of 0.95-0.98. In cognitively impaired subcohorts (BioFINDER-2: n = 720; Knight ADRC: n = 50), plasma %p-tau217 had an accuracy, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 89-90% for Aβ PET and 87-88% for tau PET status, which was clinically equivalent to CSF tests, further improving to 95% using a two-cutoffs approach. Blood plasma %p-tau217 demonstrated performance that was clinically equivalent or superior to clinically used FDA-approved CSF tests in the detection of AD pathology.

"Validation, Deployment, and Real-World Implementation of a Modular Toolbox for Alzheimer's Disease Detection and Dementia Risk Reduction: The AD-RIDDLE Project.","The Real-World Implementation, Deployment, and Validation of Early Detection Tools and Lifestyle Enhancement (AD-RIDDLE) project, recently launched with the support of the EU Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) public-private partnership and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), aims to develop, test, and deploy a modular toolbox platform that can reduce existing barriers to the timely detection, and therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus accelerating AD innovation. By focusing on health system and health worker practices, AD-RIDDLE seeks to improve and smooth AD management at and between each key step of the clinical pathway and across the disease continuum, from at-risk asymptomatic stages to early symptomatic ones. This includes innovation and improvement in AD awareness, risk reduction and prevention, detection, diagnosis, and intervention.

Present and Future of Blood-Based Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease: Beyond the Classics.,"The field of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has advanced at an incredible pace, especially after the development of sensitive analytic platforms that can facilitate large-scale screening. Such screening will be important when more sophisticated diagnostic methods are scarce and expensive. Thus, blood-based biomarkers can potentially reduce diagnosis inequities among populations from different socioeconomic contexts. This large-scale screening can be performed so that older adults at risk of cognitive decline assessed using these methods can then undergo more complete assessments with classic biomarkers, increasing diagnosis efficiency and reducing costs to the health systems. Blood-based biomarkers can also aid in assessing the effect of new disease-modifying treatments. This paper reviews recent advances in the area, focusing on the following leading candidates for blood-based biomarkers: amyloid-beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau isoforms (p-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic (GFAP) proteins, as well as on new candidates, Neuron-Derived Exosomes contents (NDEs) and Transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), based on data from longitudinal observational cohort studies. The underlying challenges of validating and incorporating these biomarkers into routine clinical practice and primary care settings are also discussed. Importantly, challenges related to the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged persons must be considered. If these challenges are overcome, a new time of cost-effective blood-based biomarkers for AD could represent the future of clinical procedures in the field and, together with continued prevention strategies, the beginning of an era with a lower incidence of dementia worldwide.",2024,Alzheimer disease; Biomarker; Blood; Cognition; Dementia; Plasma,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Biomarkers; tau Proteins,"Mantellatto Grigoli, M; Pelegrini, LNC; Whelan, R; Cominetti, MR"

Surface-functionalized SERS platform for deep learning-assisted diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to stall the deterioration of brain function, but conventional diagnostic methods require complicated analytical procedures or inflict acute pain on the patient. Then, label-free Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis of blood-based biomarkers is a convenient alternative to rapidly obtain spectral information from biofluids. However, despite the rapid acquisition of spectral information from biofluids, it is challenging to distinguish spectral features of biomarkers due to interference from biofluidic components. Here, we introduce a deep learning-assisted, SERS-based platform for separate analysis of blood-based amyloid β (1-42) and metabolites, enabling the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. SERS substrates consisting of Au nanowire arrays are fabricated and functionalized in two characteristic ways to compare the validity of different Alzheimer's disease biomarkers measured on our SERS system. The 6E10 antibody is immobilized for the capture of amyloid β (1-42) and analysis of its oligomerization process, while various self-assembled monolayers are attached for different dipole interactions with blood-based metabolites. Ultimately, SERS spectra of blood plasma of Alzheimer's disease patients and human controls are measured on the substrates and classified via advanced deep learning techniques that automatically extract informative features to learn generalizable representations. Accuracies up to 99.5% are achieved for metabolite-based analyses, which are verified with an explainable artificial intelligence technique that identifies key spectral features used for classification and for deducing significant biomarkers.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Blood-based biomarker; Deep learning; Gold nanowire array; Label-free diagnosis; Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Biosensing Techniques; Metal Nanoparticles; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Biomarkers","Kim, M; Huh, S; Park, HJ; Cho, SH; Lee, MY; Jo, S; Jung, YS"

European intersocietal recommendations for the biomarker-based diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders.,"The recent commercialisation of the first disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease emphasises the need for consensus recommendations on the rational use of biomarkers to diagnose people with suspected neurocognitive disorders in memory clinics. Most available recommendations and guidelines are either disease-centred or biomarker-centred. A European multidisciplinary taskforce consisting of 22 experts from 11 European scientific societies set out to define the first patient-centred diagnostic workflow that aims to prioritise testing for available biomarkers in individuals attending memory clinics. After an extensive literature review, we used a Delphi consensus procedure to identify 11 clinical syndromes, based on clinical history and examination, neuropsychology, blood tests, structural imaging, and, in some cases, EEG. We recommend first-line and, if needed, second-line testing for biomarkers according to the patient's clinical profile and the results of previous biomarker findings.

Cognitively healthy APOE4/4 carriers show white matter impairment associated with serum NfL and amyloid-PET.,"Except for aging, carrying the APOE ε4 allele (APOE4) is the most important risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. APOE4 carriers may have reduced capacity to recycle lipids, resulting in white matter microstructural abnormalities. In this study, we evaluated whether white matter impairment measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) differs between healthy individuals with a different number of APOE4 alleles, and whether white matter impairment associates with brain beta-amyloid (Aβ) load and serum levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL). We studied 96 participants (APOE3/3, N = 37; APOE3/4, N = 39; APOE4/4, N = 20; mean age 70.7 (SD 5.22) years, 63% females) with a brain MRI including a DTI sequence (N = 96), Aβ-PET (N = 89) and a venous blood sample for the serum NfL concentration measurement (N = 88). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AxD) in six a priori-selected white matter regions-of-interest (ROIs) were compared between the groups using ANCOVA, with sex and age as covariates. A voxel-weighted average of FA, MD, RD and AxD was calculated for each subject, and correlations with Aβ-PET and NfL levels were evaluated. APOE4/4 carriers exhibited a higher MD and a higher RD in the body of corpus callosum than APOE3/4 (p = 0.0053 and p = 0.0049, respectively) and APOE3/3 (p = 0.026 and p = 0.042). APOE4/4 carriers had a higher AxD than APOE3/4 (p = 0.012) and APOE3/3 (p = 0.040) in the right cingulum adjacent to cingulate cortex. In the total sample, composite MD, RD and AxD positively correlated with the cortical Aβ load (r = 0.26 to 0.33, p < 0.013 for all) and with serum NfL concentrations (r = 0.31 to 0.36, p < 0.0028 for all). In conclusion, increased local diffusivity was detected in cognitively unimpaired APOE4/4 homozygotes compared to APOE3/4 and APOE3/3 carriers, and increased diffusivity correlated with biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration. White matter impairment seems to be an early phenomenon in the Alzheimer's disease pathologic process in APOE4/4 homozygotes.",2024,APOE; Alzheimer's disease; Apolipoprotein E; DTI; Diffusion tensor imaging; MRI; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurofilament light chain; Positron emission tomography; [(11)C]PiB,Female; Humans; Aged; Male; White Matter; Apolipoprotein E4; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E3; Brain,"Tato-Fernández, C; Ekblad, LL; Pietilä, E; Saunavaara, V; Helin, S; Parkkola, R; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Rinne, JO; Snellman, A"

"Emergence of Extracellular Vesicles as ""Liquid Biopsy"" for Neurological Disorders: Boom or Bust.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as an attractive liquid biopsy approach in the diagnosis and prognosis of multiple diseases and disorders. The feasibility of enriching specific subpopulations of EVs from biofluids based on their unique surface markers has opened novel opportunities to gain molecular insight from various tissues and organs, including the brain. Over the past decade, EVs in bodily fluids have been extensively studied for biomarkers associated with various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorders, substance use disorders, human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurocognitive disorder, and cancer/treatment-induced neurodegeneration. These studies have focused on the isolation and cargo characterization of either total EVs or brain cells, such as neuron-, astrocyte-, microglia-, oligodendrocyte-, pericyte-, and endothelial-derived EVs from biofluids to achieve early diagnosis and molecular characterization and to predict the treatment and intervention outcomes. The findings of these studies have demonstrated that EVs could serve as a repetitive and less invasive source of valuable molecular information for these neurological disorders, supplementing existing costly neuroimaging techniques and relatively invasive measures, like lumbar puncture. However, the initial excitement surrounding blood-based biomarkers for brain-related diseases has been tempered by challenges, such as lack of central nervous system specificity in EV markers, lengthy protocols, and the absence of standardized procedures for biological sample collection, EV isolation, and characterization. Nevertheless, with rapid advancements in the EV field, supported by improved isolation methods and sensitive assays for cargo characterization, brain cell-derived EVs continue to offer unparallel opportunities with significant translational implications for various neurological disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Extracellular vesicles present a less invasive liquid biopsy approach in the diagnosis and prognosis of various neurological disorders. Characterizing these vesicles in biofluids holds the potential to yield valuable molecular information, thereby significantly impacting the development of novel biomarkers for various neurological disorders. This paper has reviewed the methodology employed to isolate extracellular vesicles derived from various brain cells in biofluids, their utility in enhancing the molecular understanding of neurodegeneration, and the potential challenges in this research field.",2024,,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Extracellular Vesicles; Liquid Biopsy; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease","Kumar, A; Nader, MA; Deep, G"

Fluid biomarkers in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a type of cerebrovascular disorder characterised by the accumulation of amyloid within the leptomeninges and small/medium-sized cerebral blood vessels. Typically, cerebral haemorrhages are one of the first clinical manifestations of CAA, posing a considerable challenge to the timely diagnosis of CAA as the bleedings only occur during the later disease stages. Fluid biomarkers may change prior to imaging biomarkers, and therefore, they could be the future of CAA diagnosis. Additionally, they can be used as primary outcome markers in prospective clinical trials. Among fluid biomarkers, blood-based biomarkers offer a distinct advantage over cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers as they do not require a procedure as invasive as a lumbar puncture. This article aimed to provide an overview of the present clinical data concerning fluid biomarkers associated with CAA and point out the direction of future studies. Among all the biomarkers discussed, amyloid β, neurofilament light chain, matrix metalloproteinases, complement 3, uric acid, and lactadherin demonstrated the most promising evidence. However, the field of fluid biomarkers for CAA is an under-researched area, and in most cases, there are only one or two studies on each of the biomarkers mentioned in this review. Additionally, a small sample size is a common limitation of the discussed studies. Hence, it is hard to reach a solid conclusion on the clinical significance of each biomarker at different stages of the disease or in various subpopulations of CAA. In order to overcome this issue, larger longitudinal and multicentered studies are needed.",2024,amyloid beta; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; differential diagnosis; familial cerebral amyloid angiopathy; fluid biomarkers; surrogate endpoints,,"Savar, SM; Ma, B; Hone, E; Jahan, F; Markovic, S; Pedrini, S; Shemehsavar, S; Easwaran, V; Taddei, K; Gardener, S; Chhatwal, JP; van Etten, ES; van Osch, MJP; Clarke, D; Gnjec, A; van Buchem, MA; Wermer, MJH; Hankey, GJ; Greenberg, SM; Martins, RN; Sohrabi, HR"

To comprehensively understand changes in circRNAs we performed a cross-sectional study utilizing the last visit of each participant, and a longitudinal (mix model) analysis that included 1,166 participants with at least two time points. We identified 192 circRNAs differentially expressed in PD participants compared to healthy controls, with effects that were consistent in the mixed models, mutation carriers, and diverse ancestry.

Longitudinal progression of blood biomarkers reveals a key role of astrocyte reactivity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Defining the progression of blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for targeting treatments in patients most likely to benefit from early intervention. We delineated the temporal ordering of blood biomarkers a decade prior to the onset of AD symptoms in participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We show that increased astrocyte reactivity, assessed by elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels is an early event in the progression of blood biomarker changes in preclinical AD. In AD-converters who are initially cognitively unimpaired (N=158, 377 serial plasma samples), higher plasma GFAP levels are observed as early as 10-years prior to the onset of cognitive impairment due to incident AD compared to individuals who remain cognitively unimpaired (CU, N=160, 379 serial plasma samples). Plasma GFAP levels in AD-converters remain elevated 5-years prior to and coincident with the onset of cognitive impairment due to AD. In participants with neuropathologically confirmed AD, plasma GFAP levels are elevated relative to cognitively normal individuals and intermediate in those who remain cognitively unimpaired despite significant AD pathology (asymptomatic AD). Higher plasma GFAP levels at death are associated with greater severity of both neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In the 5XFAD transgenic model of AD, we observed greater GFAP levels in the cortex and hippocampus of transgenic mice relative to wild-type prior to the development of cognitive impairment. Reactive astrocytosis, an established biological response to neuronal injury, may be an early initiator of AD pathogenesis and a promising therapeutic target.",2024,,,"Varma, VR; An, Y; Kac, PR; Bilgel, M; Moghekar, A; Loeffler, T; Amschl, D; Troncoso, J; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Ashton, NJ; Resnick, SM; Thambisetty, M"

Phosphoproteome Microarray Analysis of Extracellular Particles as a Tool to Explore Novel Biomarker Candidates for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Phosphorylation plays a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, impacting distinct processes such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide production and tau phosphorylation. Impaired phosphorylation events contribute to senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles' formation, two major histopathological hallmarks of AD. Blood-derived extracellular particles (bdEP) can represent a disease-related source of phosphobiomarker candidates, and hence, in this pilot study, bdEP of Control and AD cases were analyzed by a targeted phosphoproteomics approach using a high-density microarray that featured at least 1145 pan-specific and 913 phosphosite-specific antibodies. This approach, innovatively applied to bdEP, allowed the identification of 150 proteins whose expression levels and/or phosphorylation patterns were significantly altered across AD cases. Gene Ontology enrichment and Reactome pathway analysis unraveled potentially relevant molecular targets and disease-associated pathways, and protein-protein interaction networks were constructed to highlight key targets. The discriminatory value of both the total proteome and the phosphoproteome was evaluated by univariate and multivariate approaches. This pilot experiment supports that bdEP are enriched in phosphotargets relevant in an AD context, holding value as peripheral biomarker candidates for disease diagnosis.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; extracellular vesicles; phosphoproteome,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Proteome; Pilot Projects; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Neurofibrillary Tangles,"Soares Martins, T; Pelech, S; Ferreira, M; Pinho, B; Leandro, K; de Almeida, LP; Breitling, B; Hansen, N; Esselmann, H; Wiltfang, J; da Cruz E Silva, OAB; Henriques, AG"
Association of Plasma Claudin-5 with Age and Alzheimer Disease.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays pivotal roles in synaptic and neuronal functioning by sealing the space between adjacent microvascular endothelial cells. BBB breakdown is present in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer disease (AD). Claudin-5 (CLDN-5) is a tetra-spanning protein essential for sealing the intercellular space between adjacent endothelial cells in the BBB. In this study, we developed a blood-based assay for CLDN-5 and investigated its diagnostic utility using 100 cognitively normal (control) subjects, 100 patients with MCI, and 100 patients with AD. Plasma CLDN-5 levels were increased in patients with AD (3.08 ng/mL) compared with controls (2.77 ng/mL). Plasma levels of phosphorylated tau (pTau181), a biomarker of pathological tau, were elevated in patients with MCI or AD (2.86 and 4.20 pg/mL, respectively) compared with control subjects (1.81 pg/mL). In patients with MCI or AD, plasma levels of CLDN-5-but not pTau181-decreased with age, suggesting some age-dependent BBB changes in MCI and AD. These findings suggest that plasma CLDN-5 may a potential biochemical marker for the diagnosis of AD.",2024,Alzheimer disease; biomarker; blood–brain barrier; claudin-5; dementia; tight junction,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Blood-Brain Barrier; Claudin-5; Cognitive Dysfunction; Endothelial Cells; tau Proteins,"Tachibana, K; Hirayama, R; Sato, N; Hattori, K; Kato, T; Takeda, H; Kondoh, M"

Pulse pressure and APOE ε4 dose interact to affect cerebral blood flow in older adults without dementia.,"This study assessed whether the effect of vascular risk on cerebral blood flow (CBF) varies by gene dose of apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 alleles. 144 older adults without dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent arterial spin labeling and T1-weighted MRI, APOE genotyping, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), lumbar puncture, and blood pressure (BP) assessment. Vascular risk was assessed using pulse pressure (systolic BP - diastolic BP). CBF was examined in six AD-vulnerable regions: entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, inferior temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, rostral middle frontal gyrus, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Linear regressions tested the interaction between APOE ε4 dose and pulse pressure on CBF in each region, adjusting for age, sex, cognitive classification, antihypertensive medication use, FDG-PET, reference CBF region, and AD biomarker positivity. There was a significant interaction between pulse pressure and APOE ɛ4 dose on CBF in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and inferior parietal cortex, such that higher pulse pressure was associated with lower CBF only among ε4 homozygous participants. These findings demonstrate that the association between pulse pressure and regional CBF differs by APOE ε4 dose, suggesting that targeting modifiable vascular risk factors may be particularly important for those genetically at risk for AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Apolipoprotein E; Arterial spin labeling; Cerebral blood flow; Pulse pressure,,"Edwards, L; Thomas, KR; Weigand, AJ; Edmonds, EC; Clark, AL; Brenner, EK; Banks, SJ; Gilbert, PE; Nation, DA; Delano-Wood, L; Bondi, MW; Bangen, KJ"

"Association between Alzheimer's disease, ","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease and there is still no definitive treatment today. Early diagnosis of the disease is important, but there are almost no biomarkers that can be used in early diagnosis. The cerebrospinal fluid used in the diagnosis of the disease is not sufficient and is very difficult to obtain. Therefore, blood biomarkers that are less costly, less invasive, easily accessible, and can be used in long-term studies would be a better alternative. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between Alzheimer's Disease and P301L MAPT gene mutation, homocysteine, folate and uric acid. 101 Alzheimer's patients and 101 healthy individuals were included in this study. Mutation analysis was performed using the Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method with blood samples taken from the subjects.

Assessment of immunoprecipitation with subsequent immunoassays for the blood-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"The Aβ42/40 ratio and the concentration of phosphorylated Tau181 in blood plasma represent attractive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. As a means for reducing potential matrix effects, which may interfere with plasma immunoassays, we have previously developed a pre-analytical sample workup by semi-automated immunoprecipitation. Here we test the compatibility of pre-analytical immunoprecipitations with automated Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and phosphorylated Tau181 immunoassays on the Lumipulse platform and compare the diagnostic performance of the respective immunoprecipitation immunoassay approaches with direct plasma measurements. 71 participants were dichotomized according to their Aβ42/40 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid into the diagnostic groups amyloid-positive (n = 32) and amyloid-negative (n = 39). The plasma Aβ1-42/1-40 ratio and phosphorylated Tau181 levels were determined on the Lumipulse G600II platform (Fujirebio) by direct measurements in EDTA-plasma or after Aβ- or Tau-immunoprecipitation, respectively. Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation of Aβ turned out to be compatible with the Lumipulse Aβ assays and resulted in a numerical, yet statistically not significant increase in the area under the ROC curve for plasma Aβ1-42/1-40. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the standardised effect size (Cohen's D). Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation of Tau resulted in increased differences between the diagnostic groups in terms of median and mean phosphorylated Tau 181 levels. Furthermore, we observed a greater Cohen's d (p < 0.001) and a larger area under the ROC curve (p = 0.038) after Tau-IP. Our preliminary findings in a small, preselected sample indicate that pre-analytical immunoprecipitation may have the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarker immunoassays for Aβ1-42/1-40 and phosphorylated Tau181 to predict brain amyloid deposition.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta; Biomarker; Blood plasma; Tau,,"Morgado, B; Klafki, HW; Bauer, C; Waniek, K; Esselmann, H; Wirths, O; Hansen, N; Lachmann, I; Osterloh, D; Schuchhardt, J; Wiltfang, J"

Plasma VEGFA and PGF impact longitudinal tau and cognition in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Vascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways have been implicated as potential mechanisms. However, the specific impact of VEGF proteins in preclinical Alzheimer's disease and their relationships with other Alzheimer's disease and vascular pathologies during this critical early period remain to be elucidated. We included 317 older adults from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a cohort of individuals who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline and followed longitudinally for up to 12 years. Baseline VEGF family protein levels (VEGFA, VEGFC, VEGFD, PGF and FLT1) were measured in fasting plasma using high-sensitivity immunoassays. Using linear mixed effects models, we examined the interactive effects of baseline plasma VEGF proteins and amyloid PET burden (Pittsburgh Compound-B) on longitudinal cognition (Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite-5). We further investigated if effects on cognition were mediated by early neocortical tau accumulation (flortaucipir PET burden in the inferior temporal cortex) or hippocampal atrophy. Lastly, we examined the impact of adjusting for baseline cardiovascular risk score or white matter hyperintensity volume. Baseline plasma VEGFA and PGF each showed a significant interaction with amyloid burden on prospective cognitive decline. Specifically, low VEGFA and high PGF were associated with greater cognitive decline in individuals with elevated amyloid, i.e. those on the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Concordantly, low VEGFA and high PGF were associated with accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation in those with elevated amyloid. Moderated mediation analyses confirmed that accelerated tau accumulation fully mediated the effects of low VEGFA and partially mediated (31%) the effects of high PGF on faster amyloid-related cognitive decline. The effects of VEGFA and PGF on tau and cognition remained significant after adjusting for cardiovascular risk score or white matter hyperintensity volume. There were concordant but non-significant associations with longitudinal hippocampal atrophy. Together, our findings implicate low VEGFA and high PGF in accelerating early neocortical tau pathology and cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, our results underscore the potential of these minimally-invasive plasma biomarkers to inform the risk of Alzheimer's disease progression in the preclinical population. Importantly, VEGFA and PGF appear to capture distinct effects from vascular risks and cerebrovascular injury. This highlights their potential as new therapeutic targets, in combination with anti-amyloid and traditional vascular risk reduction therapies, to slow the trajectory of preclinical Alzheimer's disease and delay or prevent the onset of cognitive decline.",2024,VCID; angiogenesis; biomarker; dementia,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Female; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Aged; tau Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Positron-Emission Tomography; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers","Yang, HS; Yau, WW; Carlyle, BC; Trombetta, BA; Zhang, C; Shirzadi, Z; Schultz, AP; Pruzin, JJ; Fitzpatrick, CD; Kirn, DR; Rabin, JS; Buckley, RF; Hohman, TJ; Rentz, DM; Tanzi, RE; Johnson, KA; Sperling, RA; Arnold, SE; Chhatwal, JP"
Investigating metabolic dysregulation in serum of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice: implications for pathogenesis and potential biomarkers.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that lacks convenient and accessible peripheral blood diagnostic markers and effective drugs. Metabolic dysfunction is one of AD risk factors, which leaded to alterations of various metabolites in the body. Pathological changes of the brain can be reflected in blood metabolites that are expected to explain the disease mechanisms or be candidate biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of targeted metabolites within peripheral blood of AD mouse model, with the purpose of exploring the disease mechanism and potential biomarkers. Targeted metabolomics was used to quantify 256 metabolites in serum of triple transgenic AD (3 × Tg-AD) male mice. Compared with controls, 49 differential metabolites represented dysregulation in purine, pyrimidine, tryptophan, cysteine and methionine and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Among them, adenosine, serotonin, N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, and acetylcholine play a key role in regulating neural transmitter network. The alteration of S-adenosine-L-homocysteine, S-adenosine-L-methionine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide in AD mice serum can served as indicator of AD risk. The results revealed the changes of metabolites in serum, suggesting that metabolic dysregulation in periphery in AD mice may be related to the disturbances in neuroinhibition, the serotonergic system, sleep function, the cholinergic system, and the gut microbiota. This study provides novel insights into the dysregulation of several key metabolites and metabolic pathways in AD, presenting potential avenues for future research and the development of peripheral biomarkers.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarker; Serum; Target metabolomics; Triple-transgenic AD mice,"Animals; Male; Mice; Adenosine; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Metabolomics; Mice, Transgenic; Neurodegenerative Diseases; S-Adenosylhomocysteine","Zhuang, H; Cao, X; Tang, X; Zou, Y; Yang, H; Liang, Z; Yan, X; Chen, X; Feng, X; Shen, L"
Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.,"Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic 'bioenergetic capacity' as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.",2024,,,"Arnold, M; Buyukozkan, M; Doraiswamy, PM; Nho, K; Wu, T; Gudnason, V; Launer, LJ; Wang-Sattler, R; Adamski, J; De Jager, PL; Ertekin-Taner, N; Bennett, DA; Saykin, AJ; Peters, A; Suhre, K; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Kastenmüller, G; Krumsiek, J"

Using Neuroimaging to Study Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Its Relationship to Alzheimer's Disease.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by amyloid-β aggregation in the media and adventitia of the leptomeningeal and cortical blood vessels. CAA is one of the strongest vascular contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD). It frequently co-occurs in AD patients, but the relationship between CAA and AD is incompletely understood. CAA may drive AD risk through damage to the neurovascular unit and accelerate parenchymal amyloid and tau deposition. Conversely, early AD may also drive CAA through cerebrovascular remodeling that impairs blood vessels from clearing amyloid-β. Sole reliance on autopsy examination to study CAA limits researchers' ability to investigate CAA's natural disease course and the effect of CAA on cognitive decline. Neuroimaging allows for in vivo assessment of brain function and structure and can be leveraged to investigate CAA staging and explore its associations with AD. In this review, we will discuss neuroimaging modalities that can be used to investigate markers associated with CAA that may impact AD vulnerability including hemorrhages and microbleeds, blood-brain barrier permeability disruption, reduced cerebral blood flow, amyloid and tau accumulation, white matter tract disruption, reduced cerebrovascular reactivity, and lowered brain glucose metabolism.

Amyloid deposition and small vessel disease are associated with cognitive function in older adults with type 2 diabetes.,"Diabetes is associated with cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are complex and their relationship with Alzheimer's Disease biomarkers is not fully understood. We assessed the association of small vessel disease (SVD) and amyloid burden with cognitive functioning in 47 non-demented older adults with type-2 diabetes from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study (mean age 78Y, 64% females). FLAIR-MRI, Vizamyl amyloid-PET, and T1W-MRI quantified white matter hyperintensities as a measure of SVD, amyloid burden, and gray matter (GM) volume, respectively. Mean hemoglobin A1c levels and duration of type-2 diabetes were used as measures of diabetic control. Cholesterol level and blood pressure were used as measures of cardiovascular risk. A broad neuropsychological battery assessed cognition. Linear regression models revealed that both higher SVD and amyloid burden were associated with lower cognitive functioning. Additional adjustments for type-2 diabetes-related characteristics, GM volume, and cardiovascular risk did not alter the results. The association of amyloid with cognition remained unchanged after further adjustment for SVD, and the association of SVD with cognition remained unchanged after further adjustment for amyloid burden. Our findings suggest that SVD and amyloid pathology may independently contribute to lower cognitive functioning in non-demented older adults with type-2 diabetes, supporting a multimodal approach for diagnosing, preventing, and treating cognitive decline in this population.",2024,,"Female; Humans; Aged; Male; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Cognition; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition Disorders; Amyloid; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Vascular Diseases; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Brain","Lesman-Segev, OH; Golan Shekhtman, S; Springer, RR; Livny, A; Lin, HM; Yuxia, O; Zadok, M; Ganmore, I; Heymann, A; Hoffmann, C; Domachevsky, L; Schnaider Beeri, M"

We also tested four additional epigenetic measures of aging: the Horvath clock, the Hannum clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Across all datasets (total N observations=3380; total N individuals=2322), faster DunedinPACE was associated with lower total brain volume, lower hippocampal volume, greater burden of white matter microlesions, and thinner cortex.

Application of blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice: Recommendations from Taiwan Dementia Society.,"Blood-based biomarkers (BBM) are potentially powerful tools that assist in the biological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo with minimal invasiveness, relatively low cost, and good accessibility. This review summarizes current evidence for using BBMs in AD, focusing on amyloid, tau, and biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Blood-based phosphorylated tau and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio showed consistent concordance with brain pathology measured by CSF or PET in the research setting. In addition, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are neurodegenerative biomarkers that show the potential to assist in the differential diagnosis of AD. Other pathology-specific biomarkers, such as α-synuclein and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), can potentially detect AD concurrent pathology. Based on current evidence, the working group from the Taiwan Dementia Society (TDS) achieved consensus recommendations on the appropriate use of BBMs for AD in clinical practice. BBMs may assist clinical diagnosis and prognosis in AD subjects with cognitive symptoms; however, the results should be interpreted by dementia specialists and combining biochemical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging information. Further studies are needed to evaluate BBMs' real-world performance and potential impact on clinical decision-making.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Blood-based biomarkers; Diagnosis; Prognosis,,"Cheng, YW; Lin, YJ; Lin, YS; Hong, WP; Kuan, YC; Wu, KY; Hsu, JL; Wang, PN; Pai, MC; Chen, CS; Fuh, JL; Hu, CJ; Chiu, MJ"

Iatrogenic Alzheimer's disease in recipients of cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in brain parenchyma and blood vessels (as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)) and by neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. Compelling genetic and biomarker evidence supports Aβ as the root cause of AD. We previously reported human transmission of Aβ pathology and CAA in relatively young adults who had died of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD) after childhood treatment with cadaver-derived pituitary growth hormone (c-hGH) contaminated with both CJD prions and Aβ seeds. This raised the possibility that c-hGH recipients who did not die from iCJD may eventually develop AD. Here we describe recipients who developed dementia and biomarker changes within the phenotypic spectrum of AD, suggesting that AD, like CJD, has environmentally acquired (iatrogenic) forms as well as late-onset sporadic and early-onset inherited forms. Although iatrogenic AD may be rare, and there is no suggestion that Aβ can be transmitted between individuals in activities of daily life, its recognition emphasizes the need to review measures to prevent accidental transmissions via other medical and surgical procedures. As propagating Aβ assemblies may exhibit structural diversity akin to conventional prions, it is possible that therapeutic strategies targeting disease-related assemblies may lead to selection of minor components and development of resistance.",2024,,Young Adult; Humans; Child; Alzheimer Disease; Growth Hormone; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Brain; Prions; Cadaver; Iatrogenic Disease; Biomarkers,"Banerjee, G; Farmer, SF; Hyare, H; Jaunmuktane, Z; Mead, S; Ryan, NS; Schott, JM; Werring, DJ; Rudge, P; Collinge, J"

Multi-Omic Blood Biomarkers as Dynamic Risk Predictors in Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, accounting for a growing burden of morbidity and mortality. Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease before symptoms are established is clinically challenging, but would provide therapeutic windows for disease-modifying interventions. Blood biomarkers, including genetics, proteins and metabolites, are emerging as powerful predictors of Alzheimer's disease at various timepoints within the disease course, including at the preclinical stage. In this review, we discuss recent advances in such blood biomarkers for determining disease risk. We highlight how leveraging polygenic risk scores, based on genome-wide association studies, can help stratify individuals along their risk profile. We summarize studies analyzing protein biomarkers, as well as report on recent proteomic- and metabolomic-based prediction models. Finally, we discuss how a combination of multi-omic blood biomarkers can potentially be used in memory clinics for diagnosis and to assess the dynamic risk an individual has for developing Alzheimer's disease dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; genomics; metabolomics; proteomics; risk prediction,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Multiomics; Proteomics; Biomarkers,"Bhalala, OG; Watson, R; Yassi, N"

We thus aimed to examine the association between the cognitive status of participants (amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI-AD) vs cognitively normal (CN) older adults) and MBI severity.

Analysis of the longitudinal stability of human plasma miRNAs and implications for disease biomarkers.,"There is great interest in developing clinical biomarker assays that can aid in non-invasive diagnosis and/or monitoring of human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological diseases. Yet little is known about the longitudinal stability of miRNAs in human plasma. Here we assessed the intraindividual longitudinal stability of miRNAs in plasma from healthy human adults, and the impact of common factors (e.g., hemolysis, age) that may confound miRNA data. We collected blood by venipuncture biweekly over a 3-month period from 22 research participants who had fasted overnight, isolated total RNA, then performed miRNA qPCR. Filtering and normalization of the qPCR data revealed amplification of 134 miRNAs, 74 of which had high test-retest reliability and low percentage level drift, meaning they were stable in an individual over the 3-month time period. We also determined that, of nuisance factors, hemolysis and tobacco use have the greatest impact on miRNA levels and variance. These findings support that many miRNAs show intraindividual longitudinal stability in plasma from healthy human adults, including some reported as candidate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.",2024,,Adult; Humans; MicroRNAs; Hemolysis; Reproducibility of Results; Plasma; Biomarkers,"Sandau, US; Wiedrick, JT; McFarland, TJ; Galasko, DR; Fanning, Z; Quinn, JF; Saugstad, JA"

Characterization of Hair Metabolome in 5xFAD Mice and Patients with Alzheimer's Disease Using Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomics.,"Hair emerged as a biospecimen for long-term investigation of endogenous metabolic perturbations, reflecting the chemical composition circulating in the blood over the past months. Despite its potential, the use of human hair for metabolomics in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research remains limited. Here, we performed both untargeted and targeted metabolomic approaches to profile the key metabolic pathways in the hair of 5xFAD mice, a widely used AD mouse model. Furthermore, we applied the discovered metabolites to human subjects. Hair samples were collected from 6-month-old 5xFAD mice, a stage marked by widespread accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, followed by sample preparation and high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis. Forty-five discriminatory metabolites were discovered in the hair of 6-month-old 5xFAD mice compared to wild-type control mice. Enrichment analysis revealed three key metabolic pathways: arachidonic acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Among these pathways, six metabolites demonstrated significant differences in the hair of 2-month-old 5xFAD mice, a stage prior to the onset of amyloid plaque deposition. These findings suggest their potential involvement in the early stages of AD pathogenesis. When evaluating 45 discriminatory metabolites for distinguishing patients with AD from nondemented controls, a combination of l-valine and arachidonic acid significantly differentiated these two groups, achieving a 0.88 area under the curve. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of hair metabolomics in identifying disease-specific metabolic alterations and developing biomarkers for improving disease detection and monitoring.",2024,aachidonic acid metabolism; alanine metabolism; hair; sphingolipid metabolism; untargeted and targeted metabolomics,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Infant; Alzheimer Disease; Arachidonic Acid; Mice, Transgenic; Metabolomics; Metabolome; Mass Spectrometry; Disease Models, Animal","Chang, CW; Hsu, JY; Lo, YT; Liu, YH; Mee-Inta, O; Lee, HT; Kuo, YM; Liao, PC"

Identification of Novel Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Using Unbiased Plasma Proteomics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is a complex disease with multiple pathophysiological drivers that determine clinical symptomology and disease progression. These diseases develop insidiously over time, through many pathways and disease mechanisms and continue to have a huge societal impact for affected individuals and their families. While emerging blood-based biomarkers, such as plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217, accurately detect Alzheimer neuropthology and are associated with faster cognitive decline, the full extension of plasma proteomic changes in ADRD remains unknown. Earlier detection and better classification of the different subtypes may provide opportunities for earlier, more targeted interventions, and perhaps a higher likelihood of successful therapeutic development. In this study, we aim to leverage unbiased mass spectrometry proteomics to identify novel, blood-based biomarkers associated with cognitive decline. 1,786 plasma samples from 1,005 patients were collected over 12 years from partcipants in the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Longitudinal Cohort Study.

Definition of a Threshold for the Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 Ratio Measured by Single-Molecule Array to Predict the Amyloid Status of Individuals without Dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Aβ plaques precede cognitive impairments and can be detected through amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) or in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Assessing the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio seems promising for non-invasive and cost-effective detection of brain Aβ accumulation. This approach involves some challenges, including the accuracy of blood-based biomarker measurements and the establishment of clear, standardized thresholds to categorize the risk of developing brain amyloid pathology.

However, the status of brevican in clinical cohorts with high concomitance of AD pathological burden and cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) is unclear. In this study, 32 non-cognitively impaired (NCI), 97 cognitively impaired no dementia (CIND), 46 AD, and 23 VaD participants recruited from memory clinics based in Singapore underwent neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessments, together with measurements of serum brevican. Association analyses were performed between serum brevican and neuroimaging measures of CeVDs, including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, cortical infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds.

Blood-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease - moving towards a new era of diagnostics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a primary cause of dementia globally, is traditionally diagnosed via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures and positron emission tomography (PET). The invasiveness, cost, and limited accessibility of these methods have led to exploring blood-based biomarkers as a promising alternative for AD diagnosis and monitoring. Recent advancements in sensitive immunoassays have identified potential blood-based biomarkers, such as Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species. This paper briefly evaluates the clinical utility and reliability of these biomarkers across various AD stages, highlighting challenges like refining plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 assays and enhancing the precision of p-tau, particularly p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231. The discussion also covers other plasma biomarkers like neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and synaptic biomarkers, assessing their significance in AD diagnostics. The need for ongoing research and development of robust assays to match the performance of CSF and PET biomarkers is underscored. In summary, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly crucial in AD diagnosis, follow-up, prognostication, treatment response evaluation, and population screening, particularly in primary care settings.

Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: Are Olfactory Neuronal Precursors Useful for ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the main cause of dementia, affects millions of people around the world, whose diagnosis is based mainly on clinical criteria. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is obtained very late, when the neurodegenerative damage is significant for most patients. Therefore, the exhaustive study of biomarkers is indispensable for diagnostic, prognostic, and even follow-up support. AD is a multifactorial disease, and knowing its underlying pathological mechanisms is crucial to propose new and valuable biomarkers. In this review, we summarize some of the main biomarkers described in AD, which have been evaluated mainly by imaging studies in cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples. Furthermore, we describe and propose neuronal precursors derived from the olfactory neuroepithelium as a potential resource to evaluate some of the widely known biomarkers of AD and to gear toward searching for new biomarkers. These neuronal lineage cells, which can be obtained directly from patients through a non-invasive and outpatient procedure, display several characteristics that validate them as a surrogate model to study the central nervous system, allowing the analysis of AD pathophysiological processes. Moreover, the ease of obtaining and harvesting endows them as an accessible and powerful resource to evaluate biomarkers in clinical practice.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; olfactory neuroepithelium; olfactory neuronal precursors,,"Santillán-Morales, V; Rodriguez-Espinosa, N; Muñoz-Estrada, J; Alarcón-Elizalde, S; Acebes, Á; Benítez-King, G"

However, there are many peripheral sources of contamination through which concentrations of these metabolites can be raised or lowered after leaving the brain and entering the central venous pool. This raises the issue of potential false conclusions that could lead to erroneous diagnosis or research findings. We propose the use of simultaneous sampling of internal jugular venous and arterial blood to calculate veno-arterial gradient, which can reveal either a surplus or a deficit of metabolites exiting the brain. Methods for sampling internal jugular venous and arterial blood are described along with examples of the use of the veno-arterial gradient in non-AD brain research. Such methods in turn could help better establish the accuracy of forearm venous biomarkers.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; arterial; biomarkers; radiology; venous,,"Suhocki, PV; Doraiswamy, PM"
Impact of Sleep Disorders and Disturbed Sleep on Brain Health: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,"Accumulating evidence supports a link between sleep disorders, disturbed sleep, and adverse brain health, ranging from stroke to subclinical cerebrovascular disease to cognitive outcomes, including the development of Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease-related dementias. Sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and other sleep disturbances, as well, some of which are also considered sleep disorders (eg, insomnia, sleep fragmentation, circadian rhythm disorders, and extreme sleep duration), have been associated with adverse brain health. Understanding the causal role of sleep disorders and disturbances in the development of adverse brain health is complicated by the common development of sleep disorders among individuals with neurodegenerative disease. In addition to the role of sleep disorders in stroke and cerebrovascular injury, mechanistic hypotheses linking sleep with brain health and biomarker data (blood-based, cerebrospinal fluid-based, and imaging) suggest direct links to Alzheimer disease-specific pathology. These potential mechanisms and the increasing understanding of the ""glymphatic system,"" and the recognition of the importance of sleep in poststroke recovery, as well, support a biological basis for the indirect (through the worsening of vascular disease) and direct (through specific effects on neuropathology) connections between sleep disorders and brain health. Given promising evidence for the benefits of treatment and prevention, sleep disorders and disturbances represent potential targets for early treatment that may improve brain health more broadly. In this scientific statement, we discuss the evidence supporting an association between sleep disorders and disturbances and poor brain health ranging from stroke to dementia and opportunities for prevention and early treatment.",2024,AHA Scientific Statements; brain; cerebrovascular disorders; dementia; sleep apnea syndromes; sleep disorders,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; American Heart Association; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Sleep; Brain; Stroke; Sleep Wake Disorders,"Gottesman, RF; Lutsey, PL; Benveniste, H; Brown, DL; Full, KM; Lee, JM; Osorio, RS; Pase, MP; Redeker, NS; Redline, S; Spira, AP"
Alzheimer's disease early diagnostic and staging biomarkers revealed by large-scale cerebrospinal fluid and serum proteomic profiling.,"Amyloid-β, tau pathology, and biomarkers of neurodegeneration make up the core diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, these proteins represent only a fraction of the complex biological processes underlying AD, and individuals with other brain diseases in which AD pathology is a comorbidity also test positive for these diagnostic biomarkers. More AD-specific early diagnostic and disease staging biomarkers are needed. In this study, we performed tandem mass tag proteomic analysis of paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples in a discovery cohort comprising 98 participants. Candidate biomarkers were validated by parallel reaction monitoring-based targeted proteomic assays in an independent multicenter cohort comprising 288 participants. We quantified 3,238 CSF and 1,702 serum proteins in the discovery cohort, identifying 171 and 860 CSF proteins and 37 and 323 serum proteins as potential early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. In the validation cohort, 58 and 21 CSF proteins, as well as 12 and 18 serum proteins, were verified as early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. Separate 19-protein CSF and an 8-protein serum biomarker panels were built by machine learning to accurately classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD from normal cognition with areas under the curve of 0.984 and 0.881, respectively. The 19-protein CSF biomarker panel also effectively discriminated patients with MCI due to AD from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we identified 21 CSF and 18 serum stage-associated proteins reflecting AD stages. Our findings provide a foundation for developing blood-based tests for AD screening and staging in clinical practice.",2024,,,"Tao, QQ; Cai, X; Xue, YY; Ge, W; Yue, L; Li, XY; Lin, RR; Peng, GP; Jiang, W; Li, S; Zheng, KM; Jiang, B; Jia, JP; Guo, T; Wu, ZY"
Assess Alzheimer's Disease via Plasma Extracellular Vesicle-derived mRNA.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, has emerged as a significant health concern, particularly due to the increasing aging population. Recently, it has been revealed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) originating from neurons play a critical role in AD pathogenesis and progression. These neuronal EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter peripheral circulation, offering a less invasive means for assessing blood-based AD biomarkers. In this study, we analyzed plasma EV-derived messenger RNA (mRNA) from 82 subjects, including individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to profile their gene expression for functional enrichment and pathway analysis. Based on the differentially expressed genes identified in both MCI and AD groups, we established a diagnostic model by implementing a machine learning classifier. The refined model demonstrated an average diagnostic accuracy over 98% and showed a strong correlation with different AD stages, suggesting the potential of plasma EV-derived mRNA as a promising non-invasive biomarker for early detection and ongoing monitoring of AD.",2023,,,"Phu Pham, LH; Chang, CF; Tuchez, K; Chen, Y"

Golgi-targeting viscosity probe for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Early diagnosis and intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are particularly important to delay the pathological progression. Although fluorescent probes have been widely employed for investigating and diagnosing AD, their biological applications are significantly restricted due to the low penetration ability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. In this study, we reported the first Golgi-targeted two-photon (TP) fluorescent probe, DCM-DH, for detecting viscosity in the Golgi apparatus. The probe was rationally designed to exhibit superior analytical performance including high sensitivity, specific Golgi-targeting, efficient BBB penetration ability, and deep tissue penetration (247 μm) in the brains of AD model mice. Using the probe, we demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the human liver cancer cell (HepG2 cells) was higher than that of human normal liver cell (LO2 cells), and the brain viscosity of AD model mice increased significantly. We anticipate that this competent tool could be easily extended to other AD biomarkers for fundamental research on this detrimental disease.",2024,,Mice; Humans; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Viscosity; Early Detection of Cancer; Brain; Blood-Brain Barrier; Fluorescent Dyes; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Wu, W; Zhao, L; Zhang, Y; Wei, J; Han, J; Zhang, Y; Zhao, Z"
Relationship between topological efficiency of white matter structural connectome and plasma biomarkers across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Both plasma biomarkers and brain network topology have shown great potential in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

This retrospective study evaluated participants from the Sino Longitudinal Study of Cognitive Decline cohort between September 2009 and October 2022 with available blood samples or 3.0-T MRI brain scans. Plasma biomarker levels were measured using the Single Molecule Array platform, including β-amyloid (Aβ), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). The topological structure of brain white matter was assessed using network efficiency. Trend analyses were carried out to evaluate the alterations of the plasma markers and network efficiency with AD progression. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to further explore the relationships among plasma markers, network efficiency, and cognitive performance across the AD continuum.

"Probable chronic pain, brain structure, and Alzheimer's plasma biomarkers in older men.","Chronic pain leads to tau accumulation and hippocampal atrophy in mice. In this study, we provide one of the first assessments in humans, examining the associations of probable chronic pain with hippocampal volume, integrity of the locus coeruleus (LC)-an upstream site of tau deposition-and Alzheimer's Disease-related plasma biomarkers. Participants were mostly cognitively unimpaired men. Probable chronic pain was defined as moderate-to-severe pain in 2+ study waves at average ages 56, 62, and 68. At age 68, 424 participants underwent structural magnestic resonance imaging (MRI) of hippocampal volume and LC-sensitive MRI providing an index of LC integrity (LC contrast-to-noise ratio). Analyses adjusted for confounders including major health conditions, depressive symptoms, and opioid use. Models showed that men with probable chronic pain had smaller hippocampal volume and lower rostral-middle-but not caudal-LC contrast-to-noise ratio compared to men without probable chronic pain. Men with probable chronic pain also had higher levels of plasma total tau, beta-amyloid-42, and beta-amyloid-40 compared to men without probable chronic pain. These findings suggest that probable chronic pain is associated with tau accumulation and reduced structural brain integrity in regions affected early in the development of Alzheimer's Disease.

Prognostic accuracy of 70 individual frailty biomarkers in predicting mortality in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging.,"The frailty index (FI) uses a deficit accumulation approach to derive a single, comprehensive, and replicable indicator of age-related health status. Yet, many researchers continue to seek a single ""frailty biomarker"" to facilitate clinical screening. We investigated the prognostic accuracy of 70 individual biomarkers in predicting mortality, comparing each with a composite FI. A total of 29,341 individuals from the comprehensive cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging were included (mean, 59.4 ± 9.9 years; 50.3% female). Twenty-three blood-based biomarkers and 47 test-based biomarkers (e.g., physical, cardiac, cardiology) were examined. Two composite FIs were derived: FI-Blood and FI-Examination. Mortality status was ascertained using provincial vital statistics linkages and contact with next of kin. Areas under the curve were calculated to compare prognostic accuracy across models (i.e., age, sex, biomarker, FI) in predicting mortality. Compared to an age-sex only model, the addition of individual biomarkers demonstrated improved model fit for 24/70 biomarkers (11 blood, 13 test-based). Inclusion of FI-Blood or FI-Examination improved mortality prediction when compared to any of the 70 biomarker-age-sex models. Individual addition of seven biomarkers (walking speed, chair rise, time up and go, pulse, red blood cell distribution width, C-reactive protein, white blood cells) demonstrated an improved fit when added to the age-sex-FI model. FI scores had better mortality risk prediction than any biomarker. Although seven biomarkers demonstrated improved prognostic accuracy when considered alongside an FI score, all biomarkers had worse prognostic accuracy on their own.

Vascular stability depends on angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT-1) signalling, antagonised by angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT-2) expressed upon endothelial injury. We examined the relationship between CSF ANGPT-2 and CSF markers of BBB leakiness and core AD biomarkers across three independent cohorts: (i) 31 AD patients and 33 healthy controls grouped according to their biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and Aβ42 < 550 pg/mL); (ii) 121 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research study (84 participants cognitively unimpaired (CU) enriched for a parental history of AD, 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 17 with AD); (iii) a neurologically normal cohort aged 23-78 years with paired CSF and serum samples. CSF ANGPT-2, sPDGFRβ, albumin and fibrinogen levels were measured by sandwich ELISA. In cohort (i), CSF ANGPT-2 was elevated in AD and correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau181 but not Aβ42. ANGPT-2 also correlated positively with CSF sPDGFRβ and fibrinogen - markers of pericyte injury and BBB leakiness. In cohort (ii), CSF ANGPT-2 was highest in MCI and correlated with CSF albumin in the CU and MCI cohorts but not in AD. CSF ANGPT-2 also correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau and with markers of neuronal injury (neurogranin and α-synuclein) and neuroinflammation (GFAP and YKL-40). In cohort (iii), CSF ANGPT-2 correlated strongly with the CSF/serum albumin ratio. Serum ANGPT-2 showed non-significant positive associations with CSF ANGPT-2 and the CSF/serum albumin ratio. Together, these data indicate that CSF and possibly serum ANGPT-2 is associated with BBB leakiness in early AD and is closely related to tau pathology and neuronal injury. The utility of serum ANGPT-2 as a biomarker of BBB damage in AD requires further study.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Angiopoietin-2; Biomarkers; Blood-Brain Barrier; Fibrinogen; Serum Albumin,"Van Hulle, C; Ince, S; Okonkwo, OC; Bendlin, BB; Johnson, SC; Carlsson, CM; Asthana, S; Love, S; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Scott Miners, J"

Enabling Lipidomic Biomarker Studies for Protected Populations by Combining Noninvasive Fingerprint Sampling with MS Analysis and Machine Learning.,"Triacylglycerols and wax esters are two lipid classes that have been linked to diseases, including autism, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, cardiovascular disease, dry eye disease, and diabetes, and thus are molecules worthy of biomarker exploration studies. Since triacylglycerols and wax esters make up the majority of skin-surface lipid secretions, a viable sampling method for these potential biomarkers would be that of groomed latent fingerprints. Currently, however, blood-based sampling protocols predominate in the field. The invasiveness of a blood draw limits its utility to protected populations, including children and the elderly. Herein we describe a noninvasive means for sample collection (from fingerprints) paired with fast MS data-acquisition (MassIVE data set MSV000092742) and efficient data analysis via machine learning. Using both supervised and unsupervised classification, we demonstrate the usefulness of this method in determining whether a variable of interest imparts measurable change within the lipidomic data set. As a proof-of-concept, we show that the method is capable of distinguishing between the fingerprints of different individuals as well as between anatomical sebum collection regions. This noninvasive, high-throughput approach enables future lipidomic biomarker researchers to more easily include underrepresented, protected populations, such as children and the elderly, thus moving the field closer to definitive disease diagnoses that apply to all.",2024,biomarkers; fingerprints; lipidomics; lipids; machine learning; mass spectrometry; noninvasive sampling,,"Isom, M; Go, EP; Desaire, H"
Fluid and tissue biomarkers in Parkinson's disease: Immunodetection or seed amplification? Central or peripheral?,"Over the last two decades there have been meaningful developments on biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, extensively (but not solely) focusing on their proteinopathic nature. Accordingly, in Alzheimer's disease determination of levels of total and phosphorylated tau (τ and p-τ, usually p-τ181) along with amyloid-beta1-42 (Aβ1-42) by immunodetection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and currently even in peripheral blood, have been widely accepted and introduced to routine diagnosis. In the case of Parkinson's disease, α-synuclein as a potential biomarker (both for diagnosis and progression tracking) has proved more elusive under the immunodetection approach. In recent years, the emergence of the so-called seed amplification assays is proving to be a game-changer, with mounting evidence under different technical approaches and using a variety of biofluids or tissues, yielding promising diagnostic accuracies. Currently the least invasive but at once more reliable source of biosamples and techniques are being sought.

Plasma p-tau212: antemortem diagnostic performance and prediction of autopsy verification of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.,"Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, including p-tau217, show high associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic change and clinical stage. Certain plasma p-tau217 assays recognize tau forms phosphorylated additionally at threonine-212, but the contribution of p-tau212 alone to AD is unknown. We developed a blood-based immunoassay that is specific to p-tau212 without cross-reactivity to p-tau217. Thereafter, we examined the diagnostic utility of plasma p-tau212. In five cohorts (n=388 participants), plasma p-tau212 showed high performances for AD diagnosis and for the detection of both amyloid and tau pathology, including at autopsy as well as in memory clinic populations. The diagnostic accuracy and fold changes of plasma p-tau212 were similar to those for p-tau217 but higher than p-tau181 and p-tau231. Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue slices showed prominent p-tau212 reactivity in neurofibrillary tangles that co-localized with p-tau217 and p-tau202/205.

Meta-analysis of the serum/plasma proteome identifies significant associations between COVID-19 with Alzheimer's/Parkinson's diseases.,"In recent years, we have seen the widespread devastations and serious health complications manifested by COVID-19 globally. Although we have effectively controlled the pandemic, uncertainties persist regarding its potential long-term effects, including prolonged neurological issues. To gain comprehensive insights, we conducted a meta-analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data retrieved from different studies with a total of 538 COVID-19 patients and 523 healthy controls. The meta-analysis revealed that top-enriched pathways were associated with neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Further analysis confirmed a direct correlation in the expression patterns of 24 proteins involved in Alzheimer's and 23 proteins in Parkinson's disease with COVID-19.

Optimal blood tau species for the detection of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology: an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and autopsy study.,"Plasma-to-autopsy studies are essential for validation of blood biomarkers and understanding their relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Few such studies have been done on phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and those that exist have made limited or no comparison of the different p-tau variants. This study is the first to use immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to compare the accuracy of eight different plasma tau species in predicting autopsy-confirmed AD. The sample included 123 participants (AD = 69, non-AD = 54) from the Boston University Alzheimer's disease Research Center who had an available ante-mortem plasma sample and donated their brain. Plasma samples proximate to death were analyzed by targeted IP-MS for six different tryptic phosphorylated (p-tau-181, 199, 202, 205, 217, 231), and two non-phosphorylated tau (195-205, 212-221) peptides. NIA-Reagan Institute criteria were used for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Binary logistic regressions tested the association between each plasma peptide and autopsy-confirmed AD status. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) statistics were generated using predicted probabilities from the logistic regression models. Odds Ratio (OR) was used to study associations between the different plasma tau species and CERAD and Braak classifications. All tau species were increased in AD compared to non-AD, but p-tau217, p-tau205 and p-tau231 showed the highest fold-changes. Plasma p-tau217 (AUC = 89.8), p-tau231 (AUC = 83.4), and p-tau205 (AUC = 81.3) all had excellent accuracy in discriminating AD from non-AD brain donors, even among those with CDR < 1).

Impact of demographics and comorbid conditions on plasma biomarkers concentrations and their diagnostic accuracy in a memory clinic cohort.,"Plasma biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for identifying amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology. Before implementation in routine clinical practice, confounding factors modifying their concentration beyond neurodegenerative diseases should be identified. We studied the association of a comprehensive list of demographics, comorbidities, medication and laboratory parameters with plasma p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) on a prospective memory clinic cohort and studied their impact on diagnostic accuracy for discriminating CSF/amyloid PET-defined Aβ status. Three hundred sixty patients (mean age 66.5 years, 55% females, 53% Aβ positive) were included. Sex, age and Aβ status-adjusted models showed that only estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, standardized β -0.115 [-0.192 to -0.035], p = 0.005) was associated with p-tau181 levels, although with a much smaller effect than Aβ status (0.685 [0.607-0.763], p < 0.001). Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and eGFR significantly modified GFAP concentration. Age, blood volume (BV) and eGFR were associated with NfL levels. p-tau181 predicted Aβ status with 87% sensitivity and specificity with no relevant increase in diagnostic performance by adding any of the confounding factors. Using two cut-offs, plasma p-tau181 could have spared 62% of amyloid-PET/CSF testing. Excluding patients with chronic kidney disease did not change the proposed cut-offs nor the diagnostic performance. In conclusion, in a memory clinic cohort, age, sex, eGFR, BMI, BV and CCI slightly modified plasma p-tau181, GFAP and NfL concentrations but their impact on the diagnostic accuracy of plasma biomarkers for Aβ status discrimination was minimal.",2024,Blood biomarkers; Comorbidities; Dementia; Diagnostic performance; Neurodegenerative diseases,Female; Humans; Aged; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Biomarkers; Blood Volume; Demography; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins,"Sarto, J; Esteller-Gauxax, D; Tort-Merino, A; Guillén, N; Pérez-Millan, A; Falgàs, N; Borrego-Écija, S; Fernández-Villullas, G; Bosch, B; Juncà-Parella, J; Antonell, A; Naranjo, L; Ruiz-García, R; Augé, JM; Sánchez-Valle, R; Lladó, A; Balasa, M"

Blood Neurofilament Levels Predict Cognitive Decline across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum.,"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a potential diagnostic and prognostic plasma biomarker for numerous neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the relationship between baseline plasma concentration of Nfl and Mild Cognitive Impairment in participants who did and did not have a clinically determined diagnosis of dementia by the end of the three-year study. Additionally, we explored the connection between baseline plasma concentration of NfL and AD dementia patients, considering their demographics, clinical features, and cognitive profiles. A total of 350 participants from the Biomarker of AmyLoid pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk (BALTAZAR) multicenter prospective study were investigated: 161 AD dementia participants and 189 MCI participants (of which 141 had amnestic MCI and 48 non-amnestic MCI). Plasma biomarkers were measured at baseline and the progression of clinical and cognitive profiles was followed over the three years of follow-up. Baseline plasma NfL concentration increased across the Alzheimer's disease continuum with a mean NfL value of 17.1 ng/mL [SD = 6.1] in non-amnestic MCI, 20.7 ng/mL [SD = 12.0] in amnestic MCI, and 23.1 ng/mL [SD = 22.7] in AD dementia patients. Plasma NfL concentration correlated with age, body mass index (BMI), and global cognitive performance and decline, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MMSE scores decreased in parallel with increasing plasma NfL concentration, independently of age and BMI. However, NfL concentration did not predict MCI participants' conversion to dementia within three years.

Generation and Characterization of a Human-Derived and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Line from an Alzheimer's Disease Patient with Neuropsychiatric Symptoms.,"Agitation is one of the most eminent characteristics of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affecting people living with Alzheimer's and Dementia and has serious consequences for patients and caregivers. The current consensus is that agitation results, in part, from the disruption of ascending monoamine regulators of cortical circuits, especially the loss of serotonergic activity. It is believed that the first line of treatment for these conditions is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but these are effective in only about 40% of patients. Person-specific biomarkers, for example, ones based on in vitro iPSC-derived models of serotonin activity, which predict who with Agitation responds to an SSRI, are a major clinical priority. Here, we report the generation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a 74-year-old AD patient, the homozygous APOE ε4/ε4 carrier, who developed Agitation.

Association Between Wnt Target Genes and Cortical Volumes in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The disproportionate cortical atrophy is an established biomarker for the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the genetic basis underlying the cortical atrophy remains poorly defined. Herein, we aim to illustrate the effect of the Wnt target genes on the cortical volumes of AD patients. 82 sporadic AD patients were recruited. All the subjects had history survey, blood biochemical examination, cognitive assessment, MRI morphometry and whole exome sequencing. This report focused on 84 common variants (minor allele frequency > 0.01) of 32 Wnt target genes, including the APC, DAAM1, DACT1, DISC1, LATS2, TLR2, WDR61, and the AXIN, DVL, FZD, LRP, TCF/LEF, WNT family genes. The Wnt target genes showed asymmetric effects on the cortical volumes of AD patients. The right temporal/parietal/occipital cortices were more affected than left temporal/parietal/occipital cortices. Nevertheless, the reverse applied to the frontal cortex. The DACT1 affected the cortical thickness most, followed by the TCF3 and APC. The DACT1 rs698025-GG genotype displayed greater right temporal pole and left medial orbito-frontal gyrus than rs698025-GA genotype (2.4 ± 0.4 vs. 2.0 ± 0.6, P = 0.005; 5.2 ± 0.6 vs. 5.0 ± 0.6, P = 0.001). The brain region most influenced by the Wnt target genes was the right calcarine cortex. In conclusion, the common variants of the Wnt target genes exert asymmetric effects on the cortical volumes of AD patients. The Wnt signaling pathway may play a role in the cortical atrophy of AD patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cortical atrophy; Cortical volume; MRI; Wnt signaling pathway,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Temporal Lobe; Frontal Lobe; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Atrophy; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Nuclear Proteins; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing","Dong, L; Hou, B; Liu, C; Mao, C; Huang, X; Shang, L; Chu, S; Peng, B; Cui, L; Feng, F; Gao, J"
Proteome Profiling of Brain Vessels in a Mouse Model of Cerebrovascular Pathology.,"Cerebrovascular pathology that involves altered protein levels (or signaling) of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) family has been associated with various forms of age-related dementias, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Transgenic mice overexpressing TGFβ1 in the brain (TGF mice) recapitulate VCID-associated cerebrovascular pathology and develop cognitive deficits in old age or when submitted to comorbid cardiovascular risk factors for dementia. We characterized the cerebrovascular proteome of TGF mice using mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics. Cerebral arteries were surgically removed from 6-month-old-TGF and wild-type mice, and proteins were extracted and analyzed by gel-free nanoLC-MS/MS. We identified 3602 proteins in brain vessels, with 20 demonstrating significantly altered levels in TGF mice.

Biomarkers associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative neurological illness with insidious onset. Due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of AD and different pathological changes, the clinical phenotypes of dementia are diverse, and these pathological changes also interact with each other. Therefore, it is of great significance to search for biomarkers that can diagnose these pathological changes to improve the ability to monitor the course of disease and treat the disease. The pathological mechanism hypothesis with high recognition of AD mainly includes the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) around neurons and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which results in the development of neuronal fiber tangles (NFTs) and mitochondrial dysfunction. AD is an irreversible disease; currently, there is no clinical cure or delay in the disease process of drugs, and there is a lack of effective early clinical diagnosis methods. AD patients, often in the dementia stages and moderate cognitive impairment, will seek medical treatment. Biomarkers can help diagnose the presence or absence of specific diseases and their pathological processes, so early screening and diagnosis are crucial for the prevention and therapy of AD in clinical practice. β-amyloid deposition (A), tau pathology (T), and neurodegeneration/neuronal damage (N), also known as the AT (N) biomarkers system, are widely validated core humoral markers for the diagnosis of AD. In this paper, the pathogenesis of AD related to AT (N) and the current research status of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood related biomarkers were reviewed. At the same time, the limitations of humoral markers in the diagnosis of AD were also discussed, and the future development of humoral markers for AD was prospected. In addition, the contents related to mitochondrial dysfunction, prion virology and intestinal microbiome related to AD are also described, so as to understand the pathogenesis of AD in many aspects and dimensions, so as to evaluate the pathological changes related to AD more comprehensively and accurately.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ; NFTs; biomarkers; tau,,"Wang, H; Sun, M; Li, W; Liu, X; Zhu, M; Qin, H"

Blood biomarkers are less invasive, easier to obtain and achievable by a cheaper means than those on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and significantly more economic than functional neuroimaging investigations; thus, a great interest is focused on blood isoforms of the phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau), indicators of ongoing tau pathology (i.e. neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs, an AD neuropathological hallmark) in the central nervous system (CNS). However, current data often highlight discordant results about the ability of blood pTau to predict CSF status.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Blood; CSF; Plasma; pTau,Humans; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphorylation,"Antonioni, A; Raho, EM; Di Lorenzo, F"

The Australian Traumatic Brain Injury Initiative: Systematic Review of Predictive Value of Biological Markers for People With Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"The Australian Traumatic Brain Injury Initiative (AUS-TBI) aims to co-design a data resource to predict outcomes for people with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) across Australia. Fundamental to this resource is the data dictionary, which is an ontology of data items. Here, we report the systematic review and consensus process for inclusion of biological markers in the data dictionary. Standardized database searches were implemented from inception through April 2022. English-language studies evaluating association between a fluid, tissue, or imaging marker and any clinical outcome in at least 10 patients with moderate-severe TBI were included. Records were screened using a prioritization algorithm and saturation threshold in Research Screener. Full-length records were then screened in Covidence. A pre-defined algorithm was used to assign a judgement of predictive value to each observed association, and high-value predictors were discussed in a consensus process. Searches retrieved 106,593 records; 1,417 full-length records were screened, resulting in 546 included records. Two hundred thirty-nine individual markers were extracted, evaluated against 101 outcomes. Forty-one markers were judged to be high-value predictors of 15 outcomes. Fluid markers retained following the consensus process included ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), S100, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Imaging markers included computed tomography (CT) scores (e.g., Marshall scores), pathological observations (e.g., hemorrhage, midline shift), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification (e.g., diffuse axonal injury). Clinical context and time of sampling of potential predictive indicators are important considerations for utility. This systematic review and consensus process has identified fluid and imaging biomarkers with high predictive value of clinical and long-term outcomes following moderate-severe TBI.",2024,"biomarkers; body fluids; brain injuries, traumatic; common data elements; magnetic resonance imaging; systematic review [publication type]; tissues; tomography, X-ray computed",,"Bagg, MK; Hellewell, SC; Keeves, J; Antonic-Baker, A; McKimmie, A; Hicks, AJ; Gadowski, A; Newcombe, VFJ; Barlow, KM; Balogh, ZJ; Ross, JP; Law, M; Caeyenberghs, K; Parizel, PM; Thorne, J; Papini, M; Gill, G; Jefferson, A; Ponsford, JL; Lannin, NA; O'Brien, TJ; Cameron, PA; Cooper, DJ; Rushworth, N; Gabbe, BJ; Fitzgerald, M"

Proximity extension assay-based proteomics studies in neurodegenerative disorders and multiple sclerosis.,"Neurodegenerative diseases impact the structure and operation of the nervous system, causing progressive and irreparable harm. Efforts for distinguishing neurodegenerative diseases in their early stages are continuing. Despite several biomarkers being identified, there is always search for more accurate and abundant ones. Additionally, it can be difficult to pinpoint the precise neurodegenerative disorder affecting a patient as the symptoms of these conditions frequently overlap. Numerous studies have shown that pathological changes occur years before clinical signs appear. Therefore, it is crucial to discover blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases for easier and earlier diagnosis. Proximity extension assay is a unique proteomics method that uses antibodies linked to oligonucleotides for quantifying proteins with real-time PCR. Proximity extension assay can identify even low-quantity proteins using a small volume of specimens with increased sensitivity compared to conventional methods. In this article, we reviewed the employment of proximity extension assay technology to detect biomarkers or protein profiles for several neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease; biomarker; neurodegenerative diseases; proteomics,Humans; Proteomics; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Biomarkers; Early Diagnosis,"Arioz, BI; Cotuk, A; Yaka, EC; Genc, S"
Implementation of an ultra-sensitive microwell-based electrochemical sensor for the detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in elderly people. It is diagnosed by detecting amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture or through expensive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Although blood-based diagnosis of AD offers a less invasive and cost-effective alternative, the quantification of Aβ is technically challenging due to its low abundance in peripheral blood. To address this, we developed a compact yet highly sensitive microwell-based electrochemical sensor with a densely packed microelectrode array (20 by 20) for enhancing sensitivity. Employing microwells on the working and counter electrodes minimized the leakage current from the metallic conductors into the assay medium, refining the signal fidelity. We achieved a detection limit <10 fg/mL for Aβ by elevating the signal-to-noise ratio, thus capable of AD biomarker quantification. Moreover, the microwell structure maintained the performance irrespective of variations in bead number, indicative of the sensor's robustness. The sensor's efficacy was validated through the analysis of Aβ concentrations in plasma samples from 96 subjects, revealing a significant distinction between AD patients and healthy controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85. Consequently, our novel microwell-based electrochemical biosensor represents a highly sensitive platform for detecting scant blood-based biomarkers, including Aβ, offering substantial potential for advancing AD diagnostics.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid Beta; Limits of Detection (LOD); Magnetic beads; Microwell-based electrochemical sensor; Patient plasma sample,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biosensing Techniques; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Microelectrodes; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Roy, S; Kang, S; Choi, KY; Lee, KH; Shin, KS; Kang, JY"
Altered cerebrovascular-CSF coupling in Alzheimer's Disease measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy.,"In-vivo microscopical studies indicate that brain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport driven by blood vessel pulsations is reduced in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that the coupling pattern between cerebrovascular pulsations and CSF is altered in AD, and this can be measured using multi-wavelength functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). To study this, we quantified simultaneously cerebral hemo- and CSF hydrodynamics in early AD patients and age-matched healthy controls. Physiological pulsations were analysed in the vasomotor very low frequency (VLF 0.008-0.1 Hz), respiratory (Resp. 0.1-0.6 Hz), and cardiac (Card. 0.6-5 Hz) bands. A sliding time window cross-correlation approach was used to estimate the temporal stability of the cerebrovascular-CSF coupling. We investigated how the lag time series variation of the coupling differs between AD patients and control. The couplings involving deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and CSF water, along with their first derivative, in the cardiac band demonstrated significant difference between AD patients and controls. Furthermore, the lag time series variation of HbR-CSF in the cardiac band provided a significant relationship, p-value = 0.04 and r",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; tau Proteins; Brain; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Ferdinando, H; Moradi, S; Korhonen, V; Kiviniemi, V; Myllylä, T"

Identification of candidate DNA methylation biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease risk by integrating genome and blood methylome data.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with a late onset. It is critical to identify novel blood-based DNA methylation biomarkers to better understand the extent of the molecular pathways affected in AD. Two sets of blood DNA methylation genetic prediction models developed using different reference panels and modelling strategies were leveraged to evaluate associations of genetically predicted DNA methylation levels with AD risk in 111,326 (46,828 proxy) cases and 677,663 controls. A total of 1,168 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites showed a significant association with AD risk at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. Methylation levels of 196 CpG sites were correlated with expression levels of 130 adjacent genes in blood. Overall, 52 CpG sites of 32 genes showed consistent association directions for the methylation-gene expression-AD risk, including nine genes (CNIH4, THUMPD3, SERPINB9, MTUS1, CISD1, FRAT2, CCDC88B, FES, and SSH2) firstly reported as AD risk genes.

Machine Learning models for detection and assessment of progression in Alzheimer's disease based on blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.,"Machine-learning techniques were applied to human blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data related to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients available via Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We observed the accuracy of AD diagnosis is greatest when protein biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid are combined with plasma proteins using Support Vector Machines (SVM); this is not improved by adding age and sex. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for our model of AD diagnosis based on a full (unbiased) set of plasma proteins was 0.94 in cross-validation and 0.82 on an external validation (test) set. Taking plasma in combination with CSF, the model reaches 0.98 area under the ROC curve on the test set. Accuracy of prediction of risk of mild cognitive impairment progressing to AD is the same for blood plasma biomarkers as for CSF and is not improved by combining them or adding age and sex as covariates.Clinical relevance- The identification of accurate and cost-effective biomarkers to screen for risk of developing AD and monitoring its progression is crucial for improved understanding of its causes and stratification of patients for treatments under development.

Extracellular vesicle proteome unveils cathepsin B connection to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane vesicles that are released extracellularly and considered to be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Here, CSF EVs of 16 ATN-classified cases were subjected to quantitative proteome analysis. In these CSF EVs, levels of 11 proteins were significantly altered during the ATN stage transitions (P < 0.05 and fold-change > 2.0). These proteins were thought to be associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and represent candidate biomarkers for pathogenic stage classification. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of CSF and plasma EVs revealed altered levels of cathepsin B (CatB) during the ATN transition (seven ATN groups in validation set, n = 136). The CSF and plasma EV CatB levels showed a negative correlation with CSF amyloid-β42 concentrations. This proteomic landscape of CSF EVs in ATN classifications can depict the molecular framework of Alzheimer's disease progression, and CatB may be considered a promising candidate biomarker and therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease amyloid pathology.",2024,ATN classification; Alzheimer’s disease; blood biomarker; cathepsin B; extracellular vesicle,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Proteome; Cathepsin B; Proteomics; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Yuyama, K; Sun, H; Fujii, R; Hemmi, I; Ueda, K; Igeta, Y"

Cerebrospinal and Blood Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: Did Mild Cognitive Impairment Definition Affect Their Clinical Usefulness?,"Despite Alzheimer's Disease (AD) being known from the times of Alois Alzheimer, who lived more than one century ago, many aspects of the disease are still obscure, including the pathogenesis, the clinical spectrum definition, and the therapeutic approach. Well-established biomarkers for AD come from the histopathological hallmarks of the disease, which are Aβ and phosphorylated Tau protein aggregates. Consistently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Amyloid β (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau level measurements are currently used to detect AD presence. However, two central biases affect these biomarkers. Firstly, incomplete knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases legitimates the search for novel molecules that, reasonably, could be expressed by neurons and microglia and could be detected in blood simpler and earlier than the classical markers and in a higher amount. Further, studies have been performed to evaluate whether CSF biomarkers can predict AD onset in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. However, the MCI definition has changed over time. Hence, the studies on MCI patients seem to be biased at the beginning due to the imprecise enrollment and heterogeneous composition of the miscellaneous MCI subgroup. Plasma biomarkers and novel candidate molecules, such as microglia biomarkers, have been tentatively investigated and could represent valuable targets for diagnosing and monitoring AD. Also, novel AD markers are urgently needed to identify molecular targets for treatment strategies. This review article summarizes the main CSF and blood AD biomarkers, underpins their advantages and flaws, and mentions novel molecules that can be used as potential biomarkers for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; amyloid β; biomarkers; blood; flaws; phosphorylated tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Bivona, G; Iemmolo, M; Ghersi, G"
Detection of APP gene recombinant in human blood plasma.,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to involve the accumulation of amyloid-β in the brain, which is produced by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Recently, analysis of genomic DNA and mRNA from postmortem brain neurons has revealed intra-exonic recombinants of APP (gencDNA), which have been implicated in the accumulation of amyloid-β. In this study, we computationally analyzed publicly available sequence data (SRA) using probe sequences we constructed to screen APP gencDNAs. APP gencDNAs were detected in SRAs constructed from both genomic DNA and RNA obtained from the postmortem brain and in the SRA constructed from plasma cell-free mRNA (cf-mRNA). The SRA constructed from plasma cf-mRNA showed a significant difference in the number of APP gencDNA reads between SAD and NCI: the p-value from the Mann-Whitney U test was 5.14 × 10",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Plasma; RNA, Messenger; DNA","Mitsunaga, S; Fujito, N; Nakaoka, H; Imazeki, R; Nagata, E; Inoue, I"

Blood Biomarkers Discriminate Cerebral Amyloid Status and Cognitive Diagnosis when Collected with ACD-A Anticoagulant.,"The development of biomarkers that are easy to collect, process, and store is a major goal of research on current Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and underlies the growing interest in plasma biomarkers. Biomarkers with these qualities will improve diagnosis and allow for better monitoring of therapeutic interventions. However, blood collection strategies have historically differed between studies.

Novel brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a methylase blocks Alzheimer's disease proteopathology for precision medication.,"Current amyloid beta-targeting approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics only slow cognitive decline for small numbers of patients. This limited efficacy exists because AD is a multifactorial disease whose pathological mechanism(s) and diagnostic biomarkers are largely unknown. Here we report a new mechanism of AD pathogenesis in which the histone methyltransferase G9a noncanonically regulates translation of a hippocampal proteome that defines the proteopathic nature of AD. Accordingly, we developed a novel brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a, MS1262, across the blood-brain barrier to block this G9a-regulated, proteopathologic mechanism. Intermittent MS1262 treatment of multiple AD mouse models consistently restored both cognitive and noncognitive functions to healthy levels. Comparison of proteomic/phosphoproteomic analyses of MS1262-treated AD mice with human AD patient data identified multiple pathological brain pathways that elaborate amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles as well as blood coagulation, from which biomarkers of early stage of AD including SMOC1 were found to be affected by MS1262 treatment. Notably, these results indicated that MS1262 treatment may reduce or avoid the risk of blood clot burst for brain bleeding or a stroke. This mouse-to-human conservation of G9a-translated AD proteopathology suggests that the global, multifaceted effects of MS1262 in mice could extend to relieve all symptoms of AD patients with minimum side effect. In addition, our mechanistically derived biomarkers can be used for stage-specific AD diagnosis and companion diagnosis of individualized drug effects.",2023,AD cognitive and noncognitive symptoms; AD diagnosis biomarkers; AD pathogenesis; blood-brain barrier (BBB); brain-penetrant inhibitor; companion diagnosis; mechanism of drug action; mechanism-based therapy; mouse-human conservation; noncanonical translational mechanism; proteomics; proteopathology; signaling pathways,,"Chen, X; Xie, L; Sheehy, R; Xiong, Y; Muneer, A; Wrobel, J; Park, KS; Liu, J; Velez, J; Luo, Y; Li, YD; Quintanilla, L; Li, Y; Xu, C; Wen, Z; Song, J; Jin, J; Deshmukh, M"
"Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Hypertension, and Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.","Hypertension-associated cerebral small vessel disease is a common finding in older people. Strongly associated with age and hypertension, small vessel disease is found at autopsy in over 50% of people aged ≥65 years, with a spectrum of clinical manifestations. It is the main cause of lacunar stroke and a major source of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. The brain areas affected are subcortical and periventricular white matter and deep gray nuclei. Neuropathological sequelae are diffuse white matter lesions (seen as white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging), small ischemic foci (lacunes or microinfarcts), and less commonly, subcortical microhemorrhages. The most common form of cerebral small vessel disease is concentric, fibrotic thickening of small penetrating arteries (up to 300 microns outer diameter) termed arteriolosclerosis. Less common forms are small artery atheroma and lipohyalinosis (the lesions described by C. Miller Fisher adjacent to lacunes). Other microvascular lesions that are not reviewed here include cerebral amyloid angiopathy and venous collagenosis. Here, we review the epidemiology, neuropathology, clinical management, genetics, preclinical models, and pathogenesis of hypertensive small vessel disease. Knowledge gaps include initiating factors, molecular pathogenesis, relationships between arterial pathology and tissue damage, possible reversibility, pharmacological targets, and molecular biomarkers.

The Diagnostic Use of the Plasma Quantification of 24S-Hydroxycholesterol and Other Oxysterols in Neurodegenerative Disease.,"Cholesterol regulates fluidity and structure of cellular membranes. The brain is involved in signal transduction, synaptogenesis, and membrane trafficking. An impairment of its metabolism was observed in different neurodegenerative diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer, and Huntington diseases. Because of the blood-brain barrier, cholesterol cannot be uptaken from the circulation and all the cholesterol is locally synthetized. The excess cholesterol in neurons is converted into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) by the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1). The plasmatic concentration of 24OHC results in the balance between cerebral production and liver elimination. It is related to the number of metabolically active neurons in the brain. Several factors that affect the brain cholesterol turnover and the liver elimination of oxysterols, the genetic background, nutrition, and lifestyle habits were found to significantly affect plasma levels of 24OHC. Reduced levels of 24OHC were found related to the loss of metabolically active cells and the degree of brain atrophy. The dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, inflammation, and increased cholesterol turnover might overlap with this progressive reduction giving temporary increased levels of 24OHC.The study of plasma 24OHC is likely to offer an insight into brain cholesterol turnover with a limited diagnostic power.",2024,24S-Hydroxycholesterols; Alzheimer disease; Biomarkers; Cholesterol; Huntington disease; Lipidomic; Mass spectrometry; Multiple sclerosis; Neurodegenerative diseases; Oxysterols; Parkinson disease,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Oxysterols; Hydroxycholesterols; Cholesterol; Brain,"Tripodi, D; Vitarelli, F; Spiti, S; Leoni, V"

Lipids and lipoproteins may play a role in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other classes of dementia are important public health problems with overwhelming social, physical, and financial effects for patients, society, and their families and caregivers. The pathophysiology of AD is poorly understood despite the extensive number of clinical and experimental studies. The brain's lipid-rich composition is linked to disturbances in lipid homeostasis, often associated with glucose and lipid abnormalities in various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Moreover, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels may be related to a higher probability of AD. Here, we hypothesize that lipids, and electronegative LDL (L5) in particular, may be involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Although changes in cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and glucose levels are seen in AD, the cause remains unknown. We believe that L5-the most electronegative subfraction of LDL-may be a crucial factor in understanding the involvement of lipids in AD pathology. LDL and L5 are internalized by cells through different receptors and mechanisms that trigger separate intracellular pathways. One of the receptors involved in L5 internalization, LOX-1, triggers apoptotic pathways. Aging is associated with dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, and it is believed that alterations in lipid metabolism contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Proposed mechanisms of lipid dysregulation in AD include mitochondrial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier disease, neuronal signaling, inflammation, and oxidative stress, all of which lead ultimately to memory loss through deficiency of synaptic integration. Several lipid species and their receptors have essential functions in AD pathogenesis and may be potential biomarkers.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; LDLR; LOX-1; cholesterol; electronegative LDL; lipids,,"Akyol, O; Akyol, S; Chou, MC; Chen, S; Liu, CK; Selek, S; Soares, JC; Chen, CH"
Ketone bodies mediate alterations in brain energy metabolism and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, including learning and memory deficits, and behavioral changes. Neuropathology hallmarks of AD such as amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing the neuron-specific protein tau is associated with changes in fluid biomarkers including Aβ, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)-181, p-tau 231, p-tau 217, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NFL). Another pathological feature of AD is neural damage and hyperactivation of astrocytes, that can cause increased pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress. In addition, reduced brain glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction appears up to 15 years before the onset of clinical AD symptoms. As glucose utilization is compromised in the brain of patients with AD, ketone bodies (KBs) may serve as an alternative source of energy. KBs are generated from the β-oxidation of fatty acids, which are enhanced following consumption of ketogenic diets with high fat, moderate protein, and low carbohydrate. KBs have been shown to cross the blood brain barrier to improve brain energy metabolism. This review comprehensively summarizes the current literature on how increasing KBs support brain energy metabolism. In addition, for the first time, this review discusses the effects of ketogenic diet on the putative AD biomarkers such as Aβ, tau (mainly p-tau 181), GFAP, and NFL, and discusses the role of KBs on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial metabolism.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; brain energy fuel; circulating biomarkers; disease-modifying therapy; ketogenesis; ketogenic intervention; metabolic interaction,,"Ramezani, M; Fernando, M; Eslick, S; Asih, PR; Shadfar, S; Bandara, EMS; Hillebrandt, H; Meghwar, S; Shahriari, M; Chatterjee, P; Thota, R; Dias, CB; Garg, ML; Martins, RN"

We approach here the peculiar techniques through current and previous reports available to find the most plausible and fast way of their expansion to be used in therapeutics. We discuss here the techniques for EPCs isolation from different resources like bone marrow and peripheral blood circulation. EPCs have been isolated by methods which used fibronectin plating and addition of various growth factors to culture media. Particularly, the investigations which tried to enhance EPC differentiation while inducing with growth factors and endothelial nitric oxide synthase are shared.

Effectiveness of the Stress Process Model-Based Program in Dementia Caregiving (DeCare-SPM) for Family Caregivers: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"This paper aims to describe a randomized controlled trial protocol evaluating the effectiveness, cost, and process of a stress process model-based program in dementia caregiving (DeCare-SPM) for family caregivers. Family caregivers of individuals with dementia will be recruited from memory clinics and community settings and randomly assigned to either DeCare-SPM or usual care. DeCare-SPM comprises three face-to-face sessions (ie, problem-based coping, emotion-based coping, meaning-based coping), and a fourth session (ie, social support) including weekly telephone-based consultation for four weeks and then monthly face-to-face boosters. Outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), and at one (T1), three (T2), and six months (T3). The primary outcome is positive aspects of caregiving and secondary outcomes are caregiving (ie, sense of competence, caregiver burden, social support, anxiety, depression, and quality of life), dementia-related (ie, care dependency, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life), and stress-related biomarkers of blood and saliva. In addition, process and economic evaluations will be performed. Mixed-effects models will be used to assess intervention effects. Content analysis will be performed on the qualitative data. This paper described the protocol for comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness, cost, and process of the theory-driven DeCare-SPM to inform how and why interventions work. It highlights the need to reduce challenges and enhance the positive aspects of dementia care. The DeCare-SPM will provide evidence-based insights into how to support and empower family caregivers in their important roles, thereby, leading to improved dementia care.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; community; informal caregivers; psychosocial; stress coping,,"Wang, J; Chen, H; Yang, L; Yu, X; Zhang, D; Zhao, Q; Xiao, M"
Operationalizing selection criteria for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease: Biomarker and clinical considerations.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) staging criteria lack standardized, empirical description. Well-defined AD staging criteria are an important consideration in protocol design, influencing a more standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria and defining what constitutes meaningful differentiation among the stages. However, many trials are being designed on the basis of biomarker features and the two need to be coordinated. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) Spring 2021 meeting discussed the implementation of preclinical AD staging criteria, and provided recommendations for how they may best be incorporated into clinical trials research. Discussion also included what currently available tools for global clinical trials may best define populations in preclinical AD trials, and if are we able to differentiate preclinical from clinical stages of the disease. Well-defined AD staging criteria are key to improving early detection, diagnostics, clinical trial enrollment, and identifying statistically significant clinical changes, and researchers discussed how emerging blood biomarkers may help with more efficient screening in preclinical stages.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; amyloid; biomarkers; clinical trials; cognition; cognitive impairment; dementia; mild cognitive impairment; tau,,"Petersen, RC; Graf, A; Brady, C; De Santi, S; Florian, H; Landen, J; Pontecorvo, M; Randolph, C; Sink, KM; Carrillo, MC; Weber, CJ"
Detection of neuron-derived cfDNA in blood plasma: a new diagnostic approach for neurodegenerative conditions.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose significant challenges in early diagnosis, leading to irreversible brain damage and cognitive decline. In this study, we present a novel diagnostic approach that utilizes whole molecule analysis of neuron-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing Differential Methylation Regions (DMRs) between purified cortical neurons and blood plasma samples, we identified robust biomarkers that accurately distinguish between neuronal and non-neuronal cfDNA. The use of cfDNA offers the advantage of convenient and minimally invasive sample collection compared to traditional cerebrospinal fluid or tissue biopsies, making this approach more accessible and patient friendly. Targeted sequencing at the identified DMR locus demonstrated that a conservative cutoff of 5% of neuron-derived cfDNA in blood plasma accurately identifies 100% of patients diagnosed with AD, showing promising potential for early disease detection. Additionally, this method effectively differentiated between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who later progressed to AD and those who did not, highlighting its prognostic capabilities. Importantly, the differentiation between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls demonstrated the specificity of our approach. Furthermore, this cfDNA-based diagnostic strategy outperforms recently developed protein-based assays, which often lack accuracy and convenience. While our current approach focused on a limited set of loci, future research should explore the development of a more comprehensive model incorporating multiple loci to increase diagnostic accuracy further. Although certain limitations, such as technical variance associated with PCR amplification and bisulfite conversion, need to be addressed, this study emphasizes the potential of cfDNA analysis as a valuable tool for pre-symptomatic detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. With further development and validation, this innovative diagnostic strategy has the potential to significantly impact the field of neurodegenerative disease research and patient care, offering a promising avenue for early intervention and personalized therapeutic approaches.",2023,Alzheimer’s; DNA methylation; cfDNA; disease monitoring; neurodegenerative diseases; pre-symptomatic diagnostic,,"Pollard, C; Aston, K; Emery, BR; Hill, J; Jenkins, T"

Supercomplex formation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in leukocytes from patients with neurodegenerative diseases.,"With population aging, cognitive impairments and movement disorders due to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are increasingly considered as key social issues. Clinically, it has remained challenging to diagnose them before the onset of symptoms because of difficulty to observe the progressive loss of neurons in the brain. Therefore, with exploratory research into biomarkers, a number of candidates have previously been proposed, such as activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in blood in AD and PD. In this study, we focused on the formation of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes (SCs) because the formation of SC itself modulates the activity of each complex. Here we investigated the SC formation in leukocytes from patients with AD, PD and DLB. Our results showed that SCs were well formed in AD and PD compared with controls, while poorly formed in DLB. We highlighted that the disruption of the SC formation correlated with the progression of PD and DLB. Taking our findings together, we propose that pronounced SC formation would already have occurred before the onset of AD, PD and DLB and, with the progression of neurodegeneration, the SC formation would gradually be disrupted.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; dementia with Lewy bodies; high-resolution clear native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; in-gel activity assay; mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Electron Transport; Leukocytes; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease,"Hara, T; Amagai, R; Sakakibara, R; Okado-Matsumoto, A"

Effects of Neighboring Phosphorylation Events on the Affinities of pT181-Tau Antibodies.,"A tau variant phosphorylated on threonine 181 (pT181-tau) has been widely investigated as a potential Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. pT181-tau is present in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of AD brains, and CSF levels of pT181-tau correlate with the overall NFT burden. Various immunobased analytical methods, including Western blotting and ELISA, have been used to quantify pT181-tau in human biofluids. The reliability of these methods is dependent on the affinity and binding specificity of the antibodies used to measure pT181-tau levels. Although both of these properties could, in principle, be affected by phosphorylation within or near the antibody's cognate antigen, such effects have not been extensively studied. Here, we developed a biolayer interferometry assay to determine the degree to which the affinity of pT181-tau antibodies is altered by the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues near the target epitope. Our results revealed that phosphorylation near T181 negatively affected the binding of pT181-tau antibodies to their cognate antigen to varying degrees. In particular, two of three antibodies tested showed a complete loss of affinity for the pT181 target when S184 or S185 was phosphorylated. These findings highlight the importance of selecting antibodies that have been thoroughly characterized in terms of affinity and binding specificity, addressing the potential disruptive effects of post-translational modifications in the epitope region to ensure accurate biomarker quantitation.",2023,,Humans; Phosphorylation; tau Proteins; Reproducibility of Results; Alzheimer Disease; Antibodies; Antigens; Epitopes; Threonine; Biomarkers,"Min, S; Mohallem, R; Aryal, UK; Kinzer-Ursem, TL; Rochet, JC"

"Potential Implications of miRNAs in the Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Therapeutics of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial disorder that poses a substantial burden on patients, caregivers, and society. Considering the increased aging population and life expectancy, the incidence of AD will continue to rise in the following decades. However, the molecular pathogenesis of AD remains controversial, superior blood-based biomarker candidates for early diagnosis are still lacking, and effective therapeutics to halt or slow disease progression are urgently needed. As powerful genetic regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) are receiving increasing attention due to their implications in the initiation, development, and theranostics of various diseases, including AD. In this review, we summarize miRNAs that directly target microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) transcripts and regulate the alternative splicing of tau and APP. We also discuss related kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), as well as apolipoprotein E, that are directly targeted by miRNAs to control tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenic APP processing leading to Aβ pathologies. Moreover, there is evidence of miRNA-mediated modulation of inflammation. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs in the serum or plasma of AD patients as noninvasive biomarkers with diagnostic potential are reviewed.

Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of protein have been confirmed, and recently, very high concentrations of CSF total and phosphorylated tau have been detected in Skogholt patients. The symptoms and observed biomarker changes in Skogholt's disease are largely nonspecific, and further studies are necessary to elucidate the disease mechanisms. Here, we report the results of neurochemical analyses of plasma and CSF, as well as results from the morphometric segmentation of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging.

IC3 protocol: a longitudinal observational study of cognition after stroke using novel digital health technology.,"Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, frequently resulting in persistent cognitive deficits among survivors. These deficits negatively impact recovery and therapy engagement, and their treatment is consistently rated as high priority by stakeholders and clinicians. Although clinical guidelines endorse cognitive screening for poststroke management, there is currently no gold-standard approach for identifying cognitive deficits after stroke, and clinical stroke services lack the capacity for long-term cognitive monitoring and care. Currently, available assessment tools are either not stroke-specific, not in-depth or lack scalability, leading to heterogeneity in patient assessments.",2023,Cognitive testing; biomarkers; cerebrovascular disease; observational study; stroke,Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Observational Studies as Topic,"Gruia, DC; Trender, W; Hellyer, P; Banerjee, S; Kwan, J; Zetterberg, H; Hampshire, A; Geranmayeh, F"
Nano-Brush Structure for Rapid Label-Free Differentiation of Alzheimer's Disease Stages and Direct Capture of Neuron-Derived Exosomes from Human Blood Plasma.,"The measurement of the neurofilament light chain (NFL) in human blood plasma/serum is a promising liquid biopsy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, offering advantages over conventional neuroimaging techniques recommended in clinical guidelines. Here, a controllable nano-brush structure comprising upstanding silicon nanowires coated with indium tin oxide was employed as the sensing substrate. This nano-brush structure was modified with an NFL antibody (NFLAb) via silane coupling and then further connected as the extended gate in a field-effect transistor (EGFET). Notable signal differences emerged within a 2 min timeframe, enabling the label-free differentiation in human blood plasmas among four distinct cohorts: healthy controls, subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia due to AD. Our study indicates that achieving a surface roughness exceeding 400 nm on the modified nano-brush structure enables the effective electrical sensing in our EGFETs. These distinct electrical responses measured via the NFLAb-modified nano-brush EGFETs can be attributed to the combined effects of the captured NFLs and NFL-specific neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) found in dementia patients, as confirmed by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Finally, the potential of quantitatively detecting NDEs on the NFLAb-modified nano-brush structure was demonstrated using spiked solutions containing NFL-specific NDEs from IMR-32 neuroblast cells, wherein concentration-dependent changes were observed in the EGFETs output signal. Our findings show that the NFLAb-modified nano-brush EGFET enables rapid, label-free differentiation between healthy individuals and patients at varying stages of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease stage; nano-brush structure; neurofilament light chain; neuron-derived exosome; sensing substrate; upstanding nanowires,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Exosomes; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neurons; Plasma; Biomarkers,"Lin, SP; Lee, WJ; Sun, MC; Yang, YH; Vinzons, LU; Lin, YM; Wei, YT"

Specific serum autoantibodies predict the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease with high accuracy.,"Autoimmunity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether autoantibodies in peripheral blood can be used as biomarkers for AD has been elusive. Serum samples were obtained from 1,686 participants, including 767 with AD, 146 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 255 with other neurodegenerative diseases, and 518 healthy controls. Specific autoantibodies were measured using a custom-made immunoassay. Multivariate support vector machine models were employed to investigate the correlation between serum autoantibody levels and disease states. As a result, seven candidate AD-specific autoantibodies were identified, including MAPT, DNAJC8, KDM4D, SERF1A, CDKN1A, AGER, and ASXL1. A classification model with high accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.94) was established. Importantly, these autoantibodies could distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative diseases and out-performed amyloid and tau protein concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid in predicting cognitive decline (P < 0.001). This study indicated that AD onset and progression are possibly accompanied by an unappreciated serum autoantibody response. Therefore, future studies could optimize its application as a convenient biomarker for the early detection of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarker; Early detection; Predicting; Serum autoantibodies,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Autoantibodies; Disease Progression; Peptide Fragments; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases; Nerve Tissue Proteins,"Fang, L; Jiao, B; Liu, X; Wang, Z; Yuan, P; Zhou, H; Xiao, X; Cao, L; Guo, J; Tang, B; Shen, L"

"Trajectories of CSF and plasma biomarkers across Alzheimer's disease continuum: disease staging by NF-L, p-tau181, and GFAP.","CSF-to-plasma transition will open new avenues for molecular phenotyping of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we evaluated a panel of AD biomarkers in matched CSF and plasma samples across the AD continuum, from preclinical AD to dementia. The aims were to: 1) compare diagnostic performance of the two biofluids, 2) evaluate trajectories of the biomarkers along AD progression. We analyzed CSF and plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau231, t-tau, NF-L, GFAP, UCHL-1 and CSF SNAP-25 in a cohort (n = 173) of preclinical AD, MCI-AD, AD dementia, frontotemporal dementia patients, and controls. We found a significant correlation between CSF and plasma levels of Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau231, NF-L, and GFAP, while no CSF-plasma correlation was observed for t-tau and UCHL-1. Next to the core CSF biomarkers (Aβ42/40, p-tau181, t-tau), those providing the best discrimination between controls and preclinical AD were CSF p-tau231 and SNAP-25 and plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau231, and GFAP. Among plasma biomarkers, we found Aβ42/Aβ40, GFAP, and p-tau231 to show the largest rate of change at the CSF biomarker-defined cut-offs for amyloidosis and tauopathy. Finally, we identified GFAP, NF-L, and p-tau181 as the biomarkers most significantly associated with disease progression in both CSF and plasma. We suggest that a well-standardized and validated panel of selected plasma markers can facilitate early AD diagnosis, even at the asymptomatic disease stage. We propose that both CSF and plasma measurement of NF-L, p-tau181, and GFAP may play a significant role in disease staging and monitoring.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Biomarkers; Blood; Cerebrospinal fluid; Frontotemporal dementia; Simoa; preclinical Alzheimer's disease,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloidosis; Biomarkers; tau Proteins,"Wojdała, AL; Bellomo, G; Gaetani, L; Toja, A; Chipi, E; Shan, D; Chiasserini, D; Parnetti, L"
Rofecoxib derivatives as NIR fluorescent probes for mitochondrial viscosity and in vivo imaging of Aβ plaques.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder for which the underlying causes remain largely unknown. Therefore, the development of imaging agents capable of detecting biomarkers associated with this disease is crucial. Dual-functional probes are particularly important as they can track two biomarkers at the same time and examine their interaction. Herein, Two red-emissive dual-functional fluorescent probes, RC-1 and RA-2, have been designed and synthesized based on the Rofecoxib scaffold. When probes (RC-1 and RA-2) are in viscous media or bound to Aβ aggregates, there is a dramatic enhancement in fluorescence emission due to the constraint of the twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect (TICT). RC-1 with ideal blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability enables visualization of Aβ plaques in vivo AD mice. These results suggest that RC-1 and RA-2 have the potential to serve as powerful fluorescence imaging agents for Aβ and mitochondria-related pathology in AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Beta-amyloid; Fluorescence imaging; Rofecoxib; Viscosity,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Brain; Fluorescent Dyes; Optical Imaging; Plaque, Amyloid; Viscosity","Anwar, G; Chen, D; Chen, Q; Xia, C; Yan, J"

Proteomic Network Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Cerebrospinal Fluid Reveals Alterations Associated with ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently defined at the research level by the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins in brain. While biofluid biomarkers are available to measure Aβ and tau pathology, few biomarkers are available to measure the complex pathophysiology that is associated with these two cardinal neuropathologies. Here we describe the proteomic landscape of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes associated with Aβ and tau pathology in 300 individuals as assessed by two different proteomic technologies-tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry and SomaScan. Harmonization and integration of both data types allowed for generation of a robust protein co-expression network consisting of 34 modules derived from 5242 protein measurements, including disease-relevant modules associated with autophagy, ubiquitination, endocytosis, and glycolysis.

Pathways linking pulse pressure to dementia in adults with Down syndrome.,"Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are less likely to have hypertension than neurotypical adults. However, whether blood pressure measures are associated with brain health and clinical outcomes in this population has not been studied in detail. Here, we assessed whether pulse pressure is associated with markers of cerebrovascular disease, entorhinal cortical atrophy, and diagnosis of dementia in adults with DS. Participants with DS from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome study (ADDS; n=195, age=50.6±7.2 years, 44% women, 18% diagnosed with dementia) were included. Higher pulse pressure was associated with greater global, parietal, and occipital WMH volume. Pulse pressure was not related to enlarged PVS, microbleeds, infarcts, entorhinal cortical thickness, or dementia diagnosis. However, in a serial mediation model, we found that pulse pressure was indirectly related to dementia diagnosis through parieto-occipital WMH and, subsequently through entorhinal cortical thickness. Higher pulse pressure may be a risk factor for dementia in people with DS by promoting cerebrovascular disease, which in turn affects neurodegeneration. Pulse pressure is an important determinant of brain health and clinical outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome despite the low likelihood of frank hypertension.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Down syndrome (DS); Pulse pressure; White matter hyperintensities (WMH); aging,,"Rizvi, B; Lao, PJ; Sathishkumar, M; Taylor, L; Queder, N; McMillan, L; Edwards, N; Keator, DB; Doran, E; Hom, C; Nguyen, D; Rosas, HD; Lai, F; Schupf, N; Gutierrez, J; Silverman, W; Lott, IT; Mapstone, M; Wilcock, DM; Head, E; Yassa, MA; Brickman, AM"
Novel brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a methylase blocks Alzheimer's disease proteopathology for precision medication.,"Current amyloid beta-targeting approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics only slow cognitive decline for small numbers of patients. This limited efficacy exists because AD is a multifactorial disease whose pathological mechanism(s) and diagnostic biomarkers are largely unknown. Here we report a new mechanism of AD pathogenesis in which the histone methyltransferase G9a noncanonically regulates translation of a hippocampal proteome that defines the proteopathic nature of AD. Accordingly, we developed a novel brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a, MS1262, across the blood-brain barrier to block this G9a-regulated, proteopathologic mechanism. Intermittent MS1262 treatment of multiple AD mouse models consistently restored both cognitive and noncognitive functions to healthy levels. Comparison of proteomic/phosphoproteomic analyses of MS1262-treated AD mice with human AD patient data identified multiple pathological brain pathways that elaborate amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles as well as blood coagulation, from which biomarkers of early stage of AD including SMOC1 were found to be affected by MS1262 treatment. Notably, these results indicated that MS1262 treatment may reduce or avoid the risk of blood clot burst for brain bleeding or a stroke. This mouse-to-human conservation of G9a-translated AD proteopathology suggests that the global, multifaceted effects of MS1262 in mice could extend to relieve all symptoms of AD patients with minimum side effect. In addition, our mechanistically derived biomarkers can be used for stage-specific AD diagnosis and companion diagnosis of individualized drug effects.",2023,,,"Xie, L; Sheehy, RN; Xiong, Y; Muneer, A; Wrobel, JA; Park, KS; Velez, J; Liu, J; Luo, YJ; Li, YD; Quintanilla, L; Li, Y; Xu, C; Deshmukh, M; Wen, Z; Jin, J; Song, J; Chen, X"

In this Review, we examine the roles of large and small vessel disease in VCID, considering the underlying pathophysiological processes that lead to vascular brain injury, including atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, ischaemic injury, haemorrhage, hypoperfusion, endothelial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier breakdown, inflammation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and neuronal and glial degeneration.

Innovative SALDI mass spectrometry analysis for Alzheimer's disease synthetic peptides detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is nowadays the prominent cause of senile dementia. This pathology is characterized by aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles in cells and by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Noteworthy, a phosphorylated protein (tau protein) and a peptide presenting two overlapping sequences of 40 or 42 residues named β-amyloid peptides 1-40 (Aβ 1-40) and 1-42 (Aβ 1-42), respectively, were related to such deleterious phenomena. Singularly, the neurotoxicity was primarily attributed to the amyloid peptide Aβ 1-42 form due to its capacity to fold into beta-sheets rendering it insoluble thus causing subsequent aggregation and accumulation in vivo. Regarding AD diagnosis relying on mass spectrometry, Aβ 1-42 and/or Aβ 1-40 were considered as relevant biomarkers being measured in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), blood and urine. Under that context, we aimed at implementing an innovative method to evidence the depletion of circulating Aβ 1-42 amyloid peptide compared to the shorter Aβ 1-40 form indicating a pathologic state. We investigated Surface-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SALDI-MS) in order to monitor the Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 ratio without any prior sample treatment or enrichment. Taking into account that β-amyloid peptide and 1-42 can aggregate into beta-sheets depending on the experimental conditions, specific attention was devoted to sample integrity monitoring performed by circular dichroism experiments during SALDI-MS method development.",2024,CD; Imaging MS; Nanoneedles; Nanowires; SALDI-MS; β-Amyloid peptides,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Plaque, Amyloid; Biomarkers","Cournut, A; Moustiez, P; Coffinier, Y; Enjalbal, C; Bich, C"

Peptide-based approaches to directly target alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease.,"Peptides and their mimetics are increasingly recognised as drug-like molecules, particularly for intracellular protein-protein interactions too large for inhibition by small molecules, and inaccessible to larger biologics. In the past two decades, evidence associating the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein strongly implicates this protein in disease onset and progression of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. The subsequent formation of toxic, intracellular, Lewy body deposits, in which alpha-synuclein is a major component, is a key diagnostic hallmark of the disease. To reach their therapeutic site of action, peptides must both cross the blood-brain barrier and enter dopaminergic neurons to prevent the formation of these intracellular inclusions. In this review, we describe and summarise the current efforts made in the development of peptides and their mimetics to directly engage with alpha-synuclein with the intention of modulating aggregation, and importantly, toxicity. This is a rapidly expanding field with great socioeconomic impact; these molecules harbour significant promise as therapeutics, or as early biomarkers during prodromal disease stages, or both. As these are age-dependent conditions, an increasing global life expectancy means disease prevalence is rising. No current treatments exist to either prevent or slow disease progression. It is therefore crucial that drugs are developed for these conditions before health care and social care capacities become overrun.",2023,Alpha-Synuclein; Parkinson’s Disease; Peptide therapeutics; Peptidomimetics; Synucleinopathies,Humans; Parkinson Disease; alpha-Synuclein; Synucleinopathies; Inclusion Bodies; Peptides,"Allen, SG; Meade, RM; White Stenner, LL; Mason, JM"

Identifying Sex-Specific Serum Patterns of Alzheimer's Mice through Deep TMT Profiling and a Concentration-Dependent Concatenation Strategy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, disproportionately affecting women in disease prevalence and progression. Comprehensive analysis of the serum proteome in a common AD mouse model offers potential in identifying possible AD pathology- and gender-associated biomarkers. Here, we introduce a multiplexed, nondepleted mouse serum proteome profiling via tandem mass-tag (TMTpro) labeling. The labeled sample was separated into 475 fractions using basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), which were categorized into low-, medium-, and high-concentration fractions for concatenation. This concentration-dependent concatenation strategy resulted in 128 fractions for acidic RPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, collecting ∼5 million MS/MS scans and identifying 3972 unique proteins (3413 genes) that cover a dynamic range spanning at least 6 orders of magnitude. The differential expression analysis between wild type and the commonly used AD model (5xFAD) mice exhibited minimal significant protein alterations. However, we detected 60 statistically significant (FDR < 0.05), sex-specific proteins, including complement components, serpins, carboxylesterases, major urinary proteins, cysteine-rich secretory protein 1, pregnancy-associated murine protein 1, prolactin, amyloid P component, epidermal growth factor receptor, fibrinogen-like protein 1, and hepcidin.

Neuroinflammation increases oxygen extraction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuroinflammation, impaired metabolism, and hypoperfusion are fundamental pathological hallmarks of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous studies have asserted a close association between neuroinflammation and disrupted cerebral energetics. During AD progression and other neurodegenerative disorders, a persistent state of chronic neuroinflammation reportedly exacerbates cytotoxicity and potentiates neuronal death. Here, we assessed the impact of a neuroinflammatory challenge on metabolic demand and microvascular hemodynamics in the somatosensory cortex of an AD mouse model. We utilized in vivo 2-photon microscopy and the phosphorescent oxygen sensor Oxyphor 2P to measure partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and capillary red blood cell flux in cortical microvessels of awake mice. Intravascular pO2 and capillary RBC flux measurements were performed in 8-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and wildtype littermates on days 0, 7, and 14 of a 14-day period of lipopolysaccaride-induced neuroinflammation. Before the induced inflammatory challenge, AD mice demonstrated reduced metabolic demand but similar capillary red blood cell flux as their wild type counterparts. Neuroinflammation provoked significant reductions in cerebral intravascular oxygen levels and elevated oxygen extraction in both animal groups, without significantly altering red blood cell flux in capillaries. This study provides evidence that neuroinflammation alters cerebral oxygen demand at the early stages of AD without substantially altering vascular oxygen supply. The results will guide our understanding of neuroinflammation's influence on neuroimaging biomarkers for early AD diagnosis.",2023,,,"Liu, C; Cardenas-Rivera, A; Teitelbaum, S; Birmingham, A; Alfadhel, M; Yaseen, MA"

Peripheral Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of YKL-40 in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is particularly complicated, and early diagnosis and course monitoring of the disease are not ideal based on the available core biomarkers. As a biomarker closely related to neuroinflammation, YKL-40 provides a potential scalable approach in AD, but its association remains controversial and inconclusive with AD. We conducted this study to assess the utility of YKL-40 levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) by meta-analysis. We systematically searched and screened relevant trials for comparing YKL-40 levels between AD patients and HCs in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a search deadline of 14 March 2023 for each database. A total of 17 eligible and relevant studies involving 1811 subjects, including 949 AD patients and 862 HCs, were included. The results showed that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral blood of AD patients and HCs did not possess significant differences.

Chronic kidney disease causes blood-brain barrier breakdown via urea-activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 and insolubility of tau protein.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes cognitive impairment and contributes to the overall global burden of dementia. However, mechanisms through which the kidneys and brain communicate are not fully understood. We established a CKD mouse model through adenine-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Novel object recognition tests indicated that CKD decreased recognition memory. Sarkosyl-insoluble-proteomic analyses of the CKD mouse hippocampus revealed an accumulation of insoluble MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) and RNA-binding proteins such as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1 subunit 70 (SNRNP70). Additionally, there was an accumulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. We identified that expressions of essential tight-junction protein claudin-5 and adherens-junction protein platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) were decreased in the brain endothelial cells of CKD mice. We determined urea as a major uremic solute that dose dependently decreased both claudin-5 and PECAM-1 expression in the mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 cells. Gelatin zymography indicated that the serum of CKD mice activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), while marimastat ameliorated the reduction of claudin-5 expression by urea in bEnd.3 cells. This study established a brain proteomic signature of CKD indicating BBB breakdown and insolubility of tau protein, which are pathologically linked to Alzheimer's disease. Urea-mediated activation of MMP2 was partly responsible for BBB breakdown in CKD.",2023,blood brain barrier; chronic kidney disease; cognitive impairment; proteomics; urea,"Animals; Mice; Blood-Brain Barrier; Claudin-5; Endothelial Cells; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Proteomics; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; tau Proteins","Matsuki, H; Mandai, S; Shiwaku, H; Koide, T; Takahashi, N; Yanagi, T; Inaba, S; Ida, S; Fujiki, T; Mori, Y; Ando, F; Mori, T; Susa, K; Iimori, S; Sohara, E; Takahashi, H; Uchida, S"

Associations Between Blood Nutritional Biomarkers and Cerebral Amyloid-β: Insights From the COGFRAIL Cohort Study.,"Understanding the relationship between blood nutrients and neurodegeneration could contribute to devising strategies for preventing Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the associations between fatty acids, vitamins D, B6, B12, folate, homocysteine, and the cerebral load of amyloid β (Aβ). This cross-sectional study included 177 older adults (70-96 years, 65% female) with objective cognitive impairment, prefrail, or frail. Cerebral Aβ load was determined using positron emission tomography Standardized Uptake Value ratios. Fatty acids were assessed in erythrocytes, vitamins D and homocysteine in serum, and the other vitamins in plasma. Linear regression models corrected for multiple comparisons evaluated the associations between each nutrient and Aβ. The principal component factor followed by linear regression grouped the fatty acids strongly correlated (factor) and associated with Aβ. Higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): clupanodonic acid (22:5n-3; β: -0.13; p = .001), mead acid (20:3n-9; β: -0.07; p = .036), and adrenic acid (22:4n-6; β: -0.05; p = .031) were associated with lower global Aβ load, whereas linoleic acid (18:2n-6) was associated with higher global Aβ load (β: 0.18; p = .042). Clupanodonic acid was inversely associated with Aβ in all cerebral regions except the thalamus. The factor composed of mead, clupanodonic, and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids was associated with a lower global Aβ load (β: -0.02; p = .002). Some erythrocyte PUFAs were inversely associated with Aβ load in the brain, and most of them were metabolites of the essential fatty acids linoleic and α-linolenic. Given the cross-sectional design, these results must be carefully interpreted, and longitudinal studies are needed.",2024,Fatty acids; Neurodegeneration; Vitamins,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fatty Acids; Homocysteine; Positron-Emission Tomography; Vitamins,"Grande de França, NA; Díaz, G; Lengelé, L; Soriano, G; Caspar-Bauguil, S; Saint-Aubert, L; Payoux, P; Rouch, L; Vellas, B; de Souto Barreto, P; Sourdet, S"
Blood Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The characteristic pathological manifestation of AD includes the deposition of extracellular insoluble β amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed from hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Cost effective and minimally invasive peripheral blood-based biomarkers are critical for early AD diagnosis. Currently, the plasma based two fraction of β amyloid peptide ratio (Aβ42/40) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are considered as blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Recent research indicates that oxidative stress (OS) occurs prior to amyloid plaque (Aβ) formation and abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD. The imbalance of the master antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), and prooxidants (iron, zinc, and copper)─plays a crucial role in AD neurodegeneration. We present peripheral blood-based OS related biomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the disease process and may serve as a novel screening tool for early detection of AD onset. This OS based approach may also provide a quick and cost efficient method to monitor the effects of disease-modifying therapies in AD clinical trials.",2023,"Alzheimer’s disease; antioxidants; biomarker; glutathione; oxidative stress; peripheral blood; prooxidants, iron",Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Biomarkers,"Mandal, PK; Maroon, JC; Garg, A; Arora, NK; Bansal, R; Kaushik, A; Samkaria, A; Kumaran, G; Arora, Y"

Blood samples of 36 subjects presenting with cognitive decline to the neurology OPDs of Dow and Civil hospitals, Karachi, were centrifuged, and plasma was stored at -80℃. Before analysis, it was thawed at 4℃ and protein levels were measured through ELISA. Two-thirds of the patients were females but age distribution across both the groups was not significantly different (p=0.21). No difference was observed in the mean plasma concentrations of Aβ42, P-Tau, and NFL between the two groups (p-values 0.78 and 0.27 and 0.09 respectively).

We therefore tested the performance of these plasma biomarkers in 126 participants with preclinical AD and 123 controls with 8-10 years of follow-up from the China Cognition and Aging Study. Plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL were significantly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid counterparts and significantly altered in participants with preclinical AD. Combining plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL successfully discriminated preclinical AD from controls. These findings were validated in a replication cohort including 51 familial AD mutation carriers and 52 non-carriers from the Chinese Familial Alzheimer's Disease Network.

SGLT2 and DPP4 inhibitors improve Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and cognitive function through distinct mechanisms in a T2D-AD mouse model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) share common features, including insulin resistance. Brain insulin resistance has been implicated as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-diabetic drugs sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2-i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4-i) improve insulin sensitivity and provide neuroprotection. However, the effects of these two inhibitors on the brain metabolism and insulin resistance remain uninvestigated. We developed a T2D-AD mouse model using a high-fat diet (HFD) for 19 weeks along with a single dose of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at the fourth week of HFD initiation. Subsequently, the animals were treated with SGLT2-i (empagliflozin, 25 mg/kg/day orally [p.o.]) and DPP4-i (sitagliptin, 100 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 7 weeks. Subsequently, behavioral tests were performed, and the expression of insulin signaling, AD-related, and other signaling pathway proteins in the brain were examined. T2D-AD mice not only showed increased blood glucose levels and body weight but also insulin resistance. SGLT2-i and DPP4-i effectively ameliorated insulin sensitivity and reduced body weight in these mice. Furthermore, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i significantly improved hippocampal-dependent learning, memory, and cognitive functions in the T2D-AD mouse model. Interestingly, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i reduced the hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) levels and amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation and enhanced brain insulin signaling. SGLT2-i reduced pTau accumulation through the angiotensin converting enzyme-2/angiotensin (1-7)/ mitochondrial assembly receptor axis, whereas DPP4-i reduced Aβ accumulation by increasing insulin-degrading enzyme levels. These findings suggest that SGLT2-i and DPP4-i prevent AD-like pathology and cognitive dysfunction in T2D mice potentially through affecting brain insulin signaling via different mechanisms.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid β; Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor; Hyperphosphorylated tau; Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Mice; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Alzheimer Disease; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Insulin Resistance; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Cognition; Disease Models, Animal; Body Weight","Sim, AY; Choi, DH; Kim, JY; Kim, ER; Goh, AR; Lee, YH; Lee, JE"

Stimulation of TREM2 with agonistic antibodies-an emerging therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are associated with microgliosis. Microglia have long been considered to have detrimental roles in Alzheimer's disease. However, functional analyses of genes encoding risk factors that are linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and that are enriched or exclusively expressed in microglia, have revealed unexpected protective functions. One of the major risk genes for Alzheimer's disease is TREM2. Risk variants of TREM2 are loss-of-function mutations affecting chemotaxis, phagocytosis, lipid and energy metabolism, and survival and proliferation. Agonistic anti-TREM2 antibodies have been developed to boost these protective functions in patients with intact TREM2 alleles. Several anti-TREM2 antibodies are in early clinical trials, and current efforts aim to achieve more efficient transport of these antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. PET imaging could be used to monitor target engagement. Data from animal models, and biomarker studies in patients, further support a rationale for boosting TREM2 functions during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease.",2023,,"Animals; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Microglia; Mutation; Antibodies; Disease Models, Animal; Membrane Glycoproteins; Receptors, Immunologic","Schlepckow, K; Morenas-Rodríguez, E; Hong, S; Haass, C"

Phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease.,"There is a need for blood biomarkers to detect individuals at different Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages because obtaining cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers is invasive and costly. Plasma phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau) have shown potential as such biomarkers. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), threonine 217 (p-tau217) and threonine 231 (p-tau231) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. All p-tau isoforms increase as a function of Aβ-accumulation and discriminate healthy individuals from those at preclinical AD stages with high accuracy. P-tau231 increases earliest, followed by p-tau181 and p-tau217. In advanced stages, all p-tau isoforms are associated with the clinical classification of AD and increase with disease severity, with the greatest increase seen for p-tau217. This is also reflected by a better correlation of p-tau217 with Aβ scans, whereas both, p-tau217 and p-tau181 correlated equally with tau scans. However, at the very advanced stages, p-tau181 begins to plateau, which may mirror the trajectory of the Aβ pathology and indicate an association with a more intermediate risk of AD. Across the AD continuum, the incremental increase in all biomarkers is associated with structural changes in widespread brain regions and underlying cognitive decline. Furthermore, all isoforms differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, making them specific for AD. Incorporating p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in clinical use requires further studies to examine ideal cut-points and harmonize assays.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; P-tau181; P-tau217; P-tau231; Phosphorylated tau; Plasma,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Protein Isoforms; tau Proteins; Threonine,"Telser, J; Grossmann, K; Wohlwend, N; Risch, L; Saely, CH; Werner, P"

Accelerating Alzheimer's therapeutic development: The past and future of clinical trials.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has entered a new era with the recent positive phase 3 clinical trials of the anti-Aβ antibodies lecanemab and donanemab. Why did it take 30 years to achieve these successes? Developing potent therapies for reducing fibrillar amyloid was key, as was selection of patients at relatively early stages of disease. Biomarkers of the target pathologies, including amyloid and tau PET, and insights from past trials were also critical to the recent successes. Moving forward, the challenge will be to develop more efficacious therapies with greater efficiency. Novel trial designs, including combination therapies and umbrella and basket protocols, will accelerate clinical development. Better diversity and inclusivity of trial participants are needed, and blood-based biomarkers may help to improve access for medically underserved groups.

Considerations for Use of Blood-Based Biomarkers in Epidemiologic Dementia Research.,"Dementia represents a growing public health burden with large social, racial, and ethnic disparities. The etiology of dementia is poorly understood, and the lack of robust biomarkers in diverse, population-representative samples is a barrier to moving dementia research forward. Existing biomarkers and other measures of pathology-derived from neuropathology, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid samples-are commonly collected from predominantly White and highly educated samples drawn from academic medical centers in urban settings. Blood-based biomarkers are noninvasive and less expensive, offering promise to expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of dementia, including in participants from historically excluded groups. Although largely not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration or used in clinical settings, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly included in epidemiologic studies on dementia. Blood-based biomarkers in epidemiologic research may allow the field to more accurately understand the multifactorial etiology and sequence of events that characterize dementia-related pathophysiological changes. As blood-based dementia biomarkers continue to be developed and incorporated into research and practice, we outline considerations for using them in dementia epidemiology, and illustrate key concepts with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (2003-present) data. We focus on measurement, including both validity and reliability, and on the use of dementia blood-based biomarkers to promote equity in dementia research and cognitive aging.

However, NDEVs comprise only a minor fraction of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs). Most published studies have leveraged the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) for NDEV immunocapture.

Amyloid deposition and small vessel disease are associated with cognitive function in older adults with type 2 diabetes.,"Diabetes is associated with cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are complex and their relationship with Alzheimer's Disease biomarkers is not fully understood. We assessed the association of small vessel disease (SVD) and amyloid burden with cognitive functioning in 47 non-demented older adults with type-2 diabetes from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study (mean age 78Y, 64% females). FLAIR-MRI, Vizamyl amyloid-PET, and T1W-MRI quantified white matter hyperintensities as a measure of SVD, amyloid burden, and gray matter (GM) volume, respectively. Mean hemoglobin A1c levels and duration of type-2 diabetes were used as measures of diabetic control. Cholesterol level and blood pressure were used as measures of cardiovascular risk. A broad neuropsychological battery assessed cognition. Linear regression models revealed that both higher SVD and amyloid burden were associated with lower cognitive functioning. Additional adjustments for type-2 diabetes-related characteristics, GM volume, and cardiovascular risk did not alter the results. The association of amyloid with cognition remained unchanged after further adjustment for SVD. Our findings suggest that SVD and amyloid pathology may independently contribute to lower cognitive functioning in non-demented older adults with type-2 diabetes, supporting a multimodal approach for diagnosing, preventing, and treating cognitive decline in this population.",2023,,,"Lesman-Segev, OH; Golan, S; Springer, RR; Livny, A; Lin, HM; Yuxia, O; Zadok, M; Ganmore, I; Heymann, A; Hoffmann, C; Domachevsky, L; Beeri, MS"
Systematic review: fluid biomarkers and machine learning methods to improve the diagnosis from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered an early stage of dementia, with estimated rates of progression to dementia up to 80-90% after approximately 6 years from the initial diagnosis. Diagnosis of cognitive impairment in dementia is typically based on clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessments, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The main goal of diagnosing MCI is to determine its cause, particularly whether it is due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, only a limited percentage of the population has access to etiological confirmation, which has led to the emergence of peripheral fluid biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for dementias, including MCI due to AD. Recent advances in biofluid assays have enabled the use of sophisticated statistical models and multimodal machine learning (ML) algorithms for the diagnosis of MCI based on fluid biomarkers from CSF, peripheral blood, and saliva, among others. This approach has shown promise for identifying specific causes of MCI, including AD. After a PRISMA analysis, 29 articles revealed a trend towards using multimodal algorithms that incorporate additional biomarkers such as neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and genetic information. Particularly, neuroimaging is commonly used in conjunction with fluid biomarkers for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our systematic review suggests that cost-effective longitudinal multimodal monitoring data, representative of diverse cultural populations and utilizing white-box ML algorithms, could be a valuable contribution to the development of diagnostic models for AD due to MCI. Clinical assessment and biomarkers, together with ML techniques, could prove pivotal in improving diagnostic tools for MCI due to AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Fluid biomarker; Machine learning; Mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Machine Learning; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Blanco, K; Salcidua, S; Orellana, P; Sauma-Pérez, T; León, T; Steinmetz, LCL; Ibañez, A; Duran-Aniotz, C; de la Cruz, R"
Blood-Based Transcriptomic Biomarkers Are Predictive of Neurodegeneration Rather Than Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global health crisis affecting millions and incurring substantial economic costs. However, clinical diagnosis remains challenging, with misdiagnoses and underdiagnoses being prevalent. There is an increased focus on putative, blood-based biomarkers that may be useful for the diagnosis as well as early detection of AD. In the present study, we used an unbiased combination of machine learning and functional network analyses to identify blood gene biomarker candidates in AD. Using supervised machine learning, we also determined whether these candidates were indeed unique to AD or whether they were indicative of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our analyses showed that genes involved in spliceosome assembly, RNA binding, transcription, protein synthesis, mitoribosomes, and NADH dehydrogenase were the best-performing genes for identifying AD patients relative to cognitively healthy controls. This transcriptomic signature, however, was not unique to AD, and subsequent machine learning showed that this signature could also predict PD and ALS relative to controls without neurodegenerative disease. Combined, our results suggest that mRNA from whole blood can indeed be used to screen for patients with neurodegeneration but may be less effective in diagnosing the specific neurodegenerative disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; blood; machine learning; neurodegenerative diseases; transcriptomics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Transcriptome; Parkinson Disease; Biomarkers,"Shvetcov, A; Thomson, S; Spathos, J; Cho, AN; Wilkins, HM; Andrews, SJ; Delerue, F; Couttas, TA; Issar, JK; Isik, F; Kaur, S; Drummond, E; Dobson-Stone, C; Duffy, SL; Rogers, NM; Catchpoole, D; Gold, WA; Swerdlow, RH; Brown, DA; Finney, CA"
The Role of Adipokines in the Pathologies of the Central Nervous System.,"Adipokines are protein hormones secreted by adipose tissue in response to disruptions in physiological homeostasis within the body's systems. The regulatory functions of adipokines within the central nervous system (CNS) are multifaceted and intricate, and they have been identified in a number of pathologies. Therefore, specific adipokines have the potential to be used as biomarkers for screening purposes in neurological dysfunctions. The systematic review presented herein focuses on the analysis of the functions of various adipokines in the pathogenesis of CNS diseases. Thirteen proteins were selected for analysis through scientific databases. It was found that these proteins can be identified within the cerebrospinal fluid either by their ability to modify their molecular complex and cross the blood-brain barrier or by being endogenously produced within the CNS itself. As a result, this can correlate with their measurability during pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, depression, or brain tumors.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; adipokines; adipose tissue; depression; encephalitis; meningitis; multiple sclerosis; neurological dysfunctions; protein hormones,Humans; Adipokines; Central Nervous System; Alzheimer Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Adipose Tissue,"Huber, K; Szerenos, E; Lewandowski, D; Toczylowski, K; Sulik, A"

Therapeutic efficacy and promise of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease and other aging-related disorders.,"The term extracellular vesicles (EVs) refers to a variety of heterogeneous nanovesicles secreted by almost all cell types, primarily for intercellular communication and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The role of EVs has been widely reported in the genesis and progression of multiple pathological conditions, and these vesicles are suggested to serve as 'liquid biopsies'. In addition to their use as biomarkers, EVs secreted by specific cell types, especially with stem cell properties, have shown promise as cell-free nanotherapeutics. Stem cell-derived EVs (SC-EVs) have been increasingly used as an attractive alternative to stem cell therapies and have been reported to promote regeneration of aging-associated tissue loss and function. SC-EVs treatment ameliorates brain and peripheral aging, reproductive dysfunctions and inhibits cellular senescence, thereby reversing several aging-related disorders and dysfunctions. The anti-aging therapeutic potential of SC-EVs depends on multiple factors, including the type of stem cells, the age of the source stem cells, and their physiological state. In this review, we briefly describe studies related to the promising effects of SC-EVs against various aging-related pathologies, and then we focus in-depth on the therapeutic benefits of SC-EVs against Alzheimer's disease, one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases in elderly individuals. Numerous studies in transgenic mouse models have reported the usefulness of SC-EVs in targeting the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation, leading to improved neuronal protection, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive measures. Cell culture studies have further identified the underlying molecular mechanisms through which SC-EVs reduce amyloid beta (Aβ) levels or shift microglia phenotype from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory state. Interestingly, multiple routes of administration, including nasal delivery, have confirmed that SC-EVs could cross the blood-brain barrier. Due to this, SC-EVs have also been tested to deliver specific therapeutic cargo molecule/s (e.g., neprilysin) to the brain. Despite these promises, several challenges related to quality control, scalability, and biodistribution remain, hindering the realization of the vast clinical promise of SC-EVs.",2023,Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; Extracellular vesicles; Mesenchymal stem cell; Stem cell,Mice; Animals; Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Tissue Distribution; Extracellular Vesicles; Stem Cells,"Rather, HA; Almousa, S; Craft, S; Deep, G"

A significant opportunity for therapies that can slow the course of the disease exists during this early detection stage. Additionally, these cutting-edge techniques improve diagnostic precision, objectivity, and accessibility. Liquid biopsies and blood-based biomarkers provide non-invasive alternatives, filling accessibility gaps in diagnosis. While issues with standardisation, ethics, and data integration continue, collaboration within research, clinical practice, and policy realms fuels positive developments.

Studies have shown that neurogenic exosomes in the blood can be effectively used as biomarkers for AD.,2023,Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; Blood; Exosome,,"Zhang, X; Liu, H; Huang, Y; Wang, R"
Influence of cerebral blood flow on volumetric loss related to Alzheimer's disease.,"CBF measured with Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may become an important biomarker by showing changes in early stages of AD, such as in the prodromal stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).",2023,Alzheimer Disease; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,,"Agnollitto, MISS; Leoni, RF; Foss, MP; Palaretti, J; Cayres, M; Pansarim, V; Nather, JC; Zotin, MCZ; Ferrioli, E; Lima, NK; Dos Santos, AC; Moriguti, JC"
Mosaic loss of the Y chromosome in human neurodegenerative and oncological diseases.,"The development of new biomarkers for prediction and early detection of human diseases, as well as for monitoring the response to therapy is one of the most relevant areas of modern human genetics and genomics. Until recently, it was believed that the function of human Y chromosome genes was limited to determining sex and controlling spermatogenesis. Thanks to occurance of large databases of the genome-wide association study (GWAS), there has been a transition to the use of large samples for analyzing genetic changes in both normal and pathological conditions. This has made it possible to assess the association of mosaic aneuploidy of the Y chromosome in somatic cells with a shorter lifespan in men compared to women. Based on data from the UK Biobank, an association was found between mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in peripheral blood leukocytes and the age of men over 70, as well as a number of oncological, cardiac, metabolic, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric diseases. As a result, mLOY in peripheral blood cells has been considered a potential marker of biological age in men and as a marker of certain age-related diseases. Currently, numerous associations have been identified between mLOY and genes based on GWAS and transcriptomes in affected tissues. However, the exact cause of mLOY and the impact and consequences of this phenomenon at the whole organism level have not been established. In particular, it is unclear whether aneuploidy of the Y chromosome in blood cells may affect the development of pathologies that manifest in other organs, such as the brain in Alzheimer's disease, or whether it is a neutral biomarker of general genomic instability. This review examines the main pathologies and genetic factors associated with mLOY, as well as the hypotheses regarding their interplay. Special attention is given to recent studies on mLOY in brain cells in Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; GWAS; age-related diseases; mosaic loss of Y chromosome (mLOY); oncological diseases,,"Kuznetsova, IL; Uralsky, LI; Tyazhelova, TV; Andreeva, TV; Rogaev, EI"
The Underestimated Relevance of Alzheimer's Disease Copathology in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology can be observed in approximately 10-15% of cases with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS-AD patients have a higher prevalence of amnestic cognitive disturbances, which may often precede motor symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD core biomarkers usually show no or slightly significant changes in ALS, whereas blood phosphorylated tau protein might be increased independently from AD copathology. Neurofilament proteins are consistently elevated in CSF and blood of ALS, but have been poorly investigated in ALS-AD. All these issues should be taken into account when using fluid biomarkers as inclusion criteria or secondary endpoints in clinical trials.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; biomarker; copathology; neurofilament light chain,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; tau Proteins; Neurofilament Proteins; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Barba, L; Otto, M; Abu-Rumeileh, S"

No phenotypic or genotypic evidence for a link between sleep duration and brain atrophy.,"Short sleep is held to cause poorer brain health, but is short sleep associated with higher rates of brain structural decline? Analysing 8,153 longitudinal MRIs from 3,893 healthy adults, we found no evidence for an association between sleep duration and brain atrophy. In contrast, cross-sectional analyses (51,295 observations) showed inverse U-shaped relationships, where a duration of 6.5 (95% confidence interval, (5.7, 7.3)) hours was associated with the thickest cortex and largest volumes relative to intracranial volume. This fits converging evidence from research on mortality, health and cognition that points to roughly seven hours being associated with good health. Genome-wide association analyses suggested that genes associated with longer sleep for below-average sleepers were linked to shorter sleep for above-average sleepers. Mendelian randomization did not yield evidence for causal impacts of sleep on brain structure. The combined results challenge the notion that habitual short sleep causes brain atrophy, suggesting that normal brains promote adequate sleep duration-which is shorter than current recommendations.",2023,,Adult; Humans; Sleep Duration; Cross-Sectional Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Brain; Sleep Wake Disorders; Atrophy,"Fjell, AM; Sørensen, Ø; Wang, Y; Amlien, IK; Baaré, WFC; Bartrés-Faz, D; Bertram, L; Boraxbekk, CJ; Brandmaier, AM; Demuth, I; Drevon, CA; Ebmeier, KP; Ghisletta, P; Kievit, R; Kühn, S; Madsen, KS; Mowinckel, AM; Nyberg, L; Sexton, CE; Solé-Padullés, C; Vidal-Piñeiro, D; Wagner, G; Watne, LO; Walhovd, KB"

A new perspective on Alzheimer's disease: microRNAs and circular RNAs.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) play a multifaceted role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). miRNAs regulate several aspects of the disease, such as Aβ metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic function. The dynamic interaction between miRNAs and their target genes depends upon various factors, including the subcellular localization of miRNAs, the relative abundance of miRNAs and target mRNAs, and the affinity of miRNA-mRNA interactions. The miRNAs are released into extracellular fluids and subsequently conveyed to specific target cells through various modes of transportation, such as exosomes. In comparison, circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNA (ncRNA) characterized by their covalently closed continuous loops. In contrast to linear RNA, RNA molecules are circularized by forming covalent bonds between the 3'and 5'ends. CircRNA regulates gene expression through interaction with miRNAs at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, even though their precise functions and mechanisms of gene regulation remain to be elucidated. The current stage of research on miRNA expression profiles for diagnostic purposes in complex disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is still in its early phase, primarily due to the intricate nature of the underlying pathological causes, which encompass a diverse range of pathways and targets. Hence, this review comprehensively addressed the alteration of miRNA expression across diverse sources such as peripheral blood, exosome, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain in AD patients. This review also addresses the nascent involvement of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD and their prospective utility as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for these conditions in future research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; circular RNA; microRNA; neurodegenerative disease,,"Abidin, SZ; Mat Pauzi, NA; Mansor, NI; Mohd Isa, NI; Hamid, AA"
Establishing an online resource to facilitate global collaboration and inclusion of underrepresented populations: Experience from the MJFF Global Genetic Parkinson's Disease Project.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, currently affecting ~7 million people worldwide. PD is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with at least 10% of all cases explained by a monogenic cause or strong genetic risk factor. However, the vast majority of our present data on monogenic PD is based on the investigation of patients of European White ancestry, leaving a large knowledge gap on monogenic PD in underrepresented populations. Gene-targeted therapies are being developed at a fast pace and have started entering clinical trials. In light of these developments, building a global network of centers working on monogenic PD, fostering collaborative research, and establishing a clinical trial-ready cohort is imperative. Based on a systematic review of the English literature on monogenic PD and a successful team science approach, we have built up a network of 59 sites worldwide and have collected information on the availability of data, biomaterials, and facilities. To enable access to this resource and to foster collaboration across centers, as well as between academia and industry, we have developed an interactive map and online tool allowing for a quick overview of available resources, along with an option to filter for specific items of interest. This initiative is currently being merged with the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2), which will attract additional centers with a focus on underrepresented sites. This growing resource and tool will facilitate collaborative research and impact the development and testing of new therapies for monogenic and potentially for idiopathic PD patients.",2023,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Palliative Care,"Vollstedt, EJ; Madoev, H; Aasly, A; Ahmad-Annuar, A; Al-Mubarak, B; Alcalay, RN; Alvarez, V; Amorin, I; Annesi, G; Arkadir, D; Bardien, S; Barker, RA; Barkhuizen, M; Basak, AN; Bonifati, V; Boon, A; Brighina, L; Brockmann, K; Carmine Belin, A; Carr, J; Clarimon, J; Cornejo-Olivas, M; Correia Guedes, L; Corvol, JC; Crosiers, D; Damásio, J; Das, P; de Carvalho Aguiar, P; De Rosa, A; Dorszewska, J; Ertan, S; Ferese, R; Ferreira, J; Gatto, E; Genç, G; Giladi, N; Gómez-Garre, P; Hanagasi, H; Hattori, N; Hentati, F; Hoffman-Zacharska, D; Illarioshkin, SN; Jankovic, J; Jesús, S; Kaasinen, V; Kievit, A; Klivenyi, P; Kostic, V; Koziorowski, D; Kühn, AA; Lang, AE; Lim, SY; Lin, CH; Lohmann, K; Markovic, V; Martikainen, MH; Mellick, G; Merello, M; Milanowski, L; Mir, P; Öztop-Çakmak, Ö; Pimentel, MMG; Pulkes, T; Puschmann, A; Rogaeva, E; Sammler, EM; Skaalum Petersen, M; Skorvanek, M; Spitz, M; Suchowersky, O; Tan, AH; Termsarasab, P; Thaler, A; Tumas, V; Valente, EM; van de Warrenburg, B; Williams-Gray, CH; Wu, RM; Zhang, B; Zimprich, A; Solle, J; Padmanabhan, S; Klein, C"
"Longitudinal associations of serum biomarkers with early cognitive, amyloid and grey matter changes.","Blood-based biomarkers have been extensively evaluated for their diagnostic potential in Alzheimer's disease. However, their relative prognostic and monitoring capabilities for cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and grey matter loss in cognitively unimpaired elderly require further investigation over extended time periods. This prospective cohort study in cognitively unimpaired elderly [n = 185, mean age (range) = 69 (53-84) years, 48% female] examined the prognostic and monitoring capabilities of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and phosphorylated tau (pTau)181 through their quantification in serum. All participants underwent baseline Aβ-PET, MRI and blood sampling as well as 2-yearly cognitive testing. A subset additionally underwent Aβ-PET (n = 109), MRI (n = 106) and blood sampling (n = 110) during follow-up [median time interval (range) = 6.1 (1.3-11.0) years]. Matching plasma measurements were available for Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and pTau181 (both n = 140). Linear mixed-effects models showed that high serum GFAP and NfL predicted future cognitive decline in memory (βGFAP×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.007 and βNfL×Time = -0.031, PFDR = 0.002) and language (βGFAP×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.002 and βNfL×Time = -0.018, PFDR = 0.03) domains. Low serum Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 equally but independently predicted memory decline (βAβ1-42/Aβ1-40×Time = -0.024, PFDR = 0.02). Whole-brain voxelwise analyses revealed that low Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 predicted Aβ accumulation within the precuneus and frontal regions, high GFAP and NfL predicted grey matter loss within hippocampal regions and low Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 predicted grey matter loss in lateral temporal regions. Serum GFAP, NfL and pTau181 increased over time, while Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 decreased only in Aβ-PET-negative elderly. NfL increases associated with declining memory (βNfLchange×Time = -0.030, PFDR = 0.006) and language (βNfLchange×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.02) function and serum Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 decreases associated with declining language function (βAβ1-42/Aβ1-40×Time = -0.020, PFDR = 0.04). GFAP increases associated with Aβ accumulation within the precuneus and NfL increases associated with grey matter loss. Baseline and longitudinal serum pTau181 only associated with Aβ accumulation in restricted occipital regions. In head-to-head comparisons, serum outperformed plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 (ΔAUC = 0.10, PDeLong, FDR = 0.04), while both plasma and serum pTau181 demonstrated poor performance to detect asymptomatic Aβ-PET positivity (AUC = 0.55 and 0.63, respectively). However, when measured with a more phospho-specific assay, plasma pTau181 detected Aβ-positivity with high performance (AUC = 0.82, PDeLong, FDR < 0.007). In conclusion, serum GFAP, NfL and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 are valuable prognostic and/or monitoring tools in asymptomatic stages providing complementary information in a time- and pathology-dependent manner.",2024,blood biomarkers; monitoring; positron emission tomography; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease; prognosis,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Gray Matter; Prospective Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Positron-Emission Tomography,"De Meyer, S; Blujdea, ER; Schaeverbeke, J; Reinartz, M; Luckett, ES; Adamczuk, K; Van Laere, K; Dupont, P; Teunissen, CE; Vandenberghe, R; Poesen, K"

"Morphometric and Nanomechanical Screening of Peripheral Blood Cells with Atomic Force Microscopy for Label-Free Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.","Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are complex, multifactorial disorders with significant social and economic impact in today's society. NDDs are predicted to become the second-most common cause of death in the next few decades due to an increase in life expectancy but also to a lack of early diagnosis and mainly symptomatic treatment. Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic methods, there are yet no reliable biomarkers identifying the complex pathways contributing to these pathologies. The development of new approaches for early diagnosis and new therapies, together with the identification of non-invasive and more cost-effective diagnostic biomarkers, is one of the main trends in NDD biomedical research. Here we summarize data on peripheral biomarkers, biofluids (cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma), and peripheral blood cells (platelets (PLTs) and red blood cells (RBCs)), reported so far for the three most common NDDs-Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PLTs and RBCs, beyond their primary physiological functions, are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of biomarkers for NDDs. Special attention is given to the morphological and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and RBCs as biophysical markers for the three pathologies. Modifications of the surface nanostructure and morphometric and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and RBCs from patients with AD, PD, and ALS have been revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is currently experiencing rapid and widespread adoption in biomedicine and clinical medicine, in particular for early diagnostics of various medical conditions. AFM is a unique instrument without an analog, allowing the generation of three-dimensional cell images with extremely high spatial resolution at near-atomic scale, which are complemented by insights into the mechanical properties of cells and subcellular structures. Data demonstrate that AFM can distinguish between the three pathologies and the normal, healthy state. The specific PLT and RBC signatures can serve as biomarkers in combination with the currently used diagnostic tools. We highlight the strong correlation of the morphological and nanomechanical signatures between RBCs and PLTs in PD, ALS, and AD.",2023,atomic force microscopy; biomarkers; cell morphology; cell nanomechanics; neurodegenerative disorders; platelets; red blood cells,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Alzheimer Disease; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Blood Cells","Taneva, SG; Todinova, S; Andreeva, T"
Neuro-Urology and Biobanking: An Integrated Approach for Advancing Research and Improving Patient Care.,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neuro-urological disorders is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Through the establishment of comprehensive biobanks, researchers can collect and store various biological specimens, including urine, blood, tissue, and DNA samples, to study these mechanisms. In the context of neuro-urology, biobanking facilitates the identification of genetic variations, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression patterns associated with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. These conditions often present as symptoms of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, and many others. Biobanking of tissue specimens from such patients is essential to understand why these diseases cause the respective symptoms and what can be done to alleviate them. The utilization of high-throughput technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and gene expression profiling, enables researchers to explore the molecular landscape of these conditions in an unprecedented manner. The development of specific and reliable biomarkers resulting from these efforts may help in early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective monitoring of neuro-urological conditions, leading to improved patient care and management. Furthermore, these biomarkers could potentially facilitate the monitoring of novel therapies currently under investigation in neuro-urological clinical trials. This comprehensive review explores the synergistic integration of neuro-urology and biobanking, with particular emphasis on the translation of biobanking approaches in molecular research in neuro-urology. We discuss the advantages of biobanking in neuro-urological studies, the types of specimens collected and their applications in translational research. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of standardization and quality assurance when collecting samples and discuss challenges that may compromise sample quality and impose limitations on their subsequent utilization. Finally, we give recommendations for sampling in multicenter studies, examine sustainability issues associated with biobanking, and provide future directions for this dynamic field.",2023,biobank; biomarker; biorepository; biospecimen; lower urinary tract symptoms; neuro-urology; neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction; translational research,Humans; Urology; Biological Specimen Banks; Patient Care; Neurology; Alzheimer Disease,"Botter, SM; Kessler, TM"

Plasma Neurofilament Light Chains as Blood-Based Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome.,"The number of elderly dogs is increasing significantly worldwide, and many elderly dogs develop canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CCDS). CCDS is the canine analog of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. It is very important to develop techniques for detecting CDDS in dogs. Thus, we used the detection of neurofilament light chains (NfL) in plasma as a blood-based biomarker for the early diagnosis of canine Alzheimer's disease using immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) technology by immobilizing NfL antibodies on magnetic nanoparticles. According to the 50-point CCDS rating scale, we divided 36 dogs into 15 with CCDS and 21 without the disease. The results of our IMR assay showed that the plasma NfL levels of dogs with CCDS were significantly increased compared to normal dogs (",2023,canine; cognitive dysfunction; immunomagnetic reduction; neurofilament light chain,,"Wu, CH; Pan, XS; Su, LY; Yang, SY"

Canine cognitive decline and Alzheimer disease: clinical insights to solve a shared one-health problem.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among older adults. Current AD treatment options are limited, and the absence of appropriate research animals has significantly hindered the development of new AD therapies. Canine cognitive decline (CCD) is a major determinant of morbidity in older animals, with alterations in blood biomarkers, neuropathology, physiology, and behavior comparable to those seen in humans diagnosed with dementia and AD. The one-health goal of achieving optimal health is supported by academics, researchers, and governments. Veterinarians' ability to identify patients in the early stages of CCD is crucial to the successful implementation of interventions that can improve the quality of life of affected dogs. Timely identification of CCD also opens opportunities for innovative interdisciplinary research that will contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, early detection, and effective treatments for AD, ultimately benefiting human health as well. Until now, veterinary practitioners have played limited roles as interdisciplinary leaders in the One Health initiative to combat disease. The authors discuss how client-owned animals with spontaneous, naturally occurring CCD can play a significant role as disease-relevant surrogates for translational AD research. The proposed Dogs Overcoming Geriatric Memory and Aging (DOGMA) Study to be conducted in veterinary practices will analyze the relationship between blood biomarkers and biometric behavior in mature and older dogs, with the aim of establishing benchmark CCD data.

Tau: a biomarker of Huntington's disease.,"Developing effective treatments for patients with Huntington's disease (HD)-a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe cognitive, motor and psychiatric impairments-is proving extremely challenging. While the monogenic nature of this condition enables to identify individuals at risk, robust biomarkers would still be extremely valuable to help diagnose disease onset and progression, and especially to confirm treatment efficacy. If measurements of cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament levels, for example, have demonstrated use in recent clinical trials, other proteins may prove equal, if not greater, relevance as biomarkers. In fact, proteins such as tau could specifically be used to detect/predict cognitive affectations. We have herein reviewed the literature pertaining to the association between tau levels and cognitive states, zooming in on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury in which imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood samples have been interrogated or used to unveil a strong association between tau and cognition. Collectively, these areas of research have accrued compelling evidence to suggest tau-related measurements as both diagnostic and prognostic tools for clinical practice. The abundance of information retrieved in this niche of study has laid the groundwork for further understanding whether tau-related biomarkers may be applied to HD and guide future investigations to better understand and treat this disease.",2023,,Humans; Huntington Disease; tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Lepinay, E; Cicchetti, F"

Remote evaluation of sleep to enhance understanding of early dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (RESTED-AD): an observational cohort study protocol.,"Sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are well recognised in both AD (Alzheimer's Disease) dementia and MCI-AD (Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease). Such abnormalities include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, decreased sleep efficiency, increased sleep fragmentation and sundowning. Enhancing understanding of sleep abnormalities may unveil targets for intervention in sleep, a promising approach given hypotheses that sleep disorders may exacerbate AD pathological progression and represent a contributory factor toward impaired cognitive performance and worse quality of life. This may also permit early diagnosis of AD pathology, widely acknowledged as a pre-requisite for future disease-modifying therapies. This study aims to bridge the divide between in-laboratory polysomnographic studies which allow for rich characterisation of sleep but in an unnatural setting, and naturalistic studies typically approximating sleep through use of non-EEG wearable devices. It is also designed to record sleep patterns over a 2 month duration sufficient to capture both infradian rhythm and compensatory responses following suboptimal sleep. Finally, it harnesses an extensively phenotyped population including with AD blood biomarkers. Its principal aims are to improve characterisation of sleep and biological rhythms in individuals with AD, particularly focusing on micro-architectural measures of sleep, compensatory responses to suboptimal sleep and the relationship between sleep parameters, biological rhythms and cognitive performance.",2023,AD; Alzheimer’s disease; Circadian; Dementia; EEG; Infradian; MCI; Mild cognitive impairment; Sleep,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Quality of Life; Sleep; Dementia; Cohort Studies; Observational Studies as Topic,"Blackman, J; Morrison, HD; Gabb, V; Biswas, B; Li, H; Turner, N; Jolly, A; Trender, W; Hampshire, A; Whone, A; Coulthard, E"
Head-to-head comparison between plasma p-tau217 and flortaucipir-PET in amyloid-positive patients with cognitive impairment.,"Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) has emerged as a promising biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

However, the relationship between p-tau and tau-PET is less characterized within cognitively impaired patients with a biomarker-supported diagnosis of AD.

Caloric Restriction Intervention Alters Specific Circulating Biomarkers of the Senescence-Associated Secretome in Middle-Aged and Older Adults With Obesity and Prediabetes in an 18-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Cellular senescence is a biological aging process that is exacerbated by obesity and leads to inflammation and age- and obesogenic-driven chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes. Caloric restriction (CR) may improve metabolic function in part by reducing cellular senescence and the pro-inflammatory senescence-associated phenotype (SASP). We conducted an ancillary investigation of an 18-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of CR (n = 31) or Control (n = 27) in 58 middle-aged/older adults (57.6 ± 5.8 years; 75% Women) with obesity and prediabetes. We measured mRNA expression of select senescence and apoptosis genes in blood CD3 + T cells (qRT-PCR) and a panel of 25 plasma SASP proteins (Luminex/multiplex; ELISA). Participants randomized to CR lost -10.8 ± 0.9 kg (-11.3% ± 5.4%) over 18 weeks compared with +0.5 ± 0.9 kg (+0.03% ± 3.5%) in Control group. T-cell expression of senescence biomarkers, p16INK4a and p21CIP1/WAF1, and apoptosis markers, BCL2L1 and BAK1, was not different between CR and Control groups in age, race, and sex-adjusted mixed models (p > .05, all). Iterative principal axis factor analysis was used to develop composite SASP Factors, and the Factors comprising TNFRI, TNFRII, uPAR, MMP1, GDF15, OPN, Fas, and MPO were significantly altered with CR intervention (age, sex, race-adjusted mixed model time × treatment F = 4.17, p ≤ .05) and associated with the degree of weight loss (R2 = 0.12, p ≤ .05).

Alzheimer's disease: The role of T lymphocytes in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.,"Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of progressive cognitive decline globally, has been reported to be enhanced by neuroinflammation. Brain-resident innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells work together to produce neuroinflammation. Studies over the past decade have established the neuroimmune axis present in Alzheimer's disease; the crosstalk between adaptive and innate immune cells within and outside the brain is crucial to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although the role of the adaptive immune system in Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, it has been hypothesized that the brain's immune homeostasis is significantly disrupted, which greatly contributes to neuroinflammation. Brain-infiltrating T cells possess proinflammatory phenotypes and activities that directly contribute to neuroinflammation. The pro-inflammatory activities of the adaptive immune system in Alzheimer's disease are characterized by the upregulation of effector T cell activities and the downregulation of regulatory T cell activities in the brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. In this review, we discuss the major impact of T lymphocytes on the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the role and mechanism of action of T cells in Alzheimer's disease would significantly contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of the disease. This knowledge could also be crucial to the development of immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Microglia; Neurodegeneration; Neuroinflammation; T lymphocyte,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Microglia,"Asamu, MO; Oladipo, OO; Abayomi, OA; Adebayo, AA"

Ascertainment and Statistical Issues for Randomized Trials of Cardiovascular Interventions for Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.,"There has been considerable progress in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, reducing the population burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recently, some randomized trials, including the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), have suggested that improvements in cardiovascular risk factors may also slow cognitive decline and reduce the eventual development of dementia. Unfortunately, the randomized trial template that has been used repeatedly to successfully demonstrate reductions in major adverse cardiac events faces several design and analytic obstacles when applied in the context of cognitive decline and dementia. Here, we review these obstacles, motivated by SPRINT and the context of selecting an appropriate cognitive end point for future preventive randomized trials. A few options are available, spanning neuropsychological test scores or composites reflecting specific domains of cognitive function, adjudicated cognitive impairment, or potentially physiological biomarkers. This choice entails considerations around statistical power, modes of ascertainment, the clinical relevance of treatment effects, a myriad of statistical issues (interval censoring, missing data, the competing risk of death, practice effects, etc), as well as ethical considerations around equipoise. Collectively, these considerations indicate that trials aiming to mitigate the cardiovascular contribution to cognitive decline and dementia will generally need to be large, inclusive of a wide age range of older adults, and with multiple years of follow-up.",2024,biomarkers; cognition; cognitive dysfunction; dementia,Humans; Aged; Dementia; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Cardiovascular Diseases,"Pajewski, NM; Donohue, MC; Raman, R; Espeland, MA"
A blood biomarker of accelerated aging in the body associates with worse structural integrity in the brain: replication across three cohorts.,"Biological aging is the correlated decline of multi-organ system integrity central to the etiology of many age-related diseases. A novel epigenetic measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE, is associated with cognitive dysfunction, incident dementia, and mortality. Here, we tested for associations between DunedinPACE and structural MRI phenotypes in three datasets spanning midlife to advanced age: the Dunedin Study (age=45 years), the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (mean age=63 years), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (mean age=75 years). We also tested four additional epigenetic measures of aging: the Horvath clock, the Hannum clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Across all datasets (total N observations=3,380; total N individuals=2,322), faster DunedinPACE was associated with lower total brain volume, lower hippocampal volume, and thinner cortex. In two datasets, faster DunedinPACE was associated with greater burden of white matter hyperintensities. Across all measures, DunedinPACE and GrimAge had the strongest and most consistent associations with brain phenotypes. Our findings suggest that single timepoint measures of multi-organ decline such as DunedinPACE could be useful for gauging nervous system health.",2023,,,"Whitman, ET; Ryan, CP; Abraham, WC; Addae, A; Corcoran, DL; Elliott, ML; Hogan, S; Ireland, D; Keenan, R; Knodt, AR; Melzer, TR; Poulton, R; Ramrakha, S; Sugden, K; Williams, BS; Zhou, J; Hariri, AR; Belsky, DW; Moffitt, TE; Caspi, A"

Interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on trajectories of tau accumulation.,"Cerebrovascular pathology often co-exists with Alzheimer's disease pathology and can contribute to Alzheimer's disease-related clinical progression. However, the degree to which vascular burden contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathological progression is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on both baseline tau tangle load and longitudinal tau accumulation. We included 1229 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 Study, including cognitively unimpaired and impaired participants with and without biomarker-confirmed amyloid-β pathology. All underwent baseline tau-PET (18F-RO948), and a subset (n = 677) underwent longitudinal tau-PET after 2.5 ± 1.0 years. Tau-PET uptake was computed for a temporal meta-region-of-interest. We focused on four main vascular imaging features and risk factors: microbleeds; white matter lesion volume; stroke-related events (infarcts, lacunes and haemorrhages); and the Framingham Heart Study Cardiovascular Disease risk score. To validate our in vivo results, we examined 1610 autopsy cases from an Arizona-based neuropathology cohort on three main vascular pathological features: cerebral amyloid angiopathy; white matter rarefaction; and infarcts. For the in vivo cohort, primary analyses included age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear mixed models between tau-PET (outcome) and interactions between time, amyloid-β and each vascular feature (predictors). For the neuropathology cohort, age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear models between tau tangle density (outcome) and an interaction between plaque density and each vascular feature (predictors) were performed. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we observed a significant interaction between microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology on greater baseline tau load (β = 0.68, P < 0.001) and longitudinal tau accumulation (β = 0.11, P < 0.001). For white matter lesion volume, we did not observe a significant independent interaction effect with amyloid-β on tau after accounting for microbleeds. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we further found that stroke-related events showed a significant negative interaction with amyloid-β on longitudinal tau (β = -0.08, P < 0.001). In cognitively impaired individuals, there were no significant interaction effects between cerebrovascular and amyloid-β pathology at all. In the neuropathology dataset, the in vivo observed interaction effects between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and plaque density (β = 0.38, P < 0.001) and between infarcts and plaque density (β = -0.11, P = 0.005) on tau tangle density were replicated. To conclude, we demonstrated that cerebrovascular pathology-in the presence of amyloid-β pathology-modifies tau accumulation in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, the co-occurrence of microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology was associated with greater accumulation of tau aggregates during early disease stages. This opens the possibility that interventions targeting microbleeds may attenuate the rate of tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; tau; vascular burden; vascular risk,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Stroke; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Plaque, Amyloid; Infarction; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Apolipoproteins E","Coomans, EM; van Westen, D; Binette, AP; Strandberg, O; Spotorno, N; Serrano, GE; Beach, TG; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Ossenkoppele, R; Hansson, O"
Common microRNA regulated pathways in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation. Recently, miRNA dysregulation has been found in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The diagnosis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is currently challenging, mainly occurring when pathology is already present, and although treatments are available for both diseases, the role of treatment is primarily to prevent or delay the progress of the diseases instead of fully overcoming the diseases. Therefore, the challenge in the near future will be to determine effective drugs to tackle the dysregulated biological pathways in neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we describe the dysregulation of miRNAs in blood of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients with the aim to identify common mechanisms between the 2 pathologies and potentially to identify common therapeutic targets which can stop or delay the progression of two most frequent neuropathologies. Two independent systematic reviews, bioinformatic analysis, and experiment validation were performed to identify whether AD and PD share common pathways. A total of 15 common miRNAs were found in the literature and 13 common KEGG pathways. Among the common miRNAs, two were selected for validation in a small cohort of AD and PD patients. Let-7f-5p and miR-29b-3p showed to be good predictors in blood of PD patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; biomarkers; microRNA; neurodegeneration; therapeutic targets,,"Awuson-David, B; Williams, AC; Wright, B; Hill, LJ; Di Pietro, V"

Biomarkers and Risk Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,"Dementia is a chronic syndrome which is common among the elderly and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality for patients and their caregivers. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of clinical dementia, is biologically characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The onset of AD begins decades before manifestation of symptoms and clinical diagnosis, underlining the need to shift from clinical diagnosis of AD to a more objective diagnosis using biomarkers. Having performed a literature search of original articles and reviews on PubMed and Google Scholar, we present this review detailing the existing biomarkers and risk assessment tools for AD. The prevalence of dementia in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is predicted to increase over the next couple of years. Thus, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers that may be appropriate for use in LMICs, considering the following factors: sensitivity, specificity, invasiveness, and affordability of the biomarkers. We also explored risk assessment tools and the potential use of artificial intelligence/machine learning solutions for diagnosing, assessing risks, and monitoring the progression of AD in low-resource settings. Routine use of AD biomarkers has yet to gain sufficient ground in clinical settings. Therefore, clinical diagnosis of AD will remain the mainstay in LMICs for the foreseeable future. Efforts should be made towards the development of low-cost, easily administered risk assessment tools to identify individuals who are at risk of AD in the population. We recommend that stakeholders invest in education, research and development targeted towards effective risk assessment and management.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; artificial intelligence; biomarkers; blood; cerebrospinal fluid; low- and middle-income countries; neuroimaging; risk,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Developing Countries; Artificial Intelligence; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Risk Assessment; tau Proteins,"Adewale, BA; Coker, MM; Ogunniyi, A; Kalaria, RN; Akinyemi, RO"

"Preservation of Biomarkers Associated with Alzheimer's Disease (Amyloid Peptides 1-38, 1-40, 1-42, Tau Protein, Beclin 1) in the Blood of Neonates after Perinatal Asphyxia.","Perinatal asphyxia is a complex disease involving massive death of brain cells in full-term newborns. The most impressive consequence of perinatal asphyxia is a neurodegenerative brain injury called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Management of newborns after perinatal asphyxia is very difficult due to the lack of measurable biomarkers that would be able to assess the severity of the brain injury in the future, help in the selection of therapy, assess the results of treatment and determine the prognosis for the future. Thus, these limitations make long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes unpredictable during life. Quantifying biomarkers that can detect subclinical changes at a stage where routine brain monitoring or imaging is still mute would be a major advance in the care of neonates with brain neurodegeneration after asphyxia. Understanding the effect of perinatal asphyxia on changes in blood neurodegenerative biomarkers over time, which would be commonly used to assess the severity of postpartum encephalopathy, would be an important step in developing precision in predicting the consequences of brain injuries. We urgently need more accurate early predictive markers to guide clinicians when to use neuroprotective therapy. The needed neurodegenerative biomarkers may represent neuronal pathological changes that can be recognized by new technologies such as genomic and proteomic. Nevertheless, the simultaneous blood tau protein and various amyloid changes with the addition of an autophagy marker beclin 1 after perinatal asphyxia have not been studied. We decided to evaluate serum biomarkers of neuronal injury characteristic for Alzheimer's disease such as amyloid peptides (1-38, 1-40 and 1-42), tau protein and beclin 1, which can predict the progression of brain neurodegeneration in future. In this paper, we report for the first time the significant changes in the above molecules in the blood after asphyxia compared to healthy controls during the 1-7, 8-14 and 15+ days ELISA test.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; autophagy; beclin 1; biomarkers; blood; perinatal asphyxia; tau protein,"Infant, Newborn; Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Beclin-1; Asphyxia; Proteomics; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Brain Injuries; Biomarkers","Tarkowska, A; Furmaga-Jabłońska, W; Bogucki, J; Kocki, J; Pluta, R"
Identification of Plasma Proteins as Biomarkers for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease Using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"Blood proteins can be used for biomarkers to monitor the progression of cognitive decline, even in the early stages of disease. In this study, we developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based blood test to identify plasma proteins that can be used to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using this system, we quantified plasma proteins using isotope-labeled synthetic peptides. A total of 192 patients, including 63 with AD, 71 with MCI, and 58 non-demented controls (NDCs), were analyzed. Multinomial regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to identify specific combinations of plasma protein panels that could differentiate among NDCs, those with MCI, and those with AD. We identified eight plasma protein biomarker candidates that can be used to distinguish between MCI and AD. These biomarkers were associated with coagulation pathways, innate immunity, lipid metabolism, and nutrition. The clinical potential to differentiate cognitive impairment from NDC was assessed using area under the curve values from ROC analysis, which yielded values of 0.83 for males and 0.71 for females. This LC-MS-based plasma protein panel allows the pathophysiology of AD to be followed through detection of cognitive decline and disease progression markers.",2023,biomarker; dementia prevention; mass spectrometry; multiple reaction monitoring; proteomics,"Female; Male; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Chromatography, Liquid; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Blood Proteins","Inoue, M; Suzuki, H; Meno, K; Liu, S; Korenaga, T; Uchida, K"

Electrochemical miRNA-34a-based biosensor for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia type and a leading cause of death and disability in the elderly. Diagnosis is expensive and invasive, urging the development of new, affordable, and less invasive diagnostic tools. The identification of changes in the expression of non-coding RNAs prompts the development of diagnostic tools to detect disease-specific blood biomarkers. Building on this idea, this work reports a novel electrochemical microRNA (miRNA) biosensor for the diagnosis of AD, based on carbon screen-printed electrodes (C-SPEs) modified with two gold nanostructures and a complementary anti-miR-34a oligonucleotide probe. This biosensor showed good target affinity, reflected on a 100 pM to 1 μM linearity range and a limit of detection (LOD) of 39 pM in buffer and 94 aM in serum. Moreover, the biosensor's response was not affected by serum compounds, indicating selectivity for miR-34a. The biosensor also detected miR-34a in the cell culture medium of a common AD model, stimulated with a neurotoxin to increase miR-34a secretion. Overall, the proposed biosensor makes a solid case for the introduction of a novel, inexpensive, and minimally invasive tool for the early diagnosis of AD, based on the detection of a circulating miRNA overexpressed in this pathology.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Carbon screen-printed electrodes; Electrochemical biosensor; Gold nanoparticles; miRNA-34a,Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; MicroRNAs; Carbon; Cell Culture Techniques; Electrodes,"Pereira, RL; Oliveira, D; Pêgo, AP; Santos, SD; Moreira, FTC"

Cis P-tau is a central circulating and placental etiologic driver and therapeutic target of preeclampsia.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is the leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality globally and may trigger dementia later in life in mothers and their offspring. However, the etiological drivers remain elusive. Cis P-tau is an early etiological driver and blood biomarker in pre-clinical Alzheimer's and after vascular or traumatic brain injury, which can be targeted by stereo-specific antibody, with clinical trials ongoing. Here we find significant cis P-tau in the placenta and serum of PE patients, and in primary human trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia or sera from PE patients due to Pin1 inactivation. Depletion of cis P-tau from PE patient sera by the antibody prevents their ability to disrupt trophoblast invasion and endovascular activity and to cause the PE-like pathological and clinical features in pregnant humanized tau mice. Our studies uncover that cis P-tau is a central circulating etiological driver and its stereo-specific antibody is valuable for early PE diagnosis and treatment.",2023,,Female; Pregnancy; Humans; Animals; Mice; Placenta; Pre-Eclampsia; Causality; Trophoblasts; Antibodies; Mothers,"Jash, S; Banerjee, S; Cheng, S; Wang, B; Qiu, C; Kondo, A; Ernerudh, J; Zhou, XZ; Lu, KP; Sharma, S"

Unsupervised contrastive graph learning for resting-state functional MRI analysis and brain disorder detection.,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) helps characterize regional interactions that occur in the human brain at a resting state. Existing research often attempts to explore fMRI biomarkers that best predict brain disease progression using machine/deep learning techniques. Previous fMRI studies have shown that learning-based methods usually require a large amount of labeled training data, limiting their utility in clinical practice where annotating data is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To this end, we propose an unsupervised contrastive graph learning (UCGL) framework for fMRI-based brain disease analysis, in which a pretext model is designed to generate informative fMRI representations using unlabeled training data, followed by model fine-tuning to perform downstream disease identification tasks. Specifically, in the pretext model, we first design a bi-level fMRI augmentation strategy to increase the sample size by augmenting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, and then employ two parallel graph convolutional networks for fMRI feature extraction in an unsupervised contrastive learning manner. This pretext model can be optimized on large-scale fMRI datasets, without requiring labeled training data. This model is further fine-tuned on to-be-analyzed fMRI data for downstream disease detection in a task-oriented learning manner. We evaluate the proposed method on three rs-fMRI datasets for cross-site and cross-dataset learning tasks. Experimental results suggest that the UCGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in automated diagnosis of three brain diseases (i.e., major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease) with rs-fMRI data.",2023,brain disorder; data augmentation; fine-tuning; functional MRI; small-sample-size,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Rest; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease","Wang, X; Chu, Y; Wang, Q; Cao, L; Qiao, L; Zhang, L; Liu, M"
Elevated plasma sclerostin is associated with high brain amyloid-β load in cognitively normal older adults.,"Osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) mainly affect older individuals, and the possibility of an underlying link contributing to their shared epidemiological features has rarely been investigated. In the current study, we investigated the association between levels of plasma sclerostin (SOST), a protein primarily produced by bone, and brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) load, a pathological hallmark of AD. The study enrolled participants meeting a set of screening inclusion and exclusion criteria and were stratified into Aβ- (n = 65) and Aβ+ (n = 35) according to their brain Aβ load assessed using Aβ-PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Plasma SOST levels, apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) genotype and several putative AD blood-biomarkers including Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40, neurofilament light (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181 and p-tau231) were detected and compared. It was found that plasma SOST levels were significantly higher in the Aβ+ group (71.49 ± 25.00 pmol/L) compared with the Aβ- group (56.51 ± 22.14 pmol/L) (P < 0.01). Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis showed that plasma SOST concentrations were positively correlated with brain Aβ load (ρ = 0.321, P = 0.001). Importantly, plasma SOST combined with Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio significantly increased the area under the curve (AUC) when compared with using Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio alone (AUC = 0.768 vs 0.669, P = 0.027). In conclusion, plasma SOST levels are elevated in cognitively unimpaired older adults at high risk of AD and SOST could complement existing plasma biomarkers to assist in the detection of preclinical AD.",2023,,,"Yuan, J; Pedrini, S; Thota, R; Doecke, J; Chatterjee, P; Sohrabi, HR; Teunissen, CE; Verberk, IMW; Stoops, E; Vanderstichele, H; Meloni, BP; Mitchell, C; Rainey-Smith, S; Goozee, K; Tai, ACP; Ashton, N; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Gao, J; Liu, D; Mastaglia, F; Inderjeeth, C; Zheng, M; Martins, RN"
Expression analysis of inhibitory B7 family members in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health problem due to its complexity, which frequently makes the development of treatment methods extremely difficult. Therefore, new methodologies are necessary to investigate the pathophysiology of AD and to treat AD. The interaction of immune modulation and neurodegeneration has added new dimensions in current knowledge of AD etiology and offers an attractive opportunity for the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapies. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we compared the expression levels of inhibitory B7 family members (B7-1, B7-2, B7-H1, B7-DC, B7-H3, B7-H4, B7-H5, B7-H7, and ILDR2), as immune regulators, in the peripheral blood of late-onset AD (LOAD) patients (n = 50) and healthy individuals (n = 50). The levels of B7-2, B7-H4, ILDR2, and B7-DC expression were significantly higher in-patient blood samples than in control blood samples. Furthermore, we discovered a substantial positive correlation between all gene expression levels. In addition, the current study indicated that ILDR2, B7-H4, B7-2, and B7-DC might serve as diagnostic biomarkers to identify LOAD patients from healthy persons. The present work provides additional evidence for the significance of inhibitory B7 family members to the etiology of LOAD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; B7 family; Biomarker; Expression analysis; Immune checkpoint,Humans; V-Set Domain-Containing T-Cell Activation Inhibitor 1; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers,"Sabaie, H; Tamimi, P; Gharesouran, J; Salkhordeh, Z; Asadi, MR; Sharifi-Bonab, M; Shirvani-Farsani, Z; Taheri, M; Sayad, A; Rezazadeh, M"

Exploring the significance of lipids in Alzheimer's disease and the potential of extracellular vesicles.,"Lipids play a significant role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) structure and function, and the dysregulation of lipid metabolism is known to occur in many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we review what is currently known about lipid dyshomeostasis in Alzheimer's disease. We propose that small extracellular vesicle (sEV) lipids may provide insight into the pathophysiology and progression of Alzheimer's disease. This stems from the recognition that sEV likely contributes to disease pathogenesis, but also an understanding that sEV can serve as a source of potential biomarkers. While the protein and RNA content of sEV in the CNS diseases have been studied extensively, our understanding of the lipidome of sEV in the CNS is still in its infancy.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; blood; central nervous system; lipids; small extracellular vesicles,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Extracellular Vesicles; Lipid Metabolism; Biomarkers; Animals; Lipids,"Su, H; Masters, CL; Bush, AI; Barnham, KJ; Reid, GE; Vella, LJ"

A two-step workflow based on plasma p-tau217 to screen for amyloid β positivity with further confirmatory testing only in uncertain cases.,"Cost-effective strategies for identifying amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity in patients with cognitive impairment are urgently needed with recent approvals of anti-Aβ immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood biomarkers can accurately detect AD pathology, but it is unclear whether their incorporation into a full diagnostic workflow can reduce the number of confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) tests needed while accurately classifying patients. We evaluated a two-step workflow for determining Aβ-PET status in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from two independent memory clinic-based cohorts (n = 348). A blood-based model including plasma tau protein 217 (p-tau217), age and APOE ε4 status was developed in BioFINDER-1 (area under the curve (AUC) = 89.3%) and validated in BioFINDER-2 (AUC = 94.3%). In step 1, the blood-based model was used to stratify the patients into low, intermediate or high risk of Aβ-PET positivity. In step 2, we assumed referral only of intermediate-risk patients to CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 testing, whereas step 1 alone determined Aβ-status for low- and high-risk groups. Depending on whether lenient, moderate or stringent thresholds were used in step 1, the two-step workflow overall accuracy for detecting Aβ-PET status was 88.2%, 90.5% and 92.0%, respectively, while reducing the number of necessary CSF tests by 85.9%, 72.7% and 61.2%, respectively. In secondary analyses, an adapted version of the BioFINDER-1 model led to successful validation of the two-step workflow with a different plasma p-tau217 immunoassay in patients with cognitive impairment from the TRIAD cohort (n = 84). In conclusion, using a plasma p-tau217-based model for risk stratification of patients with MCI can substantially reduce the need for confirmatory testing while accurately classifying patients, offering a cost-effective strategy to detect AD in memory clinic settings.",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Workflow; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Blood Proteins; Alzheimer Disease","Brum, WS; Cullen, NC; Janelidze, S; Ashton, NJ; Zimmer, ER; Therriault, J; Benedet, AL; Rahmouni, N; Tissot, C; Stevenson, J; Servaes, S; Triana-Baltzer, G; Kolb, HC; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Rosa-Neto, P; Blennow, K; Hansson, O"
Healthy brain aging and delayed dementia in Texas rural elderly.,"Healthy aging is the process of preserving and enhancing one's independence, physical and mental well-being, and overall quality of life. It involves the mental, emotional, and cognitive wellness. Although biological and genetic factors have a significant influence on the process of aging gracefully, other adjustable factors also play a crucial role. Adopting positive behaviors such as maintaining a nutritious and balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, effectively managing stress and anxiety, ensuring sufficient sleep, nurturing spiritual coping mechanisms, and prioritizing overall well-being from an early stage can collectively influence both lifespan and the quality of health during advanced years. We aim to explore the potential impacts of biological, psychosocial, and environmental factors on the process of healthy cognitive aging in individuals who exhibit healthy aging. Additionally, we plan to present initial findings that demonstrate how maintaining good cognitive health during aging could potentially postpone the emergence of neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesize that there will be strong associations between biological, environmental, and social factors that cause some elderly to be superior in cognitive health than others. For preliminary data collection, we recruited 25 cognitively healthy individuals and 5 individuals with MCI/AD between the ages of 60-90 years. We conducted anthropometric measurements, and blood biomarker testing, administered surveys, and obtained structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and sub-scores for the healthy group were also reported. We found that at baseline, individuals exhibiting healthy cognitive aging, and those with MCI/AD had comparable measures of anthropometrics and blood biomarkers. The healthy group exhibited lower signs of brain volume loss and the ones observed were age-related. Moreover, within the healthy group, there was a significant correlation (p = 0.003) between age and MoCA scores. Conversely, within the individuals with MCI/AD, the MRI scans showed disease signs of grey and white matter and loss of cerebral volume. Healthy brain aging is a scientific area that remains under-explored. Our current study findings support our hypothesis. Future studies are required in diverse populations to determine the various biological, psychological, environmental, lifestyle, and social factors that contribute to it.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Body mass index; Charlson Comorbidity Index; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mild cognitive impairment; Montreal cognitive assessment,"Humans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Healthy Aging; Quality of Life; Texas; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Basu, T; Sehar, U; Malhotra, K; Culberson, J; Khan, H; Morton, H; Orlov, E; Brownell, M; Reddy, PH"
Polydopamine-coated hexagonal boron nitride-based electrochemical immunosensing of T-Tau as a marker of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex pathological process that is one of the leading causes of dementia globally. The demand for diagnostic tools that are minimally invasive, timely, and accurate is on the rise. Total tau (T-Tau) protein in blood serum is a promising biomarker for predicting early-stage AD diagnosis. In this study, the hexagonal boron nitride (HBN) based immunosensor platform was developed to detect T-Tau in artificial blood serum. After the exfoliation of HBN, its surface was coated with polydopamine (PDA) in alkaline conditions. The Anti-T-Tau was immobilized on a hydrophilic nanocomposite surface using PDA's reactive catechol and quinone groups, eliminating the need for extra crosslinkers. The working electrode surface of the screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was coated with HBN-PDA nanocomposite using the drop-casting method. The biofunctional surface was created by directly immobilizing Anti-T-Tau on the HBN-PDA nanocomposite-modified SPCE. The analytical performance of the HBN-PDA/Anti-T-Tau/T-Tau immunosensor in the presence of T-Tau isoforms was determined through electrochemical measurements. The linear detection range was 1-30 pg/mL with a detection limit of 0.42 pg/mL for T-Tau, which is suitable for detecting T-Tau in the blood serum.",2023,Hexagonal boron nitride; Immunosensing; Nanobiotechnology; Nanotechnology; Polydopamine; T-Tau protein detection,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biosensing Techniques; Immunoassay; Carbon,"Er Zeybekler, S"

First Observations of a Potential Association Between Accumulation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in the Central Nervous System and Markers of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The entire human population is exposed to persistent organic pollutants throughout their lives. Among them, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals widely used in industrial and consumer products that are known to exert adverse effects on human health. As they bioaccumulate in the human brain and are known to be neurotoxic in experimental models, they are assumed to be involved in neurodegenerative processes. In this proof-of-concept study, we measured the level of 18 PFAS in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 8 patients hospitalized with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus. We then analyzed whether PFAS levels could be related to both biological and clinical markers of Alzheimer's disease. We showed that PFAS and perfluorooctanesulfonate were found in all CSF samples from a French region without fluorochemical industries. Moreover, we observed a significant difference between the levels of PFAS and perfluorooctanesulfonate in the CSF of patients with both Alzheimer's disease markers and cognitive impairment compared with those with only 1 or neither. Two previous studies have shown that PFAS levels in human CSF increase with age and are linked to impaired blood-brain barrier integrity. Our results provide the first evidence of a link between PFAS accumulation in the central nervous system and clinical and biological markers of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Neurodegenerative diseases; PFAS,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Brain; Biomarkers,"Delcourt, N; Pouget, AM; Grivaud, A; Nogueira, L; Larvor, F; Marchand, P; Schmidt, E; Le Bizec, B"

Bilirubin and Redox Stress in Age-Related Brain Diseases.,"Cellular redox status has a crucial role in brain physiology, as well as in pathologic conditions. Physiologic senescence, by dysregulating cellular redox homeostasis and decreasing antioxidant defenses, enhances the central nervous system's susceptibility to diseases. The reduction of free radical accumulation through lifestyle changes, and the supplementation of antioxidants as a prophylactic and therapeutic approach to increase brain health, are strongly suggested. Bilirubin is a powerful endogenous antioxidant, with more and more recognized roles as a biomarker of disease resistance, a predictor of all-cause mortality, and a molecule that may promote health in adults. The alteration of the expression and activity of the enzymes involved in bilirubin production, as well as an altered blood bilirubin level, are often reported in neurologic conditions and neurodegenerative diseases (together denoted NCDs) in aging. These changes may predict or contribute both positively and negatively to the diseases. Understanding the role of bilirubin in the onset and progression of NCDs will be functional to consider the benefits vs. the drawbacks and to hypothesize the best strategies for its manipulation for therapeutic purposes.",2023,AHR; Alzheimer’s disease; NRF2; ataxia; brain cancers; dementia; heme oxygenase; schizophrenia; sclerosis; therapy,,"Llido, JP; Jayanti, S; Tiribelli, C; Gazzin, S"
Astaxanthin: A Marine Drug That Ameliorates Cerebrovascular-Damage-Associated Alzheimer's Disease in a Zebrafish Model via the Inhibition of Matrix Metalloprotease-13.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major type of dementia disorder. Common cognitive changes occur as a result of cerebrovascular damage (CVD) via the disruption of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). In diabetic cases, the progress of vascular dementia is faster and the AD rate is higher. Patients with type 2 diabetes are known to have a higher risk of the factor for AD progression. Hence, this study is designed to investigate the role of astaxanthin (AST) in CVD-associated AD in zebrafish via the inhibition of MMP-13 activity. CVD was developed through the intraperitoneal and intracerebral injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The AST (10 and 20 mg/L), donepezil (1 mg/L), and MMP-13 inhibitor (i.e., CL-82198; 10 μM) were exposed for 21 consecutive days in CVD animals. The cognitive changes in zebrafish were evaluated through light and dark chamber tests, a color recognition test, and a T-maze test. The biomarkers of AD pathology were assessed via the estimation of the cerebral extravasation of Evans blue, tissue nitrite, amyloid beta-peptide aggregation, MMP-13 activity, and acetylcholinesterase activity. The results revealed that exposure to AST leads to ameliorative behavioral and biochemical changes. Hence, AST can be used for the management of AD due to its multi-targeted actions, including MMP-13 inhibition.",2023,Lewy bodies; acetylcholinesterase; blood–brain barrier; cerebrovascular disease; streptozotocin; vascular dementia,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Zebrafish; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Matrix Metalloproteinase 13; Acetylcholinesterase; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Cardiovascular Diseases","Paramakrishnan, N; Lim, KG; Paramaswaran, Y; Ali, N; Waseem, M; Shazly, GA; Bin Jardan, YA; Muthuraman, A"
Vertical Graphene-Based Printed Electrochemical Biosensor for Simultaneous Detection of Four Alzheimer's Disease Blood Biomarkers.,"Early detection and timely intervention play a vital role in the effective management of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, the diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease based on a single blood biomarker is relatively low, and the combined use of multiple blood biomarkers can greatly improve diagnostic accuracy. Herein, we report a printed electrochemical biosensor based on vertical graphene (VG) modified with gold nanoparticles (VG@nanoAu) for the simultaneous detection of four Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers. The printed electrochemical electrode array was constructed by laser etching and inkjet printing. Then gold nanoparticles were modified onto the working electrode surface via electrodeposition to further improve the sensitivity of the sensor. In addition, the entire printed electrochemical sensing system incorporates an electrochemical micro-workstation and a smartphone. The customized electrochemical micro-workstation incorporates four electro-chemical control chips, enabling the sensor to simultaneously analyze four biomarkers. Consequently, the printed electrochemical sensing system exhibits excellent analytical performance due to the large surface area, biocompatibility, and good conductivity of VG@nanoAu. The detection limit of the sensing system for Aβ40, Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau181 was 0.072, 0.089, 0.071, and 0.051 pg/mL, respectively, which meets the detection requirements of Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers. The printed electrochemical sensing system also exhibits good specificity and stability. This work has great value and promising prospects for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using blood biomarkers.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; printed electrochemical biosensor; vertical graphene,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gold; Graphite; Metal Nanoparticles; Biomarkers,"Li, M; Zeng, Y; Huang, Z; Zhang, L; Liu, Y"
Alterations in Peripheral Metabolites as Key Actors in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Growing evidence supports that Alzheimer's disease (AD) could be regarded as a metabolic disease, accompanying central and peripheral metabolic disturbance. Nowadays, exploring novel and potentially alternative hallmarks for AD is needed. Peripheral metabolites based on blood and gut may provide new biochemical insights about disease mechanisms. These metabolites can influence brain energy homeostasis, maintain gut mucosal integrity, and regulate the host immune system, which may further play a key role in modulating the cognitive function and behavior of AD. Recently, metabolomics has been used to identify key AD-related metabolic changes and define metabolic changes during AD disease trajectory. This review aims to summarize the key blood- and microbial-derived metabolites that are altered in AD and identify the potential metabolic biomarkers of AD, which will provide future targets for precision therapeutic modulation.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Metabolomics; blood; gut microbiota; homeostasis.; metabolites,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognition; Metabolomics,"Sheng, C; Chu, X; He, Y; Ding, Q; Jia, S; Shi, Q; Sun, R; Song, L; Du, W; Liang, Y; Chen, N; Yang, Y; Wang, X"

"A new diagnostic tool for brain disorders: extracellular vesicles derived from neuron, astrocyte, and oligodendrocyte.","Brain disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting people's quality of life and causing economic burdens. The current clinical diagnosis of brain disorders relies solely on individual phenotypes and lacks accurate molecular biomarkers. An emerging field of research centers around extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanoscale membrane vesicles which can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. EVs in the blood are derived from various tissues, including the brain. Therefore, purifying central nervous system (CNS)-derived EVs from the blood and analyzing their contents may be a relatively non-invasive way to analyze brain molecular alterations and identify biomarkers in brain disorders. Recently, methods for capturing neuron-derived EVs (NDEs), astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEs), and oligodendrocyte-derived EVs (ODEs) in peripheral blood were reported. In this article, we provide an overview of the research history of EVs in the blood, specifically focusing on biomarker findings in six major brain disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and autism spectrum disorder). Additionally, we discuss the methodology employed for testing CNS-derived EVs. Among brain disorders, Alzheimer's disease has received the most extensive attention in EV research to date. Most studies focus on specific molecules, candidate proteins, or miRNAs. Notably, the most studied molecules implicated in the pathology of these diseases, such as Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein, exhibit good reproducibility. These findings suggest that CNS-derived EVs can serve as valuable tools for observing brain molecular changes minimally invasively. However, further analysis is necessary to understand the cargo composition of these EVs and improve isolation methods. Therefore, research efforts should prioritize the analysis of CNS-derived EVs' origin and genome-wide biomarker discovery studies.",2023,ADEs; NDEs; ODEs; biomarker; diagnosis; neurodegenerative disorders; psychiatric disorders,,"Wang, X; Yang, H; Liu, C; Liu, K"
Circular RNA ciRS-7 signature as a potential biomarker for the early detection of diabetes with Alzheimer's disease: a hypothesis.,"In the 1970s, Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) were first discovered in RNA viruses as viroids and were initially assumed to be RNA splicing defects. The roles and topologies of these circular RNA loops were later revealed using computer analysis and RNA-sequencing. They were found to demonstrate various functions, including protein scaffolding, parental gene regulation, microRNA sponges, and RNA-protein interactions. CircRNAs play a crucial role in controlling gene expression and are essential for biological development and illness detection, as demonstrated by their roles as miRNA sponges, endogenous RNAs, and potential biomarkers. Insulin resistance is caused by damage to β-cells in the pancreatic islets, which reduces the body's response to the hormone insulin. This reduction in insulin response hinders glucose from entering cells and providing energy for critical processes. As a result, insulin-resistant cells elevate blood sugar levels, leading to diabetes. Diabetes, in turn, increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, which can damage the heart and arteries. Additionally, an excess of insulin can impact the brain's chemical balance, contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, oxidative stress created by damaged pancreatic cells during high blood sugar conditions may lead to the destruction of brain cells and the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The hypothesis of this review is to provide an overview of the most dominant ciRS-7 circRNA identified in pancreatic islet cell dysfunction and neurologic disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. By considering ciRS-7 circRNA as a potential biomarker for diabetes, early detection and treatment of diabetes may be facilitated, potentially reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease onset in the future.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Biomarker; CiRS-7; Circular RNA; Diabetes,"Humans; RNA, Circular; Alzheimer Disease; Blood Glucose; RNA; MicroRNAs; Diabetes Mellitus; Biomarkers; Insulins","Singh, M; Guru, A; Murugan, R; Gopi, M; Arockiaraj, J"

Effect of apolipoprotein genotype and educational attainment on cognitive function in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) is genetically determined, but variability in age of symptom onset suggests additional factors may influence cognitive trajectories. Although apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and educational attainment both influence dementia onset in sporadic AD, evidence for these effects in ADAD is limited. To investigate the effects of APOE and educational attainment on age-related cognitive trajectories in ADAD, we analyzed data from 675 Presenilin-1 E280A mutation carriers and 594 non-carriers. Here we show that age-related cognitive decline is accelerated in ADAD mutation carriers who also have an APOE e4 allele compared to those who do not and delayed in mutation carriers who also have an APOE e2 allele compared to those who do not. Educational attainment is protective and moderates the effect of APOE on cognition. Despite ADAD mutation carriers being genetically determined to develop dementia, age-related cognitive decline may be influenced by other genetic and environmental factors.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins; Apolipoproteins E; Cognition; Educational Status; Genotype,"Langella, S; Barksdale, NG; Vasquez, D; Aguillon, D; Chen, Y; Su, Y; Acosta-Baena, N; Acosta-Uribe, J; Baena, AY; Garcia-Ospina, G; Giraldo-Chica, M; Tirado, V; Muñoz, C; Ríos-Romenets, S; Guzman-Martínez, C; Oliveira, G; Yang, HS; Vila-Castelar, C; Pruzin, JJ; Ghisays, V; Arboleda-Velasquez, JF; Kosik, KS; Reiman, EM; Lopera, F; Quiroz, YT"
"Biosensors, Recent Advances in Determination of BDNF and NfL.","Key biomarkers such as Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Neurofilament light chain (NfL) play important roles in the development and progression of many neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In these clinical conditions, the underlying biomarker processes are markedly heterogeneous. In this context, robust biomarker discovery is of critical importance for screening, early detection, and monitoring of neurological diseases. The difficulty of directly identifying biochemical processes in the central nervous system (CNS) is challenging. In recent years, biomarkers of CNS inflammatory response have been identified in various body fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tears. Furthermore, biotechnology and nanotechnology have facilitated the development of biosensor platforms capable of real-time detection of multiple biomarkers in clinically relevant samples. Biosensing technology is approaching maturity and will be deployed in communities, at which point screening programs and personalized medicine will become a reality. In this multidisciplinary review, our goal is to highlight clinical and current technological advances in the development of multiplex-based solutions for effective diagnosis and monitoring of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.

"Modifiable risk factors for dementia, cognition, and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 in a large-scale cohort of Australian older adults.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is preceded by years of silent pathological change. Our objective was to examine the associations between modifiable dementia risk factors, cognition, and plasma phosphorylated p-tau 181, a hallmark biomarker of AD in a large-scale community cohort. Participants (n = 738, mean age 65.41 years) from the Island Study Linking Ageing and Neurodegenerative Disease responded to online assessments collecting demographics, adherence to dementia risk factors and cognitive function, and provided a blood sample for analysis. We found less education was significantly associated with lower cognitive scores. Modifiable dementia risk factors were not associated with plasma p-tau 181. Further, we did not observe any significant relationships between plasma p-tau 181 and cognition. Nonmodifiable factors such as age, education, sex, and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 displayed significant associations with cognition and plasma p-tau 181. In a cognitively healthy community cohort of Tasmanian Australians, we did not observe any associations between modifiable risk factors for dementia and plasma p-tau 181. Nonmodifiable risk factors were associated with both cognition and plasma p-tau.

Harmonization and standardization of biofluid-based biomarker measurements for AT(N) classification in Alzheimer's disease.,"Fluid biomarkers are currently measured in cerebrospinal fluid and blood for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and are promising targets for drug development and for patients' follow-up in clinical trials. These biomarkers have been grouped in an unbiased research framework, the amyloid (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration (AT[N]) biomarker system to aid patients' early diagnosis and stratification. Metrological approaches relying on mass spectrometry have been used for the development of reference materials and reference measurement procedures. Despite their excellent performances as clinical tools, fluid biomarkers often present an important between-laboratory variation. Standardization efforts were carried out on the biomarkers currently included in the AT(N) classification system, involving the collaboration of national metrology institutes, clinicians, researchers, and in vitro diagnostic providers. This article provides an overview of current activities towards standardization.

Non-invasive Biomarkers for Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease: a New-Age Perspective.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly population. It gradually leads to memory loss, loss of thinking ability, and an overall cognitive decline. However, exhaustive literature is available to suggest that pathological changes in the brain occur decades before the first clinical symptoms appear. This review provides insight into the non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of AD that have been successfully studied in populations across the globe.

3D dynamic tracking Aβ plaques in live brains using vinyl-bridged dyes with two-photon excitation/NIR emission and large Stokes shifts.,"Real-time studies of biomarkers for neurological disorders present significant opportunities for diagnosing and treating related diseases, and fluorescent probes offer a promising approach to brain imaging. However, intracerebral fluorescence imaging is often limited by blood-brain barrier permeability and penetration depth. Moreover, only very few probes have rapid intracerebral metabolic properties, which are critical for in vivo imaging. Here, we developed a novel class of fluorescent dyes with two-photon excitation and near-infrared (NIR) emission (920/705 nm). The representative WAPP-4 probe exhibits a large Stokes shift (Δλ = 324 nm in ethanol) and excellent blood-brain barrier permeability. Notably, using WAPP-4, we achieved in vivo 3D dynamic imaging of Aβ plaques in the brains of living mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, super-resolution imaging showed that WAPP-4 could effectively characterize the distribution and shape of Aβ plaques in isolated brain slices. This study demonstrates that newly developed fluorescent dyes with large Stokes shifts and blood-brain barrier permeability enable real-time imaging of amyloid plaques, which will contribute to the development of other valuable tools for near-infrared imaging and super-resolution imaging in the brain.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Blood-brain barrier; Large Stokes shift; Near-infrared; Two-photon probe,"Animals; Mice; Fluorescent Dyes; Plaque, Amyloid; Biosensing Techniques; Brain; Blood-Brain Barrier; Polyvinyl Chloride","Wang, X; Liu, Y; Wang, X; Ye, X; Cheng, W; Chen, G; Zhu, HL; Zhao, J; Qian, Y"
Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers are associated with cognitive function and dementia: Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.,"Inflammatory protein biomarkers induced by immune responses have been associated with cognitive decline and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate associations between a panel of inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive function and incident dementia outcomes in the well-characterized Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. Participants aged ≥40 years and dementia-free at Exam 7 who had a stored plasma sample were selected for profiling using the OLINK proteomics inflammation panel. Cross-sectional associations of the biomarkers with cognitive domain scores (N = 708, 53% female, 22% apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers, 15% APOE ε2 carriers, mean age 61) and incident all-cause and AD dementia during up to 20 years of follow-up were tested. APOE genotype-stratified analyses were performed to explore effect modification. Higher levels of 12 and 3 proteins were associated with worse executive function and language domain factor scores, respectively. Several proteins were associated with more than one cognitive domain, including IL10, LIF-R, TWEAK, CCL19, IL-17C, MCP-4, and TGF-alpha. Stratified analyses suggested differential effects between APOE ε2 and ε4 carriers: most ε4 carrier associations were with executive function and memory domains, whereas most ε2 associations were with the visuospatial domain. Higher levels of TNFB and CDCP1 were associated with higher risks of incident all-cause and AD dementia. Our study found that TWEAK concentration was associated both with cognitive function and risks for AD dementia.

Systemic alterations of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in Alzheimer's disease.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction, especially tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle arrest, is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, its systemic alterations in the central and peripheral of AD patients are not well defined. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of AD brain and peripheral blood cells transcriptomics to reveal the expression levels of nine TCA cycle enzymes involving 35 genes. The results showed that TCA cycle related genes were consistently down-regulated in the AD brain, whereas 11 genes were increased and 16 genes were decreased in the peripheral system. Pearson analysis of the TCA cycle genes with Aβ, Tau and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) revealed several significant correlated genes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunit (PDHB), isocitrate dehydrogenase subunits (IDH3B, IDH3G), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex subunit (DLD), succinyl-CoA synthetase subunit (SUCLA2), malate dehydrogenase subunit (MDH1). In addition, SUCLA2, MDH1, and PDHB were also uniformly down-regulated in peripheral blood cells, suggesting that they may be candidate biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.

"Triangulating brain alterations in anorexia nervosa: a multimodal investigation of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, morphometry and blood-based biomarkers.","The acute state of anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with widespread reductions in cortical gray matter (GM) thickness and white matter (WM) volume, suspected changes in myelin content and elevated levels of the neuronal damage marker neurofilament light (NF-L), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. To gain a deeper understanding of brain changes in AN, we applied a multimodal approach combining advanced neuroimaging methods with analysis of blood-derived biomarkers. In addition to standard measures of cortical GM thickness and WM volume, we analyzed tissue-specific profiles of brain metabolites using multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, T1 relaxation time as a proxy of myelin content leveraging advanced quantitative MRI methods and serum NF-L concentrations in a sample of 30 female, predominately adolescent patients with AN and 30 age-matched female healthy control participants. In patients with AN, we found a reduction in GM cortical thickness and GM total N-acetyl aspartate. The latter predicted higher NF-L levels, which were elevated in AN. Furthermore, GM total choline was elevated. In WM, there were no group differences in either imaging markers, choline levels or N-acetyl aspartate levels. The current study provides evidence for neuronal damage processes as well as for increased membrane lipid catabolism and turnover in GM in acute AN but no evidence for WM pathology.

Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction and Aβ42/40 Ratio Dose-Dependent Modulation with the ApoE Genotype within the ATN Framework.,"The definition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) now considers the presence of the markers of amyloid (A), tau deposition (T), and neurodegeneration (N) essential for diagnosis. AD patients have been reported to have increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, but that has not been tested within the ATN framework so far. As the field is moving towards the use of blood-based biomarkers, the relationship between BBB disruption and AD-specific biomarkers requires considerable attention. Moreover, other factors have been previously implicated in modulating BBB permeability, including age, gender, and ApoE status. A total of 172 cognitively impaired individuals underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for AD biomarkers, and data on BBB dysfunction, demographics, and ApoE status were collected. Our data showed that there was no difference in BBB dysfunction across different ATN subtypes, and that BBB damage was not correlated with cognitive impairment. However, patients with BBB disruption, if measured with a high Qalb, had low Aβ40 levels. ApoE status did not affect BBB function but had a dose-dependent effect on the Aβ42/40 ratio. These results might highlight the importance of understanding dynamic changes across the BBB in future studies in patients with AD.",2023,ATN; Alzheimer’s disease; ApoE; Aβ amyloid; blood–brain barrier,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoproteins E; Biomarkers; Blood-Brain Barrier; Cognitive Dysfunction; Genotype; Peptide Fragments; tau Proteins,"Toniolo, S; Di Lorenzo, F; Bernardini, S; Mercuri, NB; Sancesario, GM"

Sex differences in metabolic phenotype and hypothalamic inflammation in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is notably associated with cognitive decline resulting from impaired function of hippocampal and cortical areas; however, several other domains and corresponding brain regions are affected. One such brain region is the hypothalamus, shown to atrophy and develop amyloid and tau pathology in AD patients. The hypothalamus controls several functions necessary for survival, including energy and glucose homeostasis. Changes in appetite and body weight are common in AD, often seen several years prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms. Therefore, altered metabolic processes may serve as a biomarker for AD, as well as a target for treatment, considering they are likely both a result of pathological changes and contributor to disease progression. Previously, we reported sexually dimorphic metabolic disturbances in ~ 7-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, accompanied by differences in systemic and hypothalamic inflammation.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Gender; Hypothalamus; Inflammation; Metabolic; Sex,"Mice; Female; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Sex Characteristics; tau Proteins; Mice, Transgenic; Hypothalamus; Phenotype; Inflammation; Glucose","Robison, LS; Gannon, OJ; Salinero, AE; Abi-Ghanem, C; Kelly, RD; Riccio, DA; Mansour, FM; Zuloaga, KL"
Methods to Discover and Validate Biofluid-Based Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Dementias.,"Neurodegenerative dementias are progressive diseases that cause neuronal network breakdown in different brain regions often because of accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain extracellular matrix, such as amyloids or inside neurons or other cell types of the brain. Several diagnostic protein biomarkers in body fluids are being used and implemented, such as for Alzheimer's disease. However, there is still a lack of biomarkers for co-pathologies and other causes of dementia. Such biofluid-based biomarkers enable precision medicine approaches for diagnosis and treatment, allow to learn more about underlying disease processes, and facilitate the development of patient inclusion and evaluation tools in clinical trials. When designing studies to discover novel biofluid-based biomarkers, choice of technology is an important starting point. But there are so many technologies to choose among. To address this, we here review the technologies that are currently available in research settings and, in some cases, in clinical laboratory practice. This presents a form of lexicon on each technology addressing its use in research and clinics, its strengths and limitations, and a future perspective.",2023,biomarkers; blood; cerebrospinal fluid; immunoassays; mass-spectrometry; protein detection; validation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Biomarkers; Neurons; Precision Medicine; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Teunissen, CE; Kimble, L; Bayoumy, S; Bolsewig, K; Burtscher, F; Coppens, S; Das, S; Gogishvili, D; Fernandes Gomes, B; Gómez de San José, N; Mavrina, E; Meda, FJ; Mohaupt, P; Mravinacová, S; Waury, K; Wojdała, AL; Abeln, S; Chiasserini, D; Hirtz, C; Gaetani, L; Vermunt, L; Bellomo, G; Halbgebauer, S; Lehmann, S; Månberg, A; Nilsson, P; Otto, M; Vanmechelen, E; Verberk, IMW; Willemse, E; Zetterberg, H"

Tear biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease screening and diagnosis (the TearAD study): design and rationale of an observational longitudinal multicenter study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and due to increasing life expectancy the number of patients is expected to grow. The diagnosis of AD involves the use of biomarkers determined by an amyloid PET scan or cerebrospinal fluid analyses that are either invasive or expensive, and not available in each hospital, thus limiting their usage as a front-line screener. The TearAD study aims to use tear fluid as a potential source for AD biomarkers. In previous reports, we demonstrated that AD biomarkers amyloid-beta and tau, are measurable in tear fluid and are associated with disease severity and neurodegeration. This study aims to validate previous results in a larger cohort and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of tear biomarkers to discriminate between individuals with and without neurodegeneration as determined by hippocampal atrophy.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta; Biomarkers; Cognition; Dementia; Neurofibrillary tangles; Retinal nerve fiber layer; Tear fluid,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Macular Pigment; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"van de Sande, N; Ramakers, IHGB; Visser, PJ; Verhey, FRJ; Verbraak, FD; Bouwman, FH; Berendschot, TTJM; Nuijts, RMMA; Webers, CAB; Gijs, M"
The potential of blood neurofilament light as a marker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease.,"Over the past several years, there has been a surge in blood biomarker studies examining the value of plasma or serum neurofilament light (NfL) as a biomarker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease. However, there have been limited efforts to combine existing findings to assess the utility of blood NfL as a biomarker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we still need better insight into the specific aspects of neurodegeneration that are reflected by the elevated plasma or serum concentration of NfL. In this review, we survey the literature on the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between blood-based NfL levels and other, neuroimaging-based, indices of neurodegeneration in individuals on the Alzheimer's continuum. Then, based on the biomarker classification established by the FDA-NIH Biomarker Working group, we determine the utility of blood-based NfL as a marker for monitoring the disease status (i.e. monitoring biomarker) and predicting the severity of neurodegeneration in older adults with and without cognitive decline (i.e. a prognostic or a risk/susceptibility biomarker). The current findings suggest that blood NfL exhibits great promise as a monitoring biomarker because an increased NfL level in plasma or serum appears to reflect the current severity of atrophy, hypometabolism and the decline of white matter integrity, particularly in the brain regions typically affected by Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal evidence indicates that blood NfL can be useful not only as a prognostic biomarker for predicting the progression of neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease but also as a susceptibility/risk biomarker predicting the likelihood of abnormal alterations in brain structure and function in cognitively unimpaired individuals with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (e.g. those with a higher amyloid-β). There are still limitations to current research, as discussed in this review. Nevertheless, the extant literature strongly suggests that blood NfL can serve as a valuable prognostic and susceptibility biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration in clinical settings, as well as in research settings.",2024,atrophy; dementia; glucose metabolism; white matter microstructure,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofilament Proteins; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Jung, Y; Damoiseaux, JS"
[How Helpful are Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for the Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease?].,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies on imaging and fluid biomarkers to objectively detect and quantitatively evaluate brain AD pathologies. Amyloid- and tau-PET scans recently enabled clinicians to make definitive diagnoses based on abnormal amyloid/tau deposition in the human brain. Since PET scans and blood-based biomarkers are mutually complementary, the identification of suitable blood-based biomarkers is essential for screening brain AD pathologies. According to the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) Research Framework published in 2018, AD is defined by its underlying pathologic processes, which can be diagnosed in vivo using suitable biomarkers. These biomarkers are categorized under the ATN classification system, including β amyloid deposition (A), pathologic tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N). Originally, all the ATN fluid biomarkers were assessed using cerebrospinal fluid, but currently these biomarkers can be quantified using blood samples. Among those blood-based ATN biomarkers, the plasma levels of Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) representing ""A,"" ""T,"" and ""N"" biomarkers, respectively, are useful in the early diagnosis of AD. However, further studies and additional data are required before utilizing these blood-based biomarkers as stand-alone diagnostic markers for AD.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Early Diagnosis; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Tokuda, T"
A FinnGen pilot clinical recall study for Alzheimer's disease.,"Successful development of novel therapies requires that clinical trials are conducted in patient cohorts with the highest benefit-to-risk ratio. Population-based biobanks with comprehensive health and genetic data from large numbers of individuals hold promise to facilitate identification of trial participants, particularly when interventions need to start while symptoms are still mild, such as for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study describes a process for clinical recall studies from FinnGen. We demonstrate the feasibility to systematically ascertain customized clinical data from FinnGen participants with ICD10 diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive disorder (MCD) in a single-center cross-sectional study testing blood-based biomarkers and cognitive functioning in-person, computer-based and remote. As a result, 19% (27/140) of a pre-specified FinnGen subcohort were successfully recalled and completed the study. Hospital records largely validated registry entries. For 8/12 MCD patients, other reasons than AD were identified as underlying diagnosis. Cognitive measures correlated across platforms, with highest consistencies for dementia screening (r = 0.818) and semantic fluency (r = 0.764), respectively, for in-person versus telephone-administered tests. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (p < 0.002) and phosphorylated-tau 181 (pTau-181) (p < 0.020) most reliably differentiated AD from MCD participants.

The emerging role of exosomes in Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ), a serious mental disorder, is one of the leading causes of disease burden worldwide. Exosomes, as a natural nanocarrier, are able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and play a key bridging role in central nervous system (CNS) communication, participating in important physiological processes such as neural regeneration, prominent plasticity, axonal support, and neuroinflammation. In recent years, exosomes have received widespread attention in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease. However, there are few reviews on exosomes and SCZ. Therefore, we conducted a literature search in PubMed and Web of Science using the following search terms: ""schizophrenia"", ""mental disorder"", ""central system"", ""exosome"", ""extracellular vesicles"" to identify publications from January 2010 to December 2022. Our review summarized exosomes secreted by different cell types in the CNS and the double-edged role of exosomes in the development of SCZ, and discussed their future potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In conclusion, this article provides an up-to-date overview of the current research on the involvement of exosomes in SCZ, while also highlighting the challenges that are currently faced in this field.",2023,Blood-brain barrier; Exosomes; Schizophrenia,Humans; Schizophrenia; Exosomes; Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Psychotic Disorders,"Dai, J; Zhang, MZ; He, QQ; Chen, R"

Near-Infrared Bodipy-Based Molecular Rotors for β-Amyloid Imaging In Vivo.,"β-amyloid (Aβ) is one of the important biomarkers for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many near-infrared probes based on the donor-π-acceptor structure have been developed to detect Aβ. Most reported Aβ probes are based on the N,N-dimethylamino group as the ideal donor, which is a widely accepted binding unit. As such, the development of fluorescent probes with improved binding units to detect Aβ is urgently required. Therefore, with this research three anchoring molecular rotor electron donors consisting of cyclic amines of different ring sizes are developed, namely five-membered ring (TPyr), six-membered ring (TPip), and seven-membered ring (THAI). These new anchored molecular rotors are connected to a 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) and named TPyrBDP, TPipBDP, and THAIBDP.

By characterizing the excitation wavelength and emission wavelength, the imaging characteristics of the investigation in the near-infrared light region were determined; with an increase in the concentration of the probe compounds, the fluorescence intensity showed an upward trend, demonstrating ideal optical characteristics. In vivo, imaging results showed that the synthesized probe compounds could penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and specifically bind to Aβ in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Especially for compound 3b, the maximum emission wavelength was around 667 nm, and the fluorescence signal intensity in the brain of the APP/PS1 mice model was more than twice that of the wild control group at 120 min after administration, which could display Aβ pathological changes.

The performance of plasma phosphorylated tau231 in detecting Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau231 (P-tau231) is associated with neuropathological outcomes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The invasive access of cerebrospinal fluid has greatly stimulated interest in the identification of blood-based P-tau231, and the recent advent of single-molecule array assay for the quantification of plasma P-tau231 may provide a turning point to evaluate the usefulness of P-tau231 as an AD-related biomarker. Yet, in the plasma P-tau231 literature, findings with regard to its diagnostic utility have been inconsistent, and thus, we aimed to statistically investigate the potential of plasma P-tau231 in the context of AD via meta-analysis. Publications on plasma P-tau231 were systematically retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and Web of Science databases. A total of 10 studies covering 2007 participants were included, and we conducted random-effect or fixed-effect meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis using the STATA SE 14.0 software. According to our quantitative integration, plasma P-tau231 increased from cognitively unimpaired (CU) populations to mild cognitive impairment to AD and showed significant changes in pairwise comparisons of AD, mild cognitive impairment and CU. Plasma P-tau231 level was significantly higher in CU controls with positive amyloid-β (Aβ) status compared with Aβ-negative CU group. Additionally, the excellent diagnostic accuracy of plasma P-tau231 for asymptomatic Aβ pathology was verified by the pooled value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (standard mean difference [95% confidence interval]: .75 [.69, .81], P < 0.00001).

Amyloid and tau pathology are associated with cerebral blood flow in a mixed sample of nondemented older adults with and without vascular risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.,"Identification of biomarkers for the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an imperative step in developing effective treatments. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is a potential early biomarker for AD; generally, older adults with AD have decreased CBF compared to normally aging peers. CBF deviates as the disease process and symptoms progress. However, further characterization of the relationships between CBF and AD risk factors and pathologies is still needed. We assessed the relationships between CBF quantified by arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging, hypertension, APOEε4, and tau and amyloid positron emission tomography in 77 older adults: cognitively normal, subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment. Tau and amyloid aggregation were related to altered CBF, and some of these relationships were dependent on hypertension or APOEε4 status.

Changes in miR-134-3p expression and zDHHC3-AMPARs axis in association with aluminum neurotoxicity.,"Aluminum (Al) is a neurotoxic substance associated with cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanisms for aluminum neurotoxicity remain to be identified. In this work, we try to investigate a novel potential biomarker of cognitive dysfunction following aluminum exposure and the mechanism involved. Recently, miR-134-3p was reported as a novel regulator of cognitive function. To address this, we investigate the expression level of miR-134-3p in plasma from 280 aluminum factory workers and analyzed the correlation between miRNA-134-3p, blood Al concentration, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA scale) score. The results implied that occupational aluminum exposure elevated miR-134-3p expression in the plasma of workers accompanied by cognitive impairment. Our experiment studies using both animal models and PC12 cells validated the upregulation of miR-134-3p caused by aluminum. In addition, we identified that palmitoylation enzyme zDHHC3 was the target of miR-134-3p, and the decreasing AMPAR receptor (AMPAR) trafficking was related to the learning and memory impairment induced by aluminum. More importantly, using transfection and interference approaches in PC12 cells, inhibition of miR-134-3p resulted in a recovery of zDHHC3-AMPARs axis to a certain extent in response to aluminum. In summary, miR-134-3p was found to be involved in aluminum neurotoxicity by targeting zDHHC3-AMPARs axis and could serve as a potential biomarker or helpful target.",2023,AMPA receptor; Aluminum; Cognitive impairment; Neurotoxicity; microRNA-134-3p; zDHHC3,Rats; Animals; MicroRNAs; Aluminum; Up-Regulation; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Song, J; Li, W; Yuan, C; Gao, T; Lu, X; Wang, L; Niu, Q"

Plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies.,"Blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may allow for the early detection of AD pathology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (MCI-AD) and as a co-pathology in MCI with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB). However not all cases of MCI-LB will feature AD pathology. Disease-general biomarkers of neurodegeneration, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or neurofilament light (NfL), may therefore provide a useful supplement to AD biomarkers.

The role of exosomes in adult neurogenesis: implications for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Exosomes are cup-shaped extracellular vesicles with a lipid bilayer that is approximately 30 to 200 nm in thickness. Exosomes are widely distributed in a range of body fluids, including urine, blood, milk, and saliva. Exosomes exert biological function by transporting factors between different cells and by regulating biological pathways in recipient cells. As an important form of intercellular communication, exosomes are increasingly being investigated due to their ability to transfer bioactive molecules such as lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs between cells, and because they can regulate physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system. Adult neurogenesis is a multistage process by which new neurons are generated and migrate to be integrated into existing neuronal circuits. In the adult brain, neurogenesis is mainly localized in two specialized niches: the subventricular zone adjacent to the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. An increasing body of evidence indicates that adult neurogenesis is tightly controlled by environmental conditions with the niches. In recent studies, exosomes released from different sources of cells were shown to play an active role in regulating neurogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, thereby participating in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders in patients and in various disease models. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art synopsis of existing research that aimed to identify the diverse components of exosome cargoes and elucidate the therapeutic potential of exosomal contents in the regulation of neurogenesis in several neurodegenerative diseases. We emphasize that exosomal cargoes could serve as a potential biomarker to monitor functional neurogenesis in adults. In addition, exosomes can also be considered as a novel therapeutic approach to treat various neurodegenerative disorders by improving endogenous neurogenesis to mitigate neuronal loss in the central nervous system.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Huntington’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; adult neurogenesis; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; exosome; neurodegenerative disease; neurogenic niches,,"Yu, Z; Teng, Y; Yang, J; Yang, L"

Co-administration of Nanowired Oxiracetam and Neprilysin with Monoclonal Antibodies to Amyloid Beta Peptide and p-Tau Thwarted Exacerbation of Brain Pathology in Concussive Head Injury at Hot Environment.,"Environmental temperature adversely affects the outcome of concussive head injury (CHI)-induced brain pathology. Studies from our laboratory showed that animals reared at either cold environment or at hot environment exacerbate brain pathology following CHI. Our previous experiments showed that nanowired delivery of oxiracetam significantly attenuated CHI-induced brain pathology and associated neurovascular changes. Military personnel are the most susceptible to CHI caused by explosion, blasts, missile or blunt head trauma leading to lifetime functional and cognitive impairments affecting the quality of life. Severe CHI leads to instant death and/or lifetime paralysis. Military personnel engaged in combat operations are often subjected to extreme high or low environmental temperature zones across the globe. Thus, further exploration of novel therapeutic agents at cold or hot ambient temperatures following CHI are the need of the hour. CHI is also a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease by enhancing amyloid beta peptide deposits in the brain. In this review, effect of hot environment on CHI-induced brain pathology is discussed. In addition, whether nanodelivery of oxiracetam together with neprilysin and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to amyloid beta peptide and p-tau could lead to superior neuroprotection in CHI is explored.

Saliva: a challenging human fluid to diagnose brain disorders with a focus on Alzheimer's disease.,"Biomarkers are molecules of biological processes that help in both the diagnosis of human diseases and in follow-up assessments of therapeutic responses. Biomarkers can be measured in many human fluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva. The -omics methods (genomics, RNomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are useful at measuring thousands of markers in a small volume. Saliva is a human fluid that is easily accessible, without any ethical concerns. Yet, saliva remains unexplored in regard to many human disease biomarkers. In this review, we will give an overview on saliva and how it can be influenced by exogenous factors. As we focus on the potential use of saliva as a diagnostic tool in brain disorders (especially Alzheimer's disease), we will cover how saliva is linked to the brain.

The QPLEX™ Plus Assay Kit for the Early Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"We recently developed a multiplex diagnostic kit, QPLEX™ Alz plus assay kit, which captures amyloid-β1-40, galectin-3 binding protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and periostin simultaneously using microliters of peripheral blood and utilizes an optimized algorithm for screening Alzheimer's disease (AD) by correlating with cerebral amyloid deposition. Owing to the demand for early AD detection, we investigate the potential of our kit for the early clinical diagnosis of AD. A total of 1395 participants were recruited, and their blood samples were analyzed with the QPLEX™ kit. The average of QPLEX™ algorithm values in each group increased gradually in the order of the clinical progression continuum of AD: cognitively normal (0.382 ± 0.150), subjective cognitive decline (0.452 ± 0.130), mild cognitive impairment (0.484 ± 0.129), and AD (0.513 ± 0.136). The algorithm values between each group showed statistically significant differences among groups divided by Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating. The QPLEX™ algorithm values could be used to distinguish the clinical continuum of AD or cognitive function. Because blood-based diagnosis is more accessible, convenient, and cost- and time-effective than cerebral spinal fluid or positron emission tomography imaging-based diagnosis, the QPLEX™ kit can potentially be used for health checkups and the early clinical diagnosis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; algorithm; cognition; dementia; early diagnosis; peripheral blood,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Disease Progression,"Na, H; Shin, KY; Lee, D; Yoon, C; Han, SH; Park, JC; Mook-Jung, I; Jang, J; Kwon, S"
TNAP and P2X7R: New Plasma Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Over the last few years, intense research efforts have been made to anticipate or improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by detecting blood biomarkers. However, the most promising blood biomarkers identified to date have some limitations, most of them related to the techniques required for their detection. Hence, new blood biomarkers should be identified to improve the diagnosis of AD, better discriminate between AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and identify cognitively unimpaired (CU) older individuals at risk for progression to AD. Our previous studies demonstrated that both the purinergic receptor P2X7 and the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ectoenzyme (TNAP) are upregulated in the brains of AD patients. Since both proteins are also present in plasma, we investigated whether plasma P2X7R and TNAP are altered in MCI and AD patients and, if so, their potential role as AD biomarkers. We found that AD but not MCI patients present increased plasma P2X7R levels. Nevertheless, TNAP plasma activity was increased in MCI patients and decreased in the AD group. ROC curve analysis indicated that measuring both parameters has a reasonable discriminating capability to diagnose MCI and AD conditions. In addition to confirming that individuals progressing to MCI have increased TNAP activity in plasma, longitudinal studies also revealed that CU individuals have lower plasma TNAP activity than stable controls. Thus, we propose that P2X7 and TNAP could serve as new plasma biomarkers for MCI and AD.",2023,Alzheimer; P2X7R; TNAP; biomarker,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Alkaline Phosphatase; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Longitudinal Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Progression; tau Proteins,"Aivar, P; Bianchi, C; Di Lauro, C; Soria-Tobar, L; Alvarez-Castelao, B; Calero, M; Medina, M; Diaz-Hernandez, M"
Central and Peripheral Inflammation in Mild Cognitive Impairment in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by an abnormal decline in mental and cognitive function compared with normal cognitive aging. It is an underlying condition of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. In recent years, neuroinflammation has been investigated as a new leading target that contributes to MCI progression into AD. Understanding the mechanism underlying inflammatory processes involved in the early onset of the disease could help find a safe and effective way to diagnose and treat patients. In this article, we assessed over twenty different blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory biomarker concentrations with immunoassay methods in patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment), non-impaired control (NIC), and serum healthy control (HC). We performed group comparisons and analyzed in-group correlations between the biomarkers. We included 107 participants (mean age: 64.7 ± 7.8, women: 58.9%).

Peripherin is a biomarker of axonal damage in peripheral nervous system disease.,"Valid, responsive blood biomarkers specific to peripheral nerve damage would improve management of peripheral nervous system (PNS) diseases. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is sensitive for detecting axonal pathology but is not specific to PNS damage, as it is expressed throughout the PNS and CNS. Peripherin, another intermediate filament protein, is almost exclusively expressed in peripheral nerve axons. We postulated that peripherin would be a promising blood biomarker of PNS axonal damage. We demonstrated that peripherin is distributed in sciatic nerve, and to a lesser extent spinal cord tissue lysates, but not in brain or extra-neural tissues. In the spinal cord, anti-peripherin antibody bound only to the primary cells of the periphery (anterior horn cells, motor axons and primary afferent sensory axons). In vitro models of antibody-mediated axonal and demyelinating nerve injury showed marked elevation of peripherin levels only in axonal damage and only a minimal rise in demyelination. We developed an immunoassay using single molecule array technology for the detection of serum peripherin as a biomarker for PNS axonal damage. We examined longitudinal serum peripherin and NfL concentrations in individuals with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS, n = 45, 179 time points), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP, n = 35, 70 time points), multiple sclerosis (n = 30), dementia (as non-inflammatory CNS controls, n = 30) and healthy individuals (n = 24). Peak peripherin levels were higher in GBS than all other groups (median 18.75 pg/ml versus < 6.98 pg/ml, P < 0.0001). Peak NfL was highest in GBS (median 220.8 pg/ml) and lowest in healthy controls (median 5.6 pg/ml), but NfL did not distinguish between CIDP (17.3 pg/ml), multiple sclerosis (21.5 pg/ml) and dementia (29.9 pg/ml). While peak NfL levels were higher with older age (rho = +0.39, P < 0.0001), peak peripherin levels did not vary with age. In GBS, local regression analysis of serial peripherin in the majority of individuals with three or more time points of data (16/25) displayed a rise-and-fall pattern with the highest value within the first week of initial assessment.

The hidden players: Shedding light on the significance of post-translational modifications and miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease development.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent, expensive, lethal, and burdening neurodegenerative disease of this century. The initial stages of this disease are characterized by a reduced ability to encode and store new memories. Subsequent cognitive and behavioral deterioration occurs during the later stages. Abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) resulting in amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation along with hyperphosphorylation of tau protein are the two characteristic hallmarks of AD. Recently, several post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been identified on both Aβ as well as tau proteins. However, a complete understanding of how different PTMs influence the structure and function of proteins in both healthy and diseased conditions is still lacking. It has been speculated that these PTMs might play vital roles in the progression of AD. In addition, several short non-coding microRNA (miRNA) sequences have been found to be deregulated in the peripheral blood of Alzheimer patients. The miRNAs are single-stranded RNAs that control gene expression by causing mRNA degradation, deadenylation, or translational repression and have been implicated in the regulation of several neuronal and glial activities. The lack of comprehensive understanding regarding disease mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets greatly hampers the development of effective strategies for early diagnosis and the identification of viable therapeutic targets. Moreover, existing treatment options for managing the disease have proven to be ineffective and provide only temporary relief. Therefore, understanding the role of miRNAs and PTMs in AD can provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms, aid in the identification of biomarkers, facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, and inspire innovative treatments for this challenging condition.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid-β; MiRNAs; Neurodegeneration; Post-translational modifications; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; MicroRNAs; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Biomarkers","Singh, R; Hussain, J; Kaur, A; Jamdare, BG; Pathak, D; Garg, K; Kaur, R; Shankar, S; Sunkaria, A"

Benzenesulfonamide, a novel, potent, and small organic molecule, was synthesized to investigate its effects on the levels of oxidative biomarkers (GPx, ROS, and MDA) and expression of beta-amyloid peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) in the pathology of AD. The results were compared with the rivastigmine drug. Applying benzenesulfonamide to Alzheimer's-induced Wistar rats showed a significant increase in the level of oxidative biomarkers (GPx, ROS, and MDA) in both the brain and blood serum as well as amyloid-β40 and 42 gene expressions. Therefore, benzenesulfonamide could be considered a novel therapeutic agent against AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-β; Aβ gene expression; Benzenesulfonamide; Oxidative stress,"Animals; Rats; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Gene Expression; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Oxidative Stress; Peptide Fragments; Rats, Wistar; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sulfonamides; Benzenesulfonamides","Hesar Shourkabi, M; Ghobeh, M; Jafary, H"

Macrophage lineage cells-derived migrasomes activate complement-dependent blood-brain barrier damage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy mouse model.,"Accumulation of amyloid beta protein (Aβ) in brain vessels damages blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Macrophage lineage cells scavenge Aβ and produce disease-modifying mediators. Herein, we report that Aβ40-induced macrophage-derived migrasomes are sticky to blood vessels in skin biopsy samples from CAA patients and brain tissue from CAA mouse models (Tg-SwDI/B and 5xFAD mice). We show that CD5L is packed in migrasomes and docked to blood vessels, and that enrichment of CD5L impairs the resistance to complement activation. Increased migrasome-producing capacity of macrophages and membrane attack complex (MAC) in blood are associated with disease severity in both patients and Tg-SwDI/B mice. Of note, complement inhibitory treatment protects against migrasomes-mediated blood-brain barrier injury in Tg-SwDI/B mice. We thus propose that macrophage-derived migrasomes and the consequent complement activation are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CAA.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Blood-Brain Barrier; Mice, Transgenic; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Brain; Macrophages; Alzheimer Disease","Hu, M; Li, T; Ma, X; Liu, S; Li, C; Huang, Z; Lin, Y; Wu, R; Wang, S; Lu, D; Lu, T; Men, X; Shen, S; Huang, H; Liu, Y; Song, K; Jian, B; Jiang, Y; Qiu, W; Liu, Q; Lu, Z; Cai, W"
HLA-A23/HLA-A24 serotypes and dementia interaction in the elderly: Association with increased soluble HLA class I molecules in plasma.,"MHC class I molecules regulate brain development and plasticity in mice and HLA class I molecules are associated with brain disorders in humans.

A cohort of HLA class I serotyped elderly subjects with no dementia/pre-dementia (NpD, n = 28), or with dementia (D, n = 28) was studied. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the influence of dementia and HLA class I serotype on sHLA class I levels, and to compare sHLA class I within four groups according to the presence or absence of HLA-A23/A24 and dementia. HLA-A23/A24 and dementia, but not age, significantly influenced the level of sHLA class I. Importantly, the concurrent presence of HLA-A23/A24 and dementia was associated with higher levels of sHLA class I (p < 0.001). This study has shown that the simultaneous presence of HLA-A23/HLA-A24 and dementia is associated with high levels of serum sHLA class I molecules. Thus, sHLA class I could be considered a biomarker of neurodegeneration in certain HLA class I carriers.",2023,Alzheimer's; MHC; Parkinson's; biomarkers; dementia; immunoregulation; neurodegeneration; soluble HLA class I,Humans; Animals; Mice; Aged; HLA-A24 Antigen; Serogroup; Alleles; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Dementia,"Cardoso, EM; Lourenço-Gomes, V; Esgalhado, AJ; Reste-Ferreira, D; Oliveira, N; Amaral, AS; Martinho, A; Gama, JMR; Verde, I; Lourenço, O; Fonseca, AM; Buchli, R; Arosa, FA"

Advances in peripheral blood biomarkers of patients with Alzheimer's disease: Moving closer to personalized therapies.,"Recently, measurable peripheral biomarkers in the plasma of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have gained considerable clinical interest. Several studies have identified one or more blood signatures that may facilitate the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. For instance, changes in peripheral amyloid β42 (Aβ42) levels have been largely investigated in patients with AD and correlated with the progression of the pathology, although with controversial results. In addition, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) has been identified as an inflammatory biomarker strongly associated with AD, and several studies have consistently suggested the pharmacological targeting of TNFα to reduce systemic inflammation and prevent neurotoxicity in AD. Moreover, alterations in plasma metabolite levels appear to predict the progression of systemic processes relevant to brain functions. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the levels of Aβ42, TNFα, and plasma metabolites in subjects with AD and compared the results with those in healthy elderly (HE) subjects. Differences in plasma metabolites of patients with AD were analyzed with respect to Aβ42, TNFα, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, searching for plasma signatures that changed simultaneously. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of the Tyr682 residue of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which we previously proposed as a biomarker of AD, were measured in five HE and five AD patients, in whom the levels of Aβ42, TNFα, and two plasma lipid metabolites increased simultaneously. Overall, this study highlights the potential of combining different plasma signatures to define specific clinical phenotypes of patient subgroups, thus paving the way for the stratification of patients with AD and development of personalized approaches.",2023,APP Tyr682; Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ42; Peripheral blood biomarkers; Phosphatidylcholines; Plasma metabolites; TNFα,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Peptide Fragments; tau Proteins,"Ferretti, G; Serafini, S; Angiolillo, A; Monterosso, P; Di Costanzo, A; Matrone, C"

Novel aspects of the phosphorylation and structure of pathological tau: implications for tauopathy biomarkers.,"The deposition of highly phosphorylated and aggregated tau is a characteristic of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. It has long been known that different isoforms of tau are aggregated in different cell types and brain regions in each tauopathy. Recent advances in analytical techniques revealed the details of the biochemical and structural biological differences of tau specific to each tauopathy. In this review, we explain recent advances in the analysis of post-translational modifications of tau, particularly phosphorylation, brought about by the development of mass-spectrometry and Phos-tag technology. We then discuss the structure of tau filaments in each tauopathy revealed by the advent of cryo-EM. Finally, we describe the progress in biofluid and imaging biomarkers for tauopathy.

Metabolic Pathway Pairwise-Based Signature as a Potential Non-Invasive Diagnostic Marker in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Early screening, particularly in blood plasma, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to the diagnosis and prevention of AD. In addition, metabolic dysfunction has been demonstrated to be closely related to AD, which might be reflected in the whole blood transcriptome. Hence, we hypothesized that the establishment of a diagnostic model based on the metabolic signatures of blood is a workable strategy. To that end, we initially constructed metabolic pathway pairwise (MPP) signatures to characterize the interplay among metabolic pathways. Then, a series of bioinformatic methodologies, e.g., differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, network analysis, etc., were used to investigate the molecular mechanism behind AD. Moreover, an unsupervised clustering analysis based on the MPP signature profile via the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm was utilized to stratify AD patients. Finally, aimed at distinguishing AD patients from non-AD groups, a metabolic pathway-pairwise scoring system (MPPSS) was established using multi-machine learning methods. As a result, many metabolic pathways correlated to AD were disclosed, including oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, etc. NMF clustering analysis divided AD patients into two subgroups (S1 and S2), which exhibit distinct activities of metabolism and immunity. Typically, oxidative phosphorylation in S2 exhibits a lower activity than that in S1 and non-AD group, suggesting the patients in S2 might possess a more compromised brain metabolism. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis showed that the patients in S2 might have phenomena of immune suppression compared with S1 and the non-AD group. These findings indicated that S2 probably has a more severe progression of AD. Finally, MPPSS could achieve an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.77) in the training dataset, 0.71 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.77) in the testing dataset, and an AUC of 0.99 (95%CI: 0.96, 1.00) in one external validation dataset. Overall, our study successfully established a novel metabolism-based scoring system for AD diagnosis using the blood transcriptome and provided new insight into the molecular mechanism of metabolic dysfunction implicated in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; metabolic abnormalities; multi-machine learning; noninvasive diagnosis; peripheral blood,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Algorithms; Machine Learning; Cluster Analysis; Metabolic Networks and Pathways,"Feng, Y; Chen, X; Zhang, XD; Huang, C"

Clinical trials in vascular cognitive impairment following SPRINT-MIND: An international perspective.,"A large interventional trial, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial sub-study termed Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (SPRINT-MIND), found reduced risk of cognitive impairment in older adults with intensive, relative to standard, blood-pressure-lowering targets (systolic BP < 120 vs. <140 mm Hg). In this perspective, we discuss key questions and make recommendations for clinical practice and for clinical trials, following SPRINT-MIND. Future trials should embody cognitive endpoints appropriate to the participant group, ideally with adaptive designs that ensure robust answers for cognitive and cardiovascular endpoints. Reliable data from diverse populations, including the oldest-old (age > 80 years), will maximize external validity and global implementation of trial findings. New biomarkers will improve phenotyping to stratify patients to optimal treatments. Currently no antihypertensive drug class stands out for dementia risk reduction. Multi-domain interventions, incorporating lifestyle change (exercise, diet) alongside medications, may maximize global impact. Given the low cost and wide availability of antihypertensive drugs, intensive BP reduction may be a cost-effective means to reduce dementia risk in diverse, aging populations worldwide.",2023,aging; blood pressure; clinical trials; cognitive impairment; dementia; hypertension; prevention; vascular disease,"Humans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Hypertension; Cognitive Dysfunction; Antihypertensive Agents; Dementia; Internationality","Elahi, FM; Alladi, S; Black, SE; Claassen, JAHR; DeCarli, C; Hughes, TM; Moonen, J; Pajewski, NM; Price, BR; Satizabal, C; Shaaban, CE; Silva, NCBS; Snyder, HM; Sveikata, L; Williamson, JD; Wolters, FJ; Hainsworth, AH"
Differential relationships of NMDAR hypofunction and oxidative stress with cognitive decline.,"NMDAR hypofunction and oxidative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) regulates NMDAR function. Glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase are three first-line endogenous antioxidants. This study explored the associations of these potential biomarkers with mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive function and blood levels of DAO, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were measured in 63 mild cognitive impairment patients and 24 healthy individuals every 6 months for 2 years. Among the patients, DAO and glutathione levels at baseline contributed to the cognitive decline 2 years later. Among the healthy individuals, only glutathione levels were associated with cognitive change. The four biomarkers differed in change directions (upward vs. downward) in the patients and in the healthy individuals. Among patients, glutathione levels were negatively correlated with superoxide dismutase and positively correlated with catalase, and DAO levels were negatively correlated with superoxide dismutase. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the differential associations of NMDAR hypofunction and oxidative stress with cognitive change between the mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy people. Glutathione may be regarded as an aging marker for both mild cognitive impairment and normal aging; and DAO, a biomarker exclusively for mild cognitive impairment.",2023,"Antioxidants, Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Biomarker; D-amino acid oxidase (DAO); NMDAR","Humans; Catalase; Cognitive Dysfunction; Oxidative Stress; Biomarkers; Glutathione; Superoxide Dismutase; Alzheimer Disease; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate","Lane, HY; Wang, SH; Lin, CH"

A unique circular RNA expression pattern in the peripheral blood of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome patients.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease with obscure aetiology. The underdiagnosis rate of ME/CFS is high due to the lack of diagnostic criteria based on objective markers. In recent years, circRNAs have emerged as potential genetic biomarkers for neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, making them likely to have the same prospect of being biomarkers in ME/CFS. However, despite the extensive amount of research that has been performed on the transcriptomes of ME/CFS patients, all of them are solely focused on linear RNAs, and the profiling of circRNAs in ME/CFS has been completely omitted. In this study, we investigated the expression profiles of circRNAs, comparing ME/CFS patients and controls before and after two sessions of cardiopulmonary exercise longitudinally. In patients with ME/CFS, the number of detected circRNAs was higher compared to healthy controls, indicating potential differences in circRNA expression associated with the disease. Additionally, healthy controls showed an increase in the number of circRNAs following exercise testing, while no similar pattern was evident in ME/CFS patients, further highlighting physiological differences between the two groups. A lack of correlation was observed between differentially expressed circRNAs and their corresponding coding genes in terms of expression and function, suggesting the potential of circRNAs as independent biomarkers in ME/CFS. Specifically, 14 circRNAs were highly expressed in ME/CFS patients but absent in controls throughout the exercise study, indicating a unique molecular signature specific to ME/CFS patients and providing potential diagnostic biomarkers for the disease. Significant enrichment of protein and gene regulative pathways were detected in relation to five of these 14 circRNAs based on their predicted miRNA target genes. Overall, this is the first study to describe the circRNA expression profile in peripheral blood of ME/CFS patients, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.",2023,Chronic fatigue syndrome; Circular transcriptome profiling; Differential expression; Myalgic encephalomyelitis; circular RNAs,"Humans; Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic; RNA, Circular; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Markers","Cheng, Y; Xu, SM; Takenaka, K; Lindner, G; Curry-Hyde, A; Janitz, M"

Plasma NfL as a prognostic biomarker for enriching HD-ISS stage 1 categorisation: a cross-sectional study.,"The recently proposed Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System (HD-ISS) categorises individuals with the Huntintin genetic mutation into disease progression cohorts based on quantitative neuroimaging, cognitive, and functional markers for research purposes. Unfortunately, many research studies do not collect quantitative neuroimaging data, and so the authors of the HD-ISS have subsequently provided approximated cohort thresholds based on disease and clinical data alone. However, these are rough proxies that aim to maximise stage separation, and should not be considered as 1:1 substitutes for the HD-ISS. Notably, no wet biomarker met the stringent criteria required to be considered a landmark for HD-ISS categorisation. We have previously shown that levels of plasma neurofilament light (NfL), a neuronal marker associated with axonal injury, are associated with predicted years to clinical motor diagnosis (CMD). Our objective in the current study was to determine whether HD-ISS categorisation, particularly for stages prior to CMD, could be improved with consideration of plasma NfL levels.",2023,Biomarkers; Huntington’s disease; Neurofilament light; Plasma,Humans; Huntington Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prognosis; Neurofilament Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers,"Parkin, GM; Thomas, EA; Corey-Bloom, J"

Utility of DNA Methylation as a Biomarker in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have been implicated in a number of diseases including cancer, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. While it is recognized that DNA methylation is tissue-specific, a limitation for many studies is the ability to sample the tissue of interest, which is why there is a need for a proxy tissue such as blood, that is reflective of the methylation state of the target tissue. In the last decade, DNA methylation has been utilized in the design of epigenetic clocks, which aim to predict an individual's biological age based on an algorithmically defined set of CpGs. A number of studies have found associations between disease and/or disease risk with increased biological age, adding weight to the theory of increased biological age being linked with disease processes. Hence, this review takes a closer look at the utility of DNA methylation as a biomarker in aging and disease, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; DNA methylation; dementia; epigenetics,,"Milicic, L; Porter, T; Vacher, M; Laws, SM"

Associations of Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Aβ and tau Levels with Renal Function.,"Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that brain-derived Aβ and tau can be cleared through transport into the periphery, and the kidneys may be vital organs involved in the clearance of Aβ and tau. However, the effects of deficiency in the clearance of Aβ and tau by the kidneys on brain AD-type pathologies in humans remain largely unknown. In this study, we first recruited 41 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 40 age- and sex-matched controls with normal renal function to analyze the associations of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with plasma Aβ and tau levels. To analyze the associations of eGFR with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, we recruited 42 cognitively normal CKD patients and 150 cognitively normal controls with CSF samples. Compared with controls with normal renal function, CKD patients had higher plasma levels of Aβ40, Aβ42 and total tau (T-tau), lower CSF levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 and higher levels of CSF T-tau/Aβ42 and phosphorylated tau (P-tau)/Aβ42. Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and T-tau levels were negatively correlated with eGFR. In addition, eGFR was negatively correlated with CSF levels of T-tau, T-tau/Aβ42, and P-tau/Aβ42 but positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Thus, this study showed that the decline in renal function was correlated with abnormal AD biomarkers and cognitive decline, which provides human evidence that renal function may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive function; Renal function; Tau; β-amyloid,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments; Kidney; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic","Sun, HL; Yao, XQ; Lei, L; Jin, WS; Bai, YD; Zeng, GH; Shi, AY; Liang, J; Zhu, L; Liu, YH; Wang, YJ; Bu, XL"
The Coming of Age of the P2X7 Receptor in Diagnostic Medicine.,"The discovery of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R, originally named P2Z) in immune cells, its cloning, and the identification of its role in a multiplicity of immune-mediated diseases raised great hopes for the development of novel and more potent anti-inflammatory medicaments. Unfortunately, such hopes were partially deluded by the unsatisfactory results of most early clinical trials. This failure substantially reduced the interest of the pharmaceutical and biotech industries in the clinical development of P2X7R-targeted therapies. However, recent findings ushered in a second life for the P2X7R in diagnostic medicine. New P2X7R radioligands proved to be very reliable tools for the diagnosis of neuroinflammation in preclinical and clinical studies, and detection and measurement of free P2X7 receptor (or P2X7 subunit) in human blood suggested its potential use as a circulating marker of inflammation.

Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: Current state and future use in a transformed global healthcare landscape.,"Timely detection of the pathophysiological changes and cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly pressing because of the advent of biomarker-guided targeted therapies that may be most effective when provided early in the disease. Currently, diagnosis and management of early AD are largely guided by clinical symptoms. FDA-approved neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers can aid detection and diagnosis, but the clinical implementation of these testing modalities is limited because of availability, cost, and perceived invasiveness. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) may enable earlier and faster diagnoses as well as aid in risk assessment, early detection, prognosis, and management. Herein, we review data on BBBMs that are closest to clinical implementation, particularly those based on measures of amyloid-β peptides and phosphorylated tau species.

"Location of pathogenic variants in PSEN1 impacts progression of cognitive, clinical, and neurodegenerative measures in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.","Although pathogenic variants in PSEN1 leading to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) are highly penetrant, substantial interindividual variability in the rates of cognitive decline and biomarker change are observed in ADAD. We hypothesized that this interindividual variability may be associated with the location of the pathogenic variant within PSEN1. PSEN1 pathogenic variant carriers participating in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study were grouped based on whether the underlying variant affects a transmembrane (TM) or cytoplasmic (CY) protein domain within PSEN1. CY and TM carriers and variant non-carriers (NC) who completed clinical evaluation, multimodal neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture for collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as part of their participation in DIAN were included in this study. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine differences in clinical, cognitive, and biomarker measures between the NC, TM, and CY groups. While both the CY and TM groups were found to have similarly elevated Aβ compared to NC, TM carriers had greater cognitive impairment, smaller hippocampal volume, and elevated phosphorylated tau levels across the spectrum of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of disease as compared to CY, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. As distinct portions of PSEN1 are differentially involved in APP processing by γ-secretase and the generation of toxic β-amyloid species, these results have important implications for understanding the pathobiology of ADAD and accounting for a substantial portion of the interindividual heterogeneity in ongoing ADAD clinical trials.",2023,PSEN1; Presenilin-1; Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD); heterogeneity; neurodegeneration,Humans; Male; Female; Adult; Brain; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Presenilin-1; Mutation; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Biomarkers,"Schultz, SA; Shirzadi, Z; Schultz, AP; Liu, L; Fitzpatrick, CD; McDade, E; Barthelemy, NR; Renton, A; Esposito, B; Joseph-Mathurin, N; Cruchaga, C; Chen, CD; Goate, A; Allegri, RF; Benzinger, TLS; Berman, S; Chui, HC; Fagan, AM; Farlow, MR; Fox, NC; Gordon, BA; Day, GS; Graff-Radford, NR; Hassenstab, JJ; Hanseeuw, BJ; Hofmann, A; Jack, CR; Jucker, M; Karch, CM; Koeppe, RA; Lee, JH; Levey, AI; Levin, J; Martins, RN; Mori, H; Morris, JC; Noble, J; Perrin, RJ; Rosa-Neto, P; Salloway, SP; Sanchez-Valle, R; Schofield, PR; Xiong, C; Johnson, KA; Bateman, RJ; Sperling, RA; Chhatwal, JP"

Genetic risk scores enhance the diagnostic value of plasma biomarkers of brain amyloidosis.,"Blood-based biomarkers offer strong potential to revolutionize diagnosis, trial enrolment and treatment monitoring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, further advances are needed before these biomarkers can achieve wider deployment beyond selective research studies and specialty memory clinics, including the development of frameworks for optimal interpretation of biomarker profiles. We hypothesized that integrating Alzheimer's disease genetic risk score (AD-GRS) data would enhance the diagnostic value of plasma AD biomarkers by better capturing extant disease heterogeneity. Analysing 962 individuals from a population-based sample, we observed that an AD-GRS was independently associated with amyloid PET levels (an early marker of AD pathophysiology) over and above APOE ε4 or plasma p-tau181, amyloid-β42/40, glial fibrillary acidic protein or neurofilament light chain. Among individuals with a high or moderately high plasma p-tau181, integrating AD-GRS data significantly improved classification accuracy of amyloid PET positivity, including the finding that the combination of a high AD-GRS and high plasma p-tau181 outperformed p-tau181 alone in classifying amyloid PET positivity (88% versus 68%; P = 0.001). A machine learning approach incorporating plasma biomarkers, demographics and the AD-GRS was highly accurate in predicting amyloid PET levels (90% training set; 89% test set) and Shapley value analyses (an explainer method based in cooperative game theory) indicated that the AD-GRS and plasma biomarkers had differential importance in explaining amyloid deposition across individuals.

Association of Telomere Length with Cognitive Impairment.,"Telomere attrition is attributed to Alzheimer's disease (AD), major depressive disorder, stress levels, physical inactivity, short sleep duration, and reduced educational abilities. In this article, we tried to assess the association between the telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes and level of cognitive impairment and its dependence on age and sex. Healthy subjects and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and different AD stages were recruited in the study. All patients were assessed by the same standard diagnostic procedure, including neurological examination-Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Blood samples from 66 subjects (18 men and 48 women, mean age 71.2 ± 0.56 years) were collected for DNA extraction from peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC). Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by monochrome multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The data obtained in the study indicate that RTL in PBMCs has a statistically significant association with MMSE score (p < 0.02). Moreover, the sex-specific difference was observed for the association between telomere length and various parameters of MMSE. Also, it has been found that a decrease in RTL by one unit is associated with an increase in the odds to get AD at a ratio of 2.54 (95% CI, 1.25 to 5.17). The results obtained in this research are in coherence with other studies that telomere length may be a valuable biomarker of cognitive decline. However, the potential need for longitudinal studies of telomere length, in order to estimate the influence of hereditary and environmental factors, remains.",2023,Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; TS ratio,"Male; Humans; Female; Aged; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Depressive Disorder, Major; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Telomere","Diukov, Y; Bachinskaya, N; Dzobak, A; Kholin, V; Kyriachenko, Y; Barsukov, O; Zabuha, O; Krasnienkov, D"

Plasma levels of phosphorylated tau and neurofilament light chain as potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: A biochemical analysis in Pakistani population.,"The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association's research framework in 2018 proposed a molecular construct for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, the clinical exclusionary strategy is still the mainstay of AD diagnosis in Pakistan. We looked at the plasma levels of amyloid beta-42 (Aβ-42), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and neurofilament light (NFL) in patients with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) and healthy controls (HC) from the Pakistani population to keep pace with the global efforts towards establishing accessible and affordable biochemical diagnostic markers for AD in Pakistan. Consultant neurologists screened patients who presented with cognitive impairment to three large tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, and after receiving informed consent, recruited participants with ACS and HC from the same facilities. We collected 5cc of blood in EDTA tubes along with demographic and lifestyle information of the subjects. Plasma aliquots were stored at -80°C after centrifugation. For analysis it was thawed at 4℃ and levels of the three proteins were measured through ELISA. Data from 28 ACS patients and 28 age matched healthy controls were evaluated.

How can platelet proteomics best be used to interrogate disease?,"Various modifications of proteins and the resulting proteoforms of a protein can associate with many diseases and are also significantly involved in the rapid regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. For example, the release of prostacyclin from the intact endothelium and the consequent following phosphorylation of VASP in platelets is a post-translational regulation to keep them in a quiescent state. In Alzheimer's disease, proteoforms arise from the altered cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, which finally causes amyloid plaques in the brain. This changed processing of the amyloid precursor protein can also be detected in platelets, making them an attractive source of biomarkers for this neurodegenerative disease. Age-related or prothrombotic disorders can have multiple origins, including genomic, transcriptional, and translational factors, which together can be mapped at the proteome level. Hence, recording these dynamic protein changes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions is paramount in platelet proteomics. To effectively study diseases through platelet proteomics, it is crucial to consider platelets' primary regulatory mechanism and thoroughly evaluate the disparities between the two leading proteomics technologies, top-down and bottom-up approaches. This commentary provides insights into the differences between these two technologies, which are particularly noticeable in detecting the different proteoforms of a protein.",2023,,"Humans; Proteomics; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Blood Platelets; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteome","Zellner, M"

Assessing farmer's exposure to pesticides and the risk for non-communicable diseases: A biomonitoring study.,"This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the adverse effects of pesticide use in humans, such as non-communicable diseases, using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and pesticide concentrations in blood samples. A total of 353 samples (290 case and 63 control) were collected from participants with >20 years of experience in agricultural pesticide use. The pesticide and AChE concentrations were determined using Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). Various health risks from pesticide exposure were assessed, including dizziness or headache, tension, anxiety, confusion, loss of appetite, loss of balance, concentration difficulties, irritability, anger, and depression. These risks may be influenced by the duration and intensity of exposure, the type of pesticide, and environmental factors in the affected areas. A total of 26 pesticides were detected in the blood samples from the exposed population, including 16 insecticides, three fungicides, and seven herbicides. Pesticide concentrations ranged from 0.20 to 12.12 ng/mL, and were statistically significant between the case and control groups (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001). A correlation analysis was performed to determine statistically significance between pesticide concentration and symptoms of non-communicable diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, obesity, and diabetes. The estimated AChE levels in case and control blood samples were 21.58 ± 2.31 and 24.13 ± 1.08 U/mL, respectively (mean ± SD). The AChE levels were significantly lower in case samples than in controls (p < 0.001), which is considered to be an effect of long-term pesticide exposure, and is the cause of Alzheimer's disease (p < 0.001), Parkinson's disease (p < 0.001), and obesity (p < 0.01).

TREM2 Expression and Amyloid-Beta Phagocytosis in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of dementia; its key pathological findings include the deposition of extracellular-neurotoxic-plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Ab). AD-pathogenesis involves mechanisms that operate outside the brain, and new researches indicate that peripheral inflammation is an early event in the disease. Herein, we focus on a receptor known as triggering-receptor-expressed-on-myeloid-cells2 (TREM2), which promotes the optimal immune cells function required to attenuate AD-progression and is, therefore, a potential target as peripheral diagnostic and prognostic-biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease. The objective of this exploratory study was to analyze: (1) soluble-TREM2 (sTREM2) plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentration, (2) TREM2-mRNA, (3) the percentage of TREM2-expressing monocytes, and (4) the concentration of miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p suspected to influence TREM2 transcription.

Fluorescent Sensing Platforms for Detecting and Imaging the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease with clinical symptoms of memory loss and cognitive impairment. Currently, no effective drug or therapeutic method is available for curing this disease. The major strategy used is to identify and block AD at its initial stage. Thus, early diagnosis is very important for intervention of the disease and assessment of drug efficacy. The gold standards of clinical diagnosis include the measurement of AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography imaging of the brain for amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits. However, these methods are difficult to apply to the general screening of a large aging population because of their high cost, radioactivity and inaccessibility. Comparatively, blood sample detection is less invasive and more accessible for the diagnosis of AD. Hence, a variety of assays based on fluorescence analysis, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, electrochemistry, etc., were developed for the detection of AD biomarkers in blood. These methods play significant roles in recognizing asymptomatic AD and predicting the course of the disease. In a clinical setting, the combination of blood biomarker detection with brain imaging may enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis. Fluorescence-sensing techniques can be used not only to detect the levels of biomarkers in blood but also to image biomarkers in the brain in real time due to their low toxicity, high sensitivity and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize the newly developed fluorescent sensing platforms and their application in detecting and imaging biomarkers of AD, such as Aβ and tau in the last five years, and discuss their prospects for clinical applications.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; diagnosis,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Biomarkers; tau Proteins,"Liu, X; Liu, Y; Liu, Q"

Alzheimer's Disease-Related Phospho-Tau181 Signals Are Localized to Demyelinated Axons of Parvalbumin-Positive GABAergic Interneurons in an App Knock-In Mouse Model of Amyloid-β Pathology.,"The tau protein phosphorylated at Thr181 (p-tau181) in cerebrospinal fluid and blood is a sensitive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased p-tau181 levels correlate well with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and precede neurofibrillary tangle formation in the early stage of AD; however, the relationship between p-tau181 and Aβ-mediated pathology is less well understood.

Genetic architecture of plasma Alzheimer disease biomarkers.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarker levels have identified novel genes implicated in disease risk, onset and progression. However, lumbar punctures have limited availability and may be perceived as invasive. Blood collection is readily available and well accepted, but it is not clear whether plasma biomarkers will be informative for genetic studies. Here we perform genetic analyses on concentrations of plasma amyloid-β peptides Aβ40 (n = 1,467) and Aβ42 (n = 1,484), Aβ42/40 (n = 1467) total tau (n = 504), tau phosphorylated (p-tau181; n = 1079) and neurofilament light (NfL; n = 2,058). GWAS and gene-based analysis was used to identify single variant and genes associated with plasma levels. Finally, polygenic risk score and summary statistics were used to investigate overlapping genetic architecture between plasma biomarkers, CSF biomarkers and AD risk. We found a total of six genome-wide significant signals. APOE was associated with plasma Aβ42, Aβ42/40, tau, p-tau181 and NfL. We proposed 10 candidate functional genes on the basis of 12 single nucleotide polymorphism-biomarker pairs and brain differential gene expression analysis. We found a significant genetic overlap between CSF and plasma biomarkers. We also demonstrate that it is possible to improve the specificity and sensitivity of these biomarkers, when genetic variants regulating protein levels are included in the model. This current study using plasma biomarker levels as quantitative traits can be critical to identification of novel genes that impact AD and more accurate interpretation of plasma biomarker levels.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Bradley, J; Gorijala, P; Schindler, SE; Sung, YJ; Ances, B; Fernandez, MV; Cruchaga, C"

Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice and trials.,"Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials.

Construction of a microcavity-based microfluidic chip with simultaneous SERS quantification of dual biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Since there is no effective Alzheimer's disease (AD)-modifying therapy available currently, early analysis of AD core biomarkers has become one of great significance and common concern in clinical diagnosis. Herein, we designed an Au-plasmonic shell attached polystyrene (PS) microsphere in a microfluidic chip for simultaneous detection of Aβ1-42 and p-Tau181 protein. The corresponding Raman reporters were identified in femto gram level by ultrasensitive surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Both of Raman experimental data and finite-difference time-domain modeling demonstrates the synergetic coupling between PS microcavity with the optical confinement property and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs, so leading to highly amplified electromagnetic fields at the 'hot spot'. Moreover, the microfluidic system is designed with multiplex testing and control channels in which the AD-related dual proteins were detected quantitatively with a lower limit of 100 fg mL",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR); Microfluidic chip; Polystyrene microcavity; Simultaneous detection; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gold; Microfluidics; Metal Nanoparticles; Biomarkers; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Early Diagnosis","Sun, J; Shi, Z; Wang, L; Zhang, X; Luo, C; Hua, J; Feng, M; Chen, Z; Wang, M; Xu, C"

Oligomers and Neurodegeneration: New Evidence.,"In the last few months new results in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have converged, attracting attention to oligomer species of misfolded proteins, β-amyloid (Aβ and α-synuclein (α-Syn), in the pathogenesis. The high affinity for Aβ protofibrils and oligomers of lecanemab, an antibody recently approved as a disease-modifying drug in AD, and the identification of Aβ-oligomers in blood samples as early biomarkers in subjects with cognitive decline, indicate the oligomers as a therapeutic target and diagnostic tool in AD. α-Syn oligomers were identified by new histopathological techniques in the hippocampus and visual cortex of PD subjects with a distribution distinct from the Lewy body pathologies but associated with cognitive impairment; these species purified from PD brain were highly neurotoxic. In a PD experimental model, we confirmed the presence of α-Syn oligomers associated with cognitive decline and sensitive to drug treatment.",2023,,,"Forloni, G"
Mass spectrometric simultaneous quantification of tau species in plasma shows differential associations with amyloid and tau pathologies.,"Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, at differing sites, demonstrate high accuracy to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, knowledge on the optimal marker for disease identification across the AD continuum and the link to pathology is limited. This is partly due to heterogeneity in analytical methods. In this study, we employed an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry method to simultaneously quantify six phosphorylated (p-tau181, p-tau199, p-tau202, p-tau205, p-tau217 and p-tau231) and two non-phosphorylated plasma tau peptides in a total of 214 participants from the Paris Lariboisière and Translational Biomarkers of Aging and Dementia cohorts. Our results indicate that p-tau217, p-tau231 and p-tau205 are the plasma tau forms that best reflect AD-related brain changes, although with distinct emergences along the disease course and correlations with AD features-amyloid and tau.

The probe Re-BChE was synthesized in a single step and demonstrated dual mode response toward butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a promising biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to the specific hydrolysis reaction, the probe Re-BChE demonstrated a turn-on current response for BChE at -0.28 V, followed by a turn-off current response at -0.18 V, while the fluorescence spectrum demonstrated a turn-on response with an emission wavelength of 600 nm.

Tryptophan Metabolism in Central Nervous System Diseases: Pathophysiology and Potential Therapeutic Strategies.,"The metabolism of L-tryptophan (TRP) regulates homeostasis, immunity, and neuronal function. Altered TRP metabolism has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases of the central nervous system. TRP is metabolized through two main pathways, the kynurenine pathway and the methoxyindole pathway. First, TRP is metabolized to kynurenine, then kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and finally 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid along the kynurenine pathway. Second, TRP is metabolized to serotonin and melatonin along the methoxyindole pathway. In this review, we summarize the biological properties of key metabolites and their pathogenic functions in 12 disorders of the central nervous system: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Furthermore, we summarize preclinical and clinical studies, mainly since 2015, that investigated the metabolic pathway of TRP, focusing on changes in biomarkers of these neurologic disorders, their pathogenic implications, and potential therapeutic strategies targeting this metabolic pathway.

"Glymphatic clearance estimated using diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces is reduced after traumatic brain injury and correlates with plasma neurofilament light, a biomarker of injury severity.","The glymphatic system is a perivascular fluid clearance system, most active during sleep, considered important for clearing the brain of waste products and toxins. Glymphatic failure is hypothesized to underlie brain protein deposition in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease.

Pathophysiological Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Hypertension: A Clinical Concern for Elderly Population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death in the adult population has a complex pathophysiological link with hypertension (HTN). A growing volume of published literature on a parallel elevation of blood pressure (BP), amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles formation in post-middle of human brain cells has developed new, widely accepting foundations on this association. In particular, HTN in elderly life mediates cerebral blood flow dysfunction, neuronal dysfunction, and significant decline in cognitive impairment, primarily in the late-life populace, governing the onset of AD. Thus, HTN is an established risk factor for AD. Considering the impact of AD, 1.89 million deaths annually, and the failure of palliative therapies to cure AD, the scientific research community is looking to adopt integrated approaches to target early modified risk factors like HTN to reduce AD burden. The current review highlights the significance and impact of HTN-based prevention in lowering the AD burden in the elderly by providing a comprehensive overview of the physiological relationship between AD and HTN with an in-detail explanation of the role and applications of pathological biomarkers in this clinical association. The review will gain worth in presenting new insights and providing inclusive discussion on the correlation between HTN and cognitive impairment.

Predictive blood biomarkers and brain changes associated with age-related cognitive decline.,"Growing evidence supports the use of plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, amyloid-β, neurofilament light and glial fibrillary acidic protein as promising biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. While these blood biomarkers are promising for distinguishing people with Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls, their predictive validity for age-related cognitive decline without dementia remains unclear. Further, while tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 is a promising biomarker, the distribution of this phospho-epitope of tau in the brain is unknown. Here, we tested whether plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, amyloid-β, neurofilament light and fibrillary acidic protein predict cognitive decline between ages 72 and 82 in 195 participants in the Lothian birth cohorts 1936 study of cognitive ageing. We further examined post-mortem brain samples from temporal cortex to determine the distribution of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 in the brain. Several forms of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 have been shown to contribute to synapse degeneration in Alzheimer's disease, which correlates closely with cognitive decline in this form of dementia, but to date, there have not been investigations of whether tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 is found in synapses in Alzheimer's disease or healthy ageing brain. It was also previously unclear whether tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 accumulated in dystrophic neurites around plaques, which could contribute to tau leakage to the periphery due to impaired membrane integrity in dystrophies.

The potential of the gut microbiome for identifying Alzheimer's disease diagnostic biomarkers and future therapies.,"Being isolated from the peripheral system by the blood-brain barrier, the brain has long been considered a completely impervious tissue. However, recent findings show that the gut microbiome (GM) influences gastrointestinal and brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite several hypotheses, such as neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and oxidative stress, being proposed to explain the origin and progression of AD, the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Epigenetic, molecular, and pathological studies suggest that GM influences AD development and have endeavored to find predictive, sensitive, non-invasive, and accurate biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and monitoring of progression. Given the growing interest in the involvement of GM in AD, current research endeavors to identify prospective gut biomarkers for both preclinical and clinical diagnoses, as well as targeted therapy techniques. Here, we discuss the most recent findings on gut changes in AD, microbiome-based biomarkers, prospective clinical diagnostic uses, and targeted therapy approaches.

Revolutionizing the Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease through Non-Invasive Biomarkers: The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now classified as a silent pandemic due to concerning current statistics and future predictions. Despite this, no effective treatment or accurate diagnosis currently exists. The negative impacts of invasive techniques and the failure of clinical trials have prompted a shift in research towards non-invasive treatments. In light of this, there is a growing need for early detection of AD through non-invasive approaches. The abundance of data generated by non-invasive techniques such as blood component monitoring, imaging, wearable sensors, and bio-sensors not only offers a platform for more accurate and reliable bio-marker developments but also significantly reduces patient pain, psychological impact, risk of complications, and cost. Nevertheless, there are challenges concerning the computational analysis of the large quantities of data generated, which can provide crucial information for the early diagnosis of AD. Hence, the integration of artificial intelligence and deep learning is critical to addressing these challenges. This work attempts to examine some of the facts and the current situation of these approaches to AD diagnosis by leveraging the potential of these tools and utilizing the vast amount of non-invasive data in order to revolutionize the early detection of AD according to the principles of a new non-invasive medicine era.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; early prediction; explainable AI; non-invasive biomarkers,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Alzheimer Disease; Deep Learning; Biomarkers; Early Diagnosis,"Vrahatis, AG; Skolariki, K; Krokidis, MG; Lazaros, K; Exarchos, TP; Vlamos, P"
Mechano-Chemistry across Phase Transitions in Heated Albumin Protein Solutions.,"The presence of certain proteins in biofluids such as synovial fluid, blood plasma, and saliva gives these fluids non-Newtonian viscoelastic properties. The amount of these protein macromolecules in biofluids is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of various health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disorders, and joint quality. However, existing technologies for measuring the behavior of macromolecules in biofluids have limitations, such as long turnaround times, complex protocols, and insufficient sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose non-contact, optical Brillouin and Raman spectroscopy to assess the viscoelasticity and chemistry of non-Newtonian solutions, respectively, at different temperatures in several minutes. In this work, bovine and human serum albumin solution-based biopolymers were studied to obtain both their collective dynamics and molecular chemical evolution across heat-driven phase transitions at various protein concentrations. The observed phase transitions at elevated temperatures could be fully delayed in heated biopolymers by appropriately raising the level of protein concentration. The non-contact optical monitoring of viscoelastic and chemical property evolution could represent novel potential mechano-chemical biomarkers for disease diagnosis and subsequent treatment applications, including hyperthermia.",2023,Brillouin scattering; Raman scattering; albumin; denaturation; gelation; heating; mechano-chemical; phase transitions; polymer; protein; viscoelastic,,"Kharmyssov, C; Sekerbayev, K; Nurekeyev, Z; Gaipov, A; Utegulov, ZN"
Blood-Based Proteomic Profiling Identifies Potential Biomarker Candidates and Pathogenic Pathways in Dementia.,"Dementia is a progressive and debilitating neurological disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Identifying the minimally invasive biomarkers associated with dementia that could provide insights into the disease pathogenesis, improve early diagnosis, and facilitate the development of effective treatments is pressing. Proteomic studies have emerged as a promising approach for identifying the protein biomarkers associated with dementia. This pilot study aimed to investigate the plasma proteome profile and identify a panel of various protein biomarkers for dementia. We used a high-throughput proximity extension immunoassay to quantify 1090 proteins in 122 participants (22 with dementia, 64 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 36 controls with normal cognitive function). Limma-based differential expression analysis reported the dysregulation of 61 proteins in the plasma of those with dementia compared with controls, and machine learning algorithms identified 17 stable diagnostic biomarkers that differentiated individuals with AUC = 0.98 ± 0.02. There was also the dysregulation of 153 plasma proteins in individuals with dementia compared with those with MCI, and machine learning algorithms identified 8 biomarkers that classified dementia from MCI with an AUC of 0.87 ± 0.07.

Ultrastructural and Molecular Investigation on Peripheral Leukocytes in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"Thriving literature underlines white blood cell involvement in the inflammatory processes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Among leukocytes, lymphocytes have been considered sentinels of neuroinflammation for years, but recent findings highlighted the pivotal role of neutrophils. Since neutrophils that infiltrate the brain through the brain vascular vessels may affect the immune function of microglia in the brain, a close investigation of the interaction between these cells is important in understanding neuroinflammatory phenomena and the immunological aftermaths that follow. This study aimed to observe how peripheral leukocyte features change at different stages of AD to identify potential molecular markers when the first features of pathological neurodegeneration arise. For this purpose, the examined patients were divided into Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and severely impaired patients (DAT) based on their Cognitive Dementia Rating (CDR). The evaluation of the neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio and the morphology and function of leukocytes showed a close relationship between the ultrastructural and the molecular features in AD progression and suggested putative markers for the early stages of the disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood biomarkers; endoplasmic reticulum; neurodegeneration; neutrophils; ultrastructure,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Microglia; Leukocytes; Biomarkers; Disease Progression,"Giannelli, R; Canale, P; Del Carratore, R; Falleni, A; Bernardeschi, M; Forini, F; Biagi, E; Curzio, O; Bongioanni, P"
GFAP as a Potential Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Blood biomarkers have been considered tools for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and tau are primarily blood biomarkers, recent studies have identified other reliable candidates that can serve as measurable indicators of pathological conditions. One such candidate is the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocytic cytoskeletal protein that can be detected in blood samples. Increasing evidence suggests that blood GFAP levels can be used to detect early-stage AD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate GFAP in peripheral blood as a biomarker for AD and provide an overview of the evidence regarding its utility. Our analysis revealed that the GFAP level in the blood was higher in the Aβ-positive group than in the negative groups, and in individuals with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to the healthy controls. Therefore, we believe that the clinical use of blood GFAP measurements has the potential to accelerate the diagnosis and improve the prognosis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; GFAP; blood biomarker; cognitive impairment; glial fibrillary acidic protein,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,"Kim, KY; Shin, KY; Chang, KA"

Association of insulin resistance with delirium and CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in elderly patients with hip fracture.,"Delirium is associated with dementia, which shares symptoms of cognitive dysfunctions. Notably, pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) appear involved in both conditions.

Thus, insulin resistance may provide pathophysiological clues to the occurrence of delirium.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF biomarkers; Delirium; Dementia; Hip fracture; Insulin resistance,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Insulin Resistance; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Hip Fractures; Insulin; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Wang, J; Shuang, P; Li, Z; Zhao, L; Wang, X; Liu, P"
"Assessing adipokines as potential biomarkers of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Midlife obesity and late-life weight loss confer a greater risk for developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon are currently unknown. The answer could lie on the involvement of gastrointestinal factors, such as adipokines (e.g., leptin, adiponectin, and resistin) and ghrelin. In this context, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 cross-sectional and 13 longitudinal studies targeting the associations between leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin and the prevalence of general dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We also examined the relationship between the four gastrointestinal factors and neurocognitive outcomes and AD-related cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Patients with AD had lower blood leptin and higher resistin levels than cognitively normal participants. Lower leptin and higher resistin were associated with higher degree of cognitive impairment. Additionally, lower late-life leptin levels might be associated with higher prospective risk of dementia and AD, although more studies are needed to corroborate this. Results in ghrelin and adiponectin were not conclusive, with age, sex distribution, obesity, and severity of dementia seemingly acting as moderators across several analyses.

"Racialized experience, biomarkers of lead exposure, and later-life cognition: a mediation analysis.","We evaluated the role of the neurotoxicant lead (Pb) in mediating racial disparities in later-life cognition in 1,085 non-Hispanic Black and 2,839 non-Hispanic white participants in NHANES (1999-2002, 2011-2014) 60+ years of age. We operationalized Black race as a marker for the experience of racialization and exposure to systemic racism. We estimated patella bone Pb via predictive models using blood Pb and demographics. Concurrent cognition (processing speed, sustained attention, working memory) was measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and a global measure combining four cognitive tests. To obtain the portion mediated, we used regression coefficients (race on Pb * Pb on cognitive score)/(race on cognitive score), adjusting for age, NHANES cycle, and sample weights. Other confounder adjustment (education, poverty income ratio, smoking) was limited to the mediator-outcome (i.e., Pb-cognition) pathway because these factors do not lie upstream of race and so cannot confound associations with race. Pb was estimated to mediate 0.6% of the association between race and global cognition, and 4% of the DSST. Our results suggest that later-life cognitive health disparities may be impacted by avoidable lead exposure driven by environmental injustice, noting that a large proportion of the pathway of systemic racism harming cognition remains.",2023,aging; cognition; environmental exposure; environmental injustice; epidemiologic methods; lead exposure; mediation analysis; racial groups,,"Jenson, TE; Bakulski, KM; Wesp, L; Dookeran, K; Driscoll, I; Kalkbrenner, AE"
Senolytic therapy to modulate the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (SToMP-AD) - Outcomes from the first clinical trial of senolytic therapy for Alzheimer's disease.,"Cellular senescence has been identified as a pathological mechanism linked to tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clearance of senescent cells using the senolytic compounds dasatinib (D) and quercetin (Q) reduced neuropathological burden and improved clinically relevant outcomes in the mice. Herein, we conducted a vanguard open-label clinical trial of senolytic therapy for AD with the primary aim of evaluating central nervous system (CNS) penetrance, as well as exploratory data collection relevant to safety, feasibility, and efficacy. Participants with early-stage symptomatic AD were enrolled in an open-label, 12-week pilot study of intermittent orally-delivered D+Q. CNS penetrance was assessed by evaluating drug levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Safety was continuously monitored with adverse event reporting, vitals, and laboratory work. Cognition, neuroimaging, and plasma and CSF biomarkers were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. Five participants (mean age: 76±5 years; 40% female) completed the trial. The treatment increased D and Q levels in the blood of all participants ranging from 12.7 to 73.5 ng/ml for D and 3.29-26.30 ng/ml for Q. D levels were detected in the CSF of four participants ranging from 0.281 to 0.536 ng/ml (t(4)=3.123, p=0.035); Q was not detected. Treatment was well-tolerated with no early discontinuation and six mild to moderate adverse events occurring across the study. Cognitive and neuroimaging endpoints did not significantly differ from baseline to post-treatment. CNS levels of IL-6 and GFAP increased from baseline to post-treatment (t(4)=3.913, p=008 and t(4)=3.354, p=0.028, respectively) concomitant with decreased levels of several cytokines and chemokines associated with senescence, and a trend toward higher levels of Aβ42 (t(4)=-2.338, p=0.079). Collectively the data indicate the CNS penetrance of D and provide preliminary support for the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of the intervention and suggest that astrocytes and Aβ may be particularly responsive to the treatment. While early results are promising, fully powered, placebo-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the potential of AD modification with the novel approach of targeting cellular senescence.",2023,,,"Gonzales, MM; Garbarino, VR; Kautz, T; Palavicini, JP; Lopez-Cruzan, M; Dehkordi, SK; Mathews, J; Zare, H; Xu, P; Zhang, B; Franklin, C; Habes, M; Craft, S; Petersen, RC; Tchkonia, T; Kirkland, J; Salardini, A; Seshadri, S; Musi, N; Orr, ME"
Eigenvector centrality dynamics are related to Alzheimer's disease pathological changes in non-demented individuals.,"Amyloid-β accumulation starts in highly connected brain regions and is associated with functional connectivity alterations in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This regional vulnerability is related to the high neuronal activity and strong fluctuations typical of these regions. Recently, dynamic functional connectivity was introduced to investigate changes in functional network organization over time. High dynamic functional connectivity variations indicate increased regional flexibility to participate in multiple subnetworks, promoting functional integration. Currently, only a limited number of studies have explored the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity in the pre-dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. We study the associations between abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and both static and dynamic properties of functional hubs, using eigenvector centrality, and their relationship with cognitive performance, in 701 non-demented participants from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia cohort. Voxel-wise eigenvector centrality was computed for the whole functional magnetic resonance imaging time series (static), and within a sliding window (dynamic). Differences in static eigenvector centrality between amyloid positive (A+) and negative (A-) participants and amyloid-tau groups were found in a general linear model. Dynamic eigenvector centrality standard deviation and range were compared between groups within clusters of significant static eigenvector centrality differences, and within 10 canonical resting-state networks. The effect of the interaction between amyloid status and cognitive performance on dynamic eigenvector centrality variability was also evaluated with linear models. Models were corrected for age, sex, and education level. Lower static centrality was found in A+ participants in posterior brain areas including a parietal and an occipital cluster; higher static centrality was found in a medio-frontal cluster. Lower eigenvector centrality variability (standard deviation) occurred in A+ participants in the frontal cluster. The default mode network and the dorsal visual networks of A+ participants had lower dynamic eigenvector centrality variability. Centrality variability in the default mode network and dorsal visual networks were associated with cognitive performance in the A- and A+ groups, with lower variability being observed in A+ participants with good cognitive scores. Our results support the role and timing of eigenvector centrality alterations in very early stages of Alzheimer's disease and show that centrality variability over time adds relevant information on the dynamic patterns that cause static eigenvector centrality alterations. We propose that dynamic eigenvector centrality is an early biomarker of the interplay between early Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline.",2023,amyloid; eigenvector centrality; functional connectivity; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease,,"Lorenzini, L; Ingala, S; Collij, LE; Wottschel, V; Haller, S; Blennow, K; Frisoni, G; Chételat, G; Payoux, P; Lage-Martinez, P; Ewers, M; Waldman, A; Wardlaw, J; Ritchie, C; Gispert, JD; Mutsaerts, HJMM; Visser, PJ; Scheltens, P; Tijms, B; Barkhof, F; Wink, AM"

Elevated CSF angiopoietin-2 correlates with blood-brain barrier leakiness and markers of neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Breakdown of the neurovascular unit in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to leakiness of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), contributing to cognitive decline and disease pathology. Vascular stability depends on angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) signalling, antagonised by angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) upon endothelial injury. We have examined the relationship between CSF ANGPT2 and CSF markers of BBB leakiness and disease pathology, across three independent cohorts: (i) 31 AD patients and 33 healthy controls grouped according to their biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and Aβ42 < 550 pg/mL); (ii) 121 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research study (84 participants cognitively unimpaired (CU) enriched for a parental history of AD, 19 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 21 with AD); (iii) a neurologically normal cohort aged 23-78 years with paired CSF and serum samples. CSF ANGPT2 level was measured by sandwich ELISA. In cohort (i), CSF ANGPT2 was elevated in AD, correlating with CSF t-tau and p-tau181 but not Aβ42. ANGPT2 also correlated positively with CSF sPDGFRβ and fibrinogen - markers of pericyte injury and BBB leakiness. In cohort (ii), CSF ANGPT2 was highest in MCI. CSF ANGT2 correlated with CSF albumin in the CU and MCI cohorts but not in AD. ANGPT2 also correlated with t-tau and p-tau and with markers of neuronal injury (neurogranin and α-synuclein) and neuroinflammation (GFAP and YKL-40). In cohort (iii), CSF ANGPT2 correlated strongly with the CSF:serum albumin ratio. Increased CSF ANGPT2 and the CSF:serum albumin ratio showed non-significant associations with elevated serum ANGPT2 in this small cohort. Together, these data indicate that CSF ANGPT2 is associated with BBB leakiness in early AD and is closely related to tau pathology and neuronal injury. The utility of serum ANGPT2 as a biomarker of BBB damage in AD requires further study.",2023,,,"Miners, J; van Hulle, C; Ince, S; Jonaitis, E; Okonkwo, OC; Bendlin, B; Johnson, S; Carlsson, C; Asthana, S; Love, S; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H"
AANet: Attentive All-level Fusion Deep Neural Network Approach for Multi-modality Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Multi-modality deep learning models have recently been used for disease diagnosis; however, effectively integrating diverse, complex, and heterogeneous data remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel system, attentive All-level Fusion(AANet), to fuse multi-level and multi-modality patient data, including 3D brain images, patient demographics, genetics, and blood biomarkers into a deep-learning framework for disease diagnosis, and tested it for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. We first constructed a deep learning feature pyramid network for whole-brain brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature extraction. We then leveraged the self-attention-based all-level fusion method by automatically adjusting weights of all-level MRI image features, patient demographics, blood biomarkers, and genetic data. We trained and tested AANet on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for the task of classifying mild cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease, a challenging task in early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. AANet achieved an accuracy of 90.5%, outperformed several state-of-the-art methods. In summary, AANet provides an advanced methodological framework for multi-modality-based disease diagnosis.",2022,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction","Wang, Q; Xu, R"
Sex differences in the progression of glucose metabolism dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid plaques and impaired brain metabolism. Because women have a higher prevalence of AD than men, sex differences are of great interest. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal data, we showed sex-dependent metabolic dysregulations in the brains of AD patients. Cohort 1 (South Korean, n = 181) underwent Pittsburgh compound B-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood biomarker (plasma tau and beta-amyloid 42 and 40) measurements at baseline and two-year follow-ups. Transcriptome analysis of data from Cohorts 2 and 3 (European, n = 78; Singaporean, n = 18) revealed sex differences in AD-related alterations in brain metabolism. In women (but not in men), all imaging indicators displayed consistent correlation curves with AD progression. At the two-year follow-up, clear brain metabolic impairment was revealed only in women, and the plasma beta-amyloid 42/40 ratio was a possible biomarker for brain metabolism in women. Furthermore, our transcriptome analysis revealed sex differences in transcriptomes and metabolism in the brains of AD patients as well as a molecular network of 25 female-specific glucose metabolic genes (FGGs). We discovered four key-attractor FGG genes (ALDOA, ENO2, PRKACB, and PPP2R5D) that were associated with amyloid/tau-related genes (APP, MAPT, BACE1, and BACE2). Furthermore, these genes successfully distinguished amyloid positivity in women.

CSF tau phosphorylation occupancies at T217 and T205 represent improved biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)42/Aβ40 and the concentration of tau phosphorylated at site 181 (p-tau181) are well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study used mass spectrometry to measure concentrations of nine phosphorylated and five nonphosphorylated tau species and phosphorylation occupancies (percentage phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated) at ten sites. In the present study we show that, in 750 individuals with a median age of 71.2 years, CSF pT217/T217 predicted the presence of brain amyloid by positron emission tomography (PET) slightly better than Aβ42/Aβ40 (P = 0.02). Furthermore, for individuals with positive brain amyloid by PET (n = 263), CSF pT217/T217 was more strongly correlated with the amount of amyloid (Spearman's ρ = 0.69) than Aβ42/Aβ40 (ρ = -0.42, P < 0.0001). In two independent cohorts of participants with symptoms of AD dementia (n = 55 and n = 90), CSF pT217/T217 and pT205/T205 were better correlated with tau PET measures than CSF p-tau181 concentration.

Exploring the role of cerebrospinal fluid as analyte in neurologic disorders.,"The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear ultrafiltrate of blood that envelopes and protects the central nervous system while regulating neuronal function through the maintenance of interstitial fluid homeostasis in the brain. Due to its anatomic location and physiological functions, the CSF can provide a reliable source of biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of different neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and primary and secondary brain malignancies. The incorporation of CSF biomarkers into the drug discovery and development can improve the efficiency of drug development and increase the chances of success.

"Methodological flaws in""diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis"".","We read with interest the review by Chen et al. They intended to examine the diagnostic accuracy of blood-based biomarkers for detecting Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment. We believe that there were substantial methodological flaws in their meta-analysis. These methodological flaws included no comprehensive literature search details, neglect of the negative result research, no prespecified cut-off values, erroneous data input in their meta-analysis, and the issue of prevalence determined by the included studies. These factors potentially contributed to overestimation of the discriminative accuracy of blood-based biomarkers. Subsequently, the conclusion that blood-based biomarkers are effective tools for detecting Alzheimer's disease is debatable without correction of these methodological flaws and providing robust and trustworthy estimates.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Amyloid beta peptides; Biomarkers; Plasma; Tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Prevalence; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Hsu, YP; Hsu, CW; Chen, LF; Liu, YK"

Higher CSF/serum free-T4 ratio is associated with improvement of quality of life during treatment with L-thyroxine.,"Up to 20% of individuals with primary hypothyroidism treated with L-thyroxine still suffer from severe symptoms. These are supposedly brain derived and involve both cognitive and emotional domains. Previously, no consistent relationship has been found between thyroid hormones (TH) or TSH levels in blood and quality of life (QoL). Recently, we reported an association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum free-thyroxine (f-T4) ratio and QoL, in juvenile hypothyroid patients. Here, we investigated if CSF/serum f-T4 ratio and QoL estimates correlate also during L-thyroxine treatment. Moreover, the CSF biomarker neurogranin (Ng) was used as a biomarker for synaptic function and integrity in clinical research. Ng is partially controlled by TH and therefore we investigated the relationship between QoL parameters and Ng levels. Patients diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism were investigated using vital parameters, serum and CSF analyses of TH, TSH, Ng and QoL questionnaires. Similar procedures were performed after 6 months of treatment. The most marked associations with QoL were found for CSF/serum f-T4 ratio, which was strongly related to several QoL parameters such as the mental subscore of SF-36 (r = 0.83, p < .0005). Ng, which did not differ from that in our healthy controls, was lower in some patients during treatment and higher in others. However, the change in Ng during treatment was significantly correlated with QoL parameters including the mental subscore of SF-36 (r = -0.86, p < .0001). In addition, the CSF/serum f-T4 ratio correlated with the change in Ng (r = -0.75, p = .001). Our results suggest that the ratio between CSF and serum f-T4 is an important biomarker for QoL during treatment of patients with primary hypothyroidism, so far in research, but in the future maybe also in clinical settings. Moreover, this ratio also correlates with the changes in Ng levels during L-thyroxine treatment, further supporting the impact of the TH balance between serum and CSF on QoL.",2023,cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; cognition; neurogranin; primary hypothyroidism; quality of life,Humans; Thyroxine; Quality of Life; Triiodothyronine; Thyrotropin; Thyroid Hormones; Hypothyroidism; Biomarkers,"Funkquist, A; Wandt, B; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Svensson, J; Bjellerup, P; Freund-Levi, Y; Sjöberg, S"

Plasma ATN(I) classification and precision pharmacology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Evaluating potential therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) depends on use of biomarkers for appropriate subject selection and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers that predict onset of clinical symptoms are particularly important for AD because they enable intervention before irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. The amyloid-β-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) classification system is currently used as a biological staging model for AD and is based on three classes of biomarkers evaluating amyloid-β (Aβ), tau pathology and neurodegeneration or neuronal injury. Promising blood-based biomarkers for each of these categories have been identified (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, phosphorylated tau, neurofilament light chain), and this matrix is now being expanded toward an ATN(I) system, where ""I"" represents a neuroinflammatory biomarker.

Respective influence of beta-amyloid and APOE ε4 genotype on medial temporal lobe subregions in cognitively unimpaired older adults.,"Medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions are differentially affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a specific involvement of the entorhinal cortex (ERC), perirhinal cortex and hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA)1. While amyloid (Aβ) and APOEε4 are respectively the first molecular change and the main genetic risk factor in AD, their links with MTL atrophy remain relatively unclear. Our aim was to uncover these effects using baseline data from 130 participants included in the Age-Well study, for whom ultra-high-resolution structural MRI, amyloid-PET and APOEε4 genotype were available. No volume differences were observed between Aβ + (n = 24) and Aβ- (n = 103), nor between APOE4+ (n = 35) and APOE4- (n = 95) participants. However, our analyses showed that both Aβ and APOEε4 status interacted with age on CA1, which is known to be specifically atrophied in early AD. In addition, APOEε4 status moderated the effects of age on other subregions (subiculum, ERC), suggesting a more important contribution of APOEε4 than Aβ to MTL atrophy in cognitively unimpaired population.

CD31 as a probable responding and gate-keeping protein of the blood-brain barrier and the risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Several studies have shown that an abnormal vascular-immunity link could increase Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk; however, the mechanism is unclear. CD31, also named platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), is a surface membrane protein of both endothelial and immune cells and plays important roles in the interaction between the vascular and immune systems. In this review, we focus on research regarding CD31 biological actions in the pathological process that may contribute to AD based on the following rationales. First, endothelial, leukocyte and soluble forms of CD31 play multi-roles in regulating transendothelial migration, increasing blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and resulting in neuroinflammation. Second, CD31 expressed by endothelial and immune cells dynamically modulates numbers of signaling pathways, including Src family kinases, selected G proteins, and β-catenin which in turn affect cell-matrix and cell-cell attachment, activation, permeability, survival, and ultimately neuronal cell injury. In endothelia and immune cells, these diverse CD31-mediated pathways act as a critical regulator in the immunity-endothelia-brain axis, thereby mediating AD pathogenesis in ApoE4 carriers, which is the major genetic risk factor for AD. This evidence suggests a novel mechanism and potential drug target for CD31 in the background of genetic vulnerabilities and peripheral inflammation for AD development and progression.",2023,Alzheimer's disease (AD); CD31; blood–brain barrier (BBB); neuroinflammation; trans-endothelia,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Signal Transduction; Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration,"Zhang, Z; Gan, Q; Han, J; Tao, Q; Qiu, WQ; Madri, JA"

"Plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 in discriminating PART, AD and other key neuropathologies in older adults.","We examined whether plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 are specific biomarkers of pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, we investigated the utility of plasma p-tau for differentiating AD from primary age-related tauopathy (PART), as well as AD with mixed pathologies. Data came from 269 older adults who participated in the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Blood samples were collected during annual clinical evaluations. Participants died and underwent brain autopsy. P-tau181 and p-tau217 were quantified in the plasma samples proximate to death (average interval before death: 1.4 years) using Lilly-developed MSD immunoassays. Uniform neuropathologic evaluations assessed AD, PART, and other common degenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. Plasma p-tau217 was more strongly correlated with brain β-amyloid and paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) tangles than p-tau181. Both p-tau markers were associated with greater odds of AD, but p-tau217 had higher accuracy (area under the ROC curve (AUC): 0.83) than p-tau181 (AUC: 0.76). Plasma p-tau markers were almost exclusively associated with AD pathologic indices with the exception of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Compared to p-tau181, p-tau217 showed a higher AUC (0.82 versus 0.74) in differentiating AD from PART. For either p-tau, we did not observe a level difference between individuals with AD alone and those with mixed AD pathologies. In summary, plasma p-tau181and p-tau217 were specifically associated with AD pathological changes. Further, our data provide initial evidence that p-tau217 may be able to differentiate between AD and PART in individuals with comparable burdens of tau tangle pathology.

Sex Differences in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Reviewing the research presented in this article, it is evident that from an epidemiological perspective, it is important to evaluate the extent to which findings of sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) are due to differences in longevity, survival bias, and comorbidities. Medical, genetic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors, in addition to hormonal factors, can differentially affect the risk and progression of AD in women versus men. Further, evaluation of sex differences in AD progression and the trajectory of change in cognitive function, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood-based biomarkers of AD is needed. Finally, identifying sex differences in AD biomarkers and change across the lifespan is critical for the planning of prevention trials to reduce the risk of developing AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s dementia; Biomarkers; Cognitive decline; Risk factors; Sex differences,Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Sex Factors; Sex Characteristics; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; tau Proteins,"Aggarwal, NT; Mielke, MM"
"The Relationship of Omega-3 Fatty Acids with Dementia and Cognitive Decline: Evidence from Prospective Cohort Studies of Supplementation, Dietary Intake, and Blood Markers.","Previous data have linked omega-3 fatty acids with risk of dementia. We aimed to assess the longitudinal relationships of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake as well as blood biomarkers with risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia, or cognitive decline. Longitudinal data were derived from 1135 participants without dementia (mean age = 73 y) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort to evaluate the associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and blood biomarkers with incident AD during the 6-y follow-up. A meta-analysis of published cohort studies was further conducted to test the longitudinal relationships of dietary intake of omega-3 and its peripheral markers with all-cause dementia or cognitive decline. Causal dose-response analyses were conducted using the robust error meta-regression model. In the ADNI cohort, long-term users of omega-3 fatty acid supplements exhibited a 64% reduced risk of AD (hazard ratio: 0.36, 95% confidence interval: 0.18, 0.72; P = 0.004). After incorporating 48 longitudinal studies involving 103,651 participants, a moderate-to-high level of evidence suggested that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids could lower risk of all-cause dementia or cognitive decline by ∼20%, especially for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake (relative risk [RR]: 0.82, I",2023,AD; biomarker; cognitive decline; dementia; dietary; omega-3 fatty acid,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Prospective Studies; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Eicosapentaenoic Acid; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dietary Supplements; Cohort Studies; Eating","Wei, BZ; Li, L; Dong, CW; Tan, CC; Xu, W"

Hepatic and cardiac implications of increased toxic amyloid-beta serum level in lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation in rats: new insights into alleviating therapeutic interventions.,"Neuroinflammation is a devastating predisposing factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of clinical findings have reported peripheral disorders among AD patients. Amyloid beta (Aβ) is a toxic physiological aggregate that serves as a triggering factor for hepatic and cardiac disorders related to neurotoxicity. As a drawback of Aβ excessive accumulation in the brain, part of Aβ is believed to readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the peripheral circulation resulting in serious inflammatory and toxic cascades acting as a direct bridge to cardiac and hepatic pathophysiology. The main aim is to find out whether neuroinflammation-related AD may result in cardiac and liver dysfunctions. Potential therapeutic interventions are also suggested to alleviate AD's cardiac and hepatic defects. Male rats were divided into: control group I, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-neuroinflammatory-induced group II, LPS-neuroinflammatory-induced group treated with sodium hydrogen sulphide donor (NaHS) (group III), and LPS-neuroinflammatory-induced group treated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (group IV). Behavior and histopathological studies were conducted in addition to the estimation of different biological biomarkers. It was revealed that the increased toxic Aβ level in blood resulted in cardiac and hepatic malfunctions as a drawback of exaggerated inflammatory cascades. The administration of NaHS and MSCs proved their efficiency in combating neuroinflammatory drawbacks by hindering cardiac and hepatic dysfunctions. The consistent direct association of decreased heart and liver functions with increased Aβ levels highlights the direct involvement of AD in other organ complications. Thereby, these findings will open new avenues for combating neuroinflammatory-related AD and long-term asymptomatic toxicity.",2023,Albumin; Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ; Cardiac dysfunctions; Hepatic dysfunctions; Neuroinflammation,Rats; Male; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Lipopolysaccharides; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Liver,"Anwar, MM; Mabrouk, AA"

Precise profiling of exosomal biomarkers via programmable curved plasmonic nanoarchitecture-based biosensor for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of complex pathogenesis, with overt symptoms following disease progression. Early AD diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of robust biomarkers and limited patient access to diagnostics via neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests. Exosomes present in body fluids are attracting attention as diagnostic biomarkers that directly reflect neuropathological features within the brain. In particular, exosomal miRNAs (exomiRs) signatures are involved in AD pathogenesis, showing a different expression between patients and the healthy controls (HCs). However, low yield and high homologous nature impede the accuracy and reproducibility of exosome blood-based AD diagnostics. Here, we developed a programmable curved plasmonic nanoarchitecture-based biosensor to analyze exomiRs in clinical serum samples for accurate AD diagnosis. To allow the detection of exomiRs in serum at attomolar levels, nanospaces (e.g., nanocrevice and nanocavity) were introduced into the nanostructures to dramatically increase the spectral sensitivity by adjusting the bending angle of the plasmonic nanostructure through sodium chloride concentration control. The developed biosensor classifies individuals into AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and HCs through profiling and quantifying exomiRs. Furthermore, integrating analysis expression patterns of multiple exosomal biomarkers improved serum-based diagnostic performance (average accuracy of 98.22%). Therefore, precise, highly sensitive serum-derived exosomal biomarker detection-based plasmonic biosensor has a robust capacity to predict the molecular pathologic of neurodegenerative disease, progression of cognitive decline, MCI/AD conversion, as well as early diagnosis and treatment.",2023,Alzheimer's disease (AD); Exosome; Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs); Liquid biopsy; Plasmonic biosensors; miRNA,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Reproducibility of Results; Biosensing Techniques; Biomarkers; MicroRNAs; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Progression,"Song, S; Lee, JU; Jeon, MJ; Kim, S; Lee, CN; Sim, SJ"

Alzheimer's and vascular disease classification using regional texture biomarkers in FLAIR MRI.,"Interactions between subcortical vascular disease and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unclear, and clinical overlap between the diseases makes diagnosis challenging. Existing studies have shown regional microstructural changes specific to each disease, and that textures in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI images may characterize abnormalities in tissue microstructure. This work aims to investigate regional FLAIR biomarkers that can differentiate dementia cohorts with and without subcortical vascular disease. FLAIR and diffusion MRI (dMRI) volumes were obtained in 65 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 21 AD, 44 subcortical vascular MCI (scVMCI), 22 Mixed etiology, and 48 healthy elderly patients. FLAIR texture and intensity biomarkers were extracted from the normal appearing brain matter (NABM), WML penumbra, blood supply territory (BST), and white matter tract regions of each patient. All FLAIR biomarkers were correlated to dMRI metrics in each region and global WML load, and biomarker means between groups were compared using ANOVA. Binary classifications were performed using Random Forest classifiers to investigate the predictive nature of the regional biomarkers, and SHAP feature analysis was performed to further investigate optimal regions of interest for differentiating disease groups. The regional FLAIR biomarkers were strongly correlated to MD, while all biomarker regions but white matter tracts were strongly correlated to WML burden. Classification between Mixed disease and healthy, AD, and scVMCI patients yielded accuracies of 97%, 81%, and 72% respectively using WM tract biomarkers. Classification between scVMCI and healthy, MCI, and AD patients yielded accuracies of 89%, 84%, and 79% respectively using penumbra biomarkers. Only the classification between AD and healthy patients had optimal results using NABM biomarkers. This work presents novel regional FLAIR biomarkers that may quantify white matter degeneration related to subcortical vascular disease, and which indicate that investigating degeneration in specific regions may be more important than assessing global WML burden in vascular disease groups.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; FLAIR; Neurodegeneration; Regional biomarkers; Subcortical vascular disease; Texture analysis,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; White Matter; Cognitive Dysfunction; Vascular Diseases; Biomarkers,"Chan, K; Fischer, C; Maralani, PJ; Black, SE; Moody, AR; Khademi, A"

Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers Reduce Tau/Aß42 Ratio: A Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers' Case-Control Study.,"(1) Background: The role of antihypertensives in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) prevention is controversial. This case-control study aims to assess whether antihypertensive medication has a protective role by studying its association with amyloid and tau abnormal levels. Furthermore, it suggests a holistic view of the involved pathways between renin-angiotensin drugs and the tau/amyloidß42 ratio (tau/Aß42 ratio); (2) Methods: The medical records of the participant patients were reviewed, with a focus on prescribed antihypertensive drugs and clinical variables, such as arterial blood pressure. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification was used to classify each drug. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with AD diagnosis (cases) and cognitively healthy patients (control); (3) Results: Age and high systolic blood pressure are associated with a higher risk of developing AD. In addition, combinations of angiotensin II receptor blockers are associated with a 30% lower t-tau/Aß42 ratio than plain angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor consumption; (4) Conclusions: Angiotensin II receptor blockers may play a potential role in neuroprotection and AD prevention. Likewise, several mechanisms, such as the PI3K/Akt/GSK3ß or the ACE1/AngII/AT1R axis, may link cardiovascular pathologies and AD presence, making its modulation a pivotal point in AD prevention.

Biomarkers Assessing Endothelial Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative disorder in the elderly in developed countries. Currently, growing evidence is pointing at endothelial dysfunction as a key player in the cognitive decline course of AD. As a main component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the dysfunction of endothelial cells driven by vascular risk factors associated with AD allows the passage of toxic substances to the cerebral parenchyma, producing chronic hypoperfusion that eventually causes an inflammatory and neurotoxic response. In this process, the levels of several biomarkers are disrupted, such as an increase in adhesion molecules that allow the passage of leukocytes to the cerebral parenchyma, increasing the permeability of the BBB; moreover, other vascular players, including endothelin-1, also mediate artery inflammation. As a consequence of the disruption of the BBB, a progressive neuroinflammatory response is produced that, added to the astrogliosis, eventually triggers neuronal degeneration (possibly responsible for cognitive deterioration). Recently, new molecules have been proposed as early biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction that can constitute new therapeutic targets as well as early diagnostic and prognostic markers for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; EPCs; VEGF; albumin; cell adhesion molecules; endothelial dysfunction; endothelin-1; metalloproteinases; neuroimaging; vascular alteration,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Endothelial Cells; Blood-Brain Barrier; Cognition Disorders; Vascular Diseases; Biomarkers,"Custodia, A; Aramburu-Núñez, M; Rodríguez-Arrizabalaga, M; Pías-Peleteiro, JM; Vázquez-Vázquez, L; Camino-Castiñeiras, J; Aldrey, JM; Castillo, J; Ouro, A; Sobrino, T; Romaus-Sanjurjo, D"
Elevated Soluble TNF-Receptor 1 in the Serum of Predementia Subjects with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.,"Tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNF-R1)-mediated signaling is critical to the regulation of inflammatory responses. TNF-R1 can be proteolytically released into systemic blood circulation in a soluble form (sTNF-R1), where it binds to circulating TNF and functions to attenuate TNF-mediated inflammation. Increases of peripheral sTNF-R1 have been reported in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and vascular dementia (VaD). However, the status of sTNF-R1 in predementia subjects (cognitive impairment, no dementia, CIND) is unknown, and putative associations with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), as well as with longitudinal changes in cognitive functions are unclear. We measured baseline serum sTNF-R1 in a longitudinally assessed cohort of 93 controls and 103 CIND, along with neuropsychological evaluations and neuroimaging assessments.

Ubiquitin Is Not a Blood Biomarker of an Early Cognitive Decline in the Polish Elderly.,"Together with development of new pharmaceutical interventions, as well as the introduction of the concept of initial dementia phase, the demand for early diagnosis has been growing. Research on potential blood biomarkers, amazingly attractive, mainly due to the facility of deriving the material, has provided ambiguous results throughout. The existence of an association between ubiquitin and Alzheimer's disease pathology suggests that it could be a potential neurodegeneration biomarker. The present study aims to identify and assess the relationship between ubiquitin with regard to the adequacy as a biomarker of an initial dementia and cognitive decline in the elderly. Method: The study sample was composed of 230 participants: 109 women and 121 men aged 65 and older. The relationships of plasma ubiquitin levels with cognitive performance, gender, and age were analyzed. The assessments were performed in three groups of cognitive functioning level: cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and mild dementia, of which the subjects were divided with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: No significant disparities in plasma ubiquitin levels for various levels of cognitive functioning were identified. Significantly higher plasma ubiquitin levels in women were found in comparison to men. No significant differences were found in ubiquitin concentrations based on age. Results suggest that ubiquitin does not meet the requirements for qualification as a blood biomarker of an early cognitive decline. In order to thoroughly evaluate the potential of research on ubiquitin in connection to an early neurodegenerative process, further studies are needed.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; blood; dementia; mild cognitive impairment; ubiquitin,,"McFarlane, O; Kozakiewicz, M; Wojciechowska, M; Kędziora-Kornatowska, K"

Predictive Utility of Plasma Amyloid and Tau for Cognitive Decline in Cognitively Normal Adults.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting mostly elderly adults. Recent diagnostic criteria for AD recommend the use of imaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers together with clinical presentation for a more persuasive diagnosis. The invasiveness and expense of such examinations have led to the search for blood-based biomarkers. The plasma levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein and tau peptides have been found to correlate with CSF levels and imaging findings in patients with AD.

"Decreased functional connectivity is associated with increased levels of Cerebral Spinal Fluid soluble-PDGFRβ, a marker of blood brain barrier breakdown, in older adults.","Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is suggested to be cross-sectionally associated with both vascular burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. For instance, studies in pre-clinical AD subjects have shown increases of cerebral spinal fluid soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (CSF sPDGFRβ, a marker of BBB breakdown) but have not demonstrated if this vascular impairment affects neuronal dysfunction. It's possible that increased levels of sPDGFRβ in the CSF may correlate with impaired FC in metabolically demanding brain regions (i.e. Default Mode Network, DMN). Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between these two markers in older individuals that were cognitively normal and had cognitive impairment. Eighty-nine older adults without dementia from the University of Southern California were selected from a larger cohort. Region of interest (ROI) to ROI analyses were conducted using DMN seed regions. Linear regression models measured significant associations between BOLD FC strength among seed-target regions and sPDGFRβ values, while covarying for age and sex. Comparison of a composite ROI created by averaging FC values between seed and all target regions among cognitively normal and impaired individuals was also examined. Using CSF sPDGFRβ as a biomarker of BBB breakdown, we report that increased breakdown correlated with decreased functional connectivity in DMN areas, specifically the PCC while the hippocampus exhibited an interaction effect using CDR score. We conclude that BBB breakdown as measured by CSF sPDGFRβ affects neural networks resulting in decreased functional connections that leads to cognitive dysfunction.",2023,BBB breakdown; cognitive impairment; default mode network (DMN); resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI); soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (sPDGFRβ),,"Contreras, JA; Fujisaki, K; Ortega, N; Barisano, G; Sagare, A; Pappas, I; Chui, H; Ringman, JM; Joe, EB; Zlokovic, B; Toga, AW; Pa, J"

Beyond the amyloid hypothesis: how current research implicates autoimmunity in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"The amyloid hypothesis has so far been at the forefront of explaining the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and eventual death. Recent evidence, however, points to additional factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. These include the neurovascular hypothesis, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, the prion hypothesis, the mutational accumulation hypothesis, and the autoimmunity hypothesis. The purpose of this review was to briefly discuss the factors that are associated with autoimmunity in humans, including sex, the gut and lung microbiomes, age, genetics, and environmental factors. Subsequently, it was to examine the rise of autoimmune phenomena in AD, which can be instigated by a blood-brain barrier breakdown, pathogen infections, and dysfunction of the glymphatic system. Lastly, it was to discuss the various ways by which immune system dysregulation leads to AD, immunomodulating therapies, and future directions in the field of autoimmunity and neurodegeneration. A comprehensive account of the recent research done in the field was extracted from PubMed on 31 January 2022, with the keywords ""Alzheimer's disease"" and ""autoantibodies"" for the first search input, and ""Alzheimer's disease"" with ""IgG"" for the second. From the first search, 19 papers were selected, because they contained recent research on the autoantibodies found in the biofluids of patients with AD. From the second search, four papers were selected. The analysis of the literature has led to support the autoimmune hypothesis in AD. Autoantibodies were found in biofluids (serum/plasma, cerebrospinal fluid) of patients with AD with multiple methods, including ELISA, Mass Spectrometry, and microarray analysis. Through continuous research, the understanding of the synergistic effects of the various components that lead to AD will pave the way for better therapeutic methods and a deeper understanding of the disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Autoantibodies; amyloid hypothesis; autoimmunity; biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Autoimmunity; Autoantibodies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Chatanaka, MK; Sohaei, D; Diamandis, EP; Prassas, I"

Plasma tau and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and their relation to cognitive functions.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia. The cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with this disorder often have overlapping characteristics, potentially resulting in delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. This study aimed to assess the level of peripheral blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) and total tau (t-tau) protein in AD patients and investigate their relationship with cognitive impairment. The study included 80 participants of both sexes between the ages of 60 to 85 years. The participants were divided into two groups, consisting of 40 individuals in the control group (mean age 75±6.6 years) who had no cognitive or functional impairments and 40 AD patients (mean age 74.98±5.03 years). This study utilized the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for major or mild neurocognitive disorder attributed to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The clinical and biochemical features of all participants were documented, and the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores were evaluated. Sandwich ELISA was employed to determine serum NfL and t-tau protein levels. The median serum NfL and t-tau protein levels in AD patients were significantly higher than those of the controls (47.84 pg/ml versus 17.66 pg/ml and 12.05 pg/ml versus 11.13 pg/ml, respectively). Age was positively correlated with NfL, t-tau levels, and ADAS-cog. Although elevated NfL and t-tau protein levels may play a role in disease progression, their diagnostic value for AD was limited.",2023,ADAS-cog; Alzheimer’s disease; neurofilament light chain; total tau protein,"Male; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Intermediate Filaments; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers","Abed, SS; Hamdan, FB; Hussein, MM; Al-Mayah, QS"

Molecularly imprinted polymers for the recognition of biomarkers of certain neurodegenerative diseases.,"The appearance of the biomarkers in body fluids like blood, urine, saliva, tears, etc. can be used for the identification of many diseases. This article aimed to summarize the studies about electrochemical biosensors with molecularly imprinted polymers as sensitive and selective layers on the electrode to detect protein-based biomarkers of such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stress. The main attention in this article is focused on the detection methods of amyloid-β oligomers and p-Tau which are representative biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein as the biomarker of Parkinson's disease, and α-amylase and lysozyme as the biomarkers of stress using molecular imprinting technology.

Sensitive label-free detection of the biomarker phosphorylated tau-217 protein in Alzheimer's disease using a graphene-based solution-gated field effect transistor.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is generally diagnosed using advanced imaging, but recent research suggests early screening using biomarkers in peripheral blood is feasible; among them, plasma tau proteins phosphorylated at threonine 231, threonine 181, and threonine 217 (p-tau217) are potential targets. A recent study indicates that the p-tau217 protein is the most efficacious biomarker. However, a clinical study found a pg/ml threshold for AD screening beyond standard detection methods. A biosensor with high sensitivity and specificity p-tau217 detection has not yet been reported. In this study, we developed a label-free solution-gated field effect transistor (SGFET)-based biosensor featuring a graphene oxide/graphene (GO/G) layered composite. The top layer of bilayer graphene grown using chemical vapor deposition was functionalized with oxidative groups serving as active sites for forming covalent bonds with the biorecognition element (antibodies); the bottom G could act as a transducer to respond to the attachment of the target analytes onto the top GO conjugated with the biorecognition element via π-π interactions between the GO and G layers. With this unique atomically layered G composite, we obtained a good linear electrical response in the Dirac point shift to p-tau217 protein concentrations in the range of 10 fg/ml to 100 pg/ml. The biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity of 18.6 mV/decade with a high linearity of 0.991 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); in human serum albumin, it showed approximately 90% of the sensitivity (16.7 mV/decade) in PBS, demonstrating high specificity. High stability of the biosensor was also displayed in this study.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Atomic layer oxidation; Immunosensor; Layered graphene composite; Solution-gated field-effect transistor; p-tau 217,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Biosensing Techniques; Graphite; Biomarkers,"Ciou, SH; Hsieh, AH; Lin, YX; Sei, JL; Govindasamy, M; Kuo, CF; Huang, CH"
Association of Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number With Brain MRI Markers and Cognitive Function: A Meta-analysis of Community-Based Cohorts.,"Previous studies suggest that lower mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (CN) is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether mtDNA CN in whole blood is related to endophenotypes of Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (AD/ADRD) needs further investigation.

Plasma phospho-tau in Alzheimer's disease: towards diagnostic and therapeutic trial applications.,"As the leading cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major burden on affected individuals, their families and caregivers, and healthcare systems. Although AD can be identified and diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid or neuroimaging biomarkers that concord with neuropathological evidence and clinical symptoms, challenges regarding practicality and accessibility hinder their widespread availability and implementation. Consequently, many people with suspected cognitive impairment due to AD do not receive a biomarker-supported diagnosis. Blood biomarkers have the capacity to help expand access to AD diagnostics worldwide. One such promising biomarker is plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau), which has demonstrated specificity to AD versus non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, and will be extremely important to inform on clinical diagnosis and eligibility for therapies that have recently been approved. This review provides an update on the diagnostic and prognostic performances of plasma p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231, and their associations with in vivo and autopsy-verified diagnosis and pathological hallmarks. Additionally, we discuss potential applications and unanswered questions of plasma p-tau for therapeutic trials, given their recent addition to the biomarker toolbox for participant screening, recruitment and during-trial monitoring. Outstanding questions include assay standardization, threshold generation and biomarker verification in diverse cohorts reflective of the wider community attending memory clinics and included in clinical trials.",2023,Alzheimer; Blood biomarker; Dementia; Phosphorylated tau; Plasma p-tau; s disease,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Neuropathology; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Gonzalez-Ortiz, F; Kac, PR; Brum, WS; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Karikari, TK"

Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias Summit 2022: National Research Priorities for the Investigation of Post-Traumatic Brain Injury Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) and otherwise classified post-traumatic neurodegeneration (PTND). Targeted research is needed to elucidate the circumstances and mechanisms through which TBI contributes to the initiation, development, and progression of AD/ADRD pathologies including multiple etiology dementia (MED). The National Institutes of Health hosts triennial ADRD summits to inform a national research agenda, and TBI was included for a second time in 2022. A multidisciplinary expert panel of TBI and dementia researchers was convened to re-evaluate the 2019 research recommendations for understanding TBI as an AD/ADRD risk factor and to assess current progress and research gaps in understanding post-TBI AD/ADRD. Refined and new recommendations were presented during the MED special topic session at the virtual ADRD Summit in March 2022. Final research recommendations incorporating broad stakeholder input are organized into four priority areas as follows: (1) Promote interdisciplinary collaboration and data harmonization to accelerate progress of rigorous, clinically meaningful research; (2) Characterize clinical and biological phenotypes of PTND associated with varied lifetime TBI histories in diverse populations to validate multimodal biomarkers; (3) Establish and enrich infrastructure to support multimodal longitudinal studies of individuals with varied TBI exposure histories and standardized methods including common data elements (CDEs) for ante-mortem and post-mortem clinical and neuropathological characterization; and (4) Support basic and translational research to elucidate mechanistic pathways, development, progression, and clinical manifestations of post-TBI AD/ADRDs.

Progress in blood biomarkers of subjective cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that gradually impairs cognitive functions. Recently, there has been a conceptual shift toward AD to view the disease as a continuum. Since AD is currently incurable, effective intervention to delay or prevent pathological cognitive decline may best target the early stages of symptomatic disease, such as subjective cognitive decline (SCD), in which cognitive function remains relatively intact. Diagnostic methods for identifying AD, such as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography, are invasive and expensive. Therefore, it is imperative to develop blood biomarkers that are sensitive, less invasive, easier to access, and more cost effective for AD diagnosis. This review aimed to summarize the current data on whether individuals with SCD differ reliably and effectively in subjective and objective performances compared to cognitively normal elderly individuals, and to find one or more convenient and accessible blood biomarkers so that researchers can identify SCD patients with preclinical AD in the population as soon as possible. Owing to the heterogeneity and complicated pathogenesis of AD, it is difficult to make reliable diagnoses using only a single blood marker. This review provides an overview of the progress achieved to date with the use of SCD blood biomarkers in patients with preclinical AD, highlighting the key areas of application and current challenges.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Biomarkers,"Yu, X; Shao, K; Wan, K; Li, T; Li, Y; Zhu, X; Han, Y"

Transferability of Alzheimer's disease progression subtypes to an independent population cohort.,"In the past, methods to subtype or biotype patients using brain imaging data have been developed. However, it is unclear whether and how these trained machine learning models can be successfully applied to population cohorts to study the genetic and lifestyle factors underpinning these subtypes. This work, using the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm, examines the generalisability of data-driven Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression models. We first compared SuStaIn models trained separately on Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) data and an AD-at-risk population constructed from the UK Biobank dataset. We further applied data harmonization techniques to remove cohort effects. Next, we built SuStaIn models on the harmonized datasets, which were then used to subtype and stage subjects in the other harmonized dataset. The first key finding is that three consistent atrophy subtypes were found in both datasets, which match the previously identified subtype progression patterns in AD: 'typical', 'cortical' and 'subcortical'. Next, the subtype agreement was further supported by high consistency in individuals' subtypes and stage assignment based on the different models: more than 92% of the subjects, with reliable subtype assignment in both ADNI and UK Biobank dataset, were assigned to an identical subtype under the model built on the different datasets. The successful transferability of AD atrophy progression subtypes across cohorts capturing different phases of disease development enabled further investigations of associations between AD atrophy subtypes and risk factors. Our study showed that (1) the average age is highest in the typical subtype and lowest in the subcortical subtype; (2) the typical subtype is associated with statistically more-AD-like cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers values in comparison to the other two subtypes; and (3) in comparison to the subcortical subtype, the cortical subtype subjects are more likely to associate with prescription of cholesterol and high blood pressure medications. In summary, we presented cross-cohort consistent recovery of AD atrophy subtypes, showing how the same subtypes arise even in cohorts capturing substantially different disease phases. Our study opened opportunities for future detailed investigations of atrophy subtypes with a broad range of early risk factors, which will potentially lead to a better understanding of the disease aetiology and the role of lifestyle and behaviour on AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Early risk factors; Modelling; Subtypes,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Brain; Atrophy; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Chen, H; Young, A; Oxtoby, NP; Barkhof, F; Alexander, DC; Altmann, A"

Fatty Acid Profile and Genetic Variants of Proteins Involved in Fatty Acid Metabolism Could Be Considered as Disease Predictor.,"Circulating fatty acids (FA) have an endogenous or exogenous origin and are metabolized under the effect of many enzymes. They play crucial roles in many mechanisms: cell signaling, modulation of gene expression, etc., which leads to the hypothesis that their perturbation could be the cause of disease development. FA in erythrocytes and plasma rather than dietary FA could be used as a biomarker for many diseases. Cardiovascular disease was associated with elevated trans FA and decreased DHA and EPA. Increased arachidonic acid and decreased Docosahexaenoic Acids (DHA) were associated with Alzheimer's disease. Low Arachidonic acid and DHA are associated with neonatal morbidities and mortality. Decreased saturated fatty acids (SFA), increased monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) (C18:2 n-6 and C20:3 n-6) are associated with cancer. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for enzymes implicated in FA metabolism are associated with disease development. FA desaturase (FADS1 and FADS2) polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease, Acute Coronary Syndrome, Autism spectrum disorder and obesity. Polymorphisms in FA elongase (ELOVL2) are associated with Alzheimer's disease, Autism spectrum disorder and obesity. FA-binding protein polymorphism is associated with dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, peripheral atherosclerosis combined with type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase polymorphisms are associated with diabetes, obesity and diabetic nephropathy.

Metal-Organic Frameworks as Sensors for Human Amyloid Diseases.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are versatile compounds with emergent applications in the fabrication of biosensors for amyloid diseases. They hold great potential in biospecimen protection and unprecedented probing capabilities for optical and redox receptors. In this Review, we summarize the main methodologies employed in the fabrication of MOF-based sensors for amyloid diseases and collect all available data in the literature related to their performance (detection range, limit of detection, recovery, time of analysis, among other parameters). Nowadays, MOF sensors have evolved to a point where they can, in some cases, outperform technologies employed in the detection of several amyloid biomarkers (amyloid β peptide, α-synuclein, insulin, procalcitonin, and prolactin) present in biological fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid and blood. A special emphasis has been given by researchers on Alzheimer's disease monitoring to the detriment of other amyloidosis that are underexploited despite their societal relevance (e.g., Parkinson's disease). There are still important obstacles to overcome in order to selectively detect the various peptide isoforms and soluble amyloid species associated with Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, MOF contrast agents for imaging peptide soluble oligomers in living humans are also scarce (if not nonexistent), and action in this direction is unquestionably required to clarify the contentious link between the amyloidogenic species and the disease, guiding research toward the most promising therapeutic strategies.",2023,"Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid biomarker; diagnostic; immunosensor; metal−organic frameworks, amyloid diseases, biosensor, amyloid inhibition",Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Parkinson Disease; Amyloidosis,"Leite, JP; Figueira, F; Mendes, RF; Almeida Paz, FA; Gales, L"

Molecular Biomarkers of Neuronal Injury in Epilepsy Shared with Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"In neurodegenerative diseases, changes in neuronal proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood are viewed as potential biomarkers of the primary pathology in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent reports suggest, however, that level of neuronal proteins in fluids also alters in several types of epilepsy in various age groups, including children. With increasing evidence supporting clinical and sub-clinical seizures in Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease, and in other less common neurodegenerative conditions, these findings call into question the specificity of neuronal protein response to neurodegenerative process and urge analysis of the effects of concomitant epilepsy and other comorbidities. In this article, we revisit the evidence for alterations in neuronal proteins in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid associated with epilepsy with and without neurodegenerative diseases.

Since the introduction of ultrasensitive assays, NfL has been developed into a widely used axonal damage marker of relevance to the diagnosis, prognostication, follow-up, and treatment monitoring of a range of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. The marker is increasingly used clinically, as well as in clinical trials. Even if we have validated precise, sensitive, and specific assays for NfL quantification in both cerebrospinal fluid and blood, there are analytical, as well as pre- and post-analytical aspects of the total NfL testing process, including biomarker interpretation, to consider. Although the biomarker is already in use in specialised clinical laboratory settings, a more general use requires some further work. In this review, we provide brief basic information and opinions on NfL as a biomarker of axonal injury in neurological diseases and pinpoint additional work needed to facilitate biomarker implementation in clinical practice.",2023,analytical phase; biomarkers; blood; cerebrospinal fluid; neurodegeneration; neurofilament light chain; neurological disease; post-analytical phase; pre-analytical phase,"Humans; Laboratories, Clinical; Intermediate Filaments; Neurofilament Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Nervous System Diseases","Arslan, B; Zetterberg, H"

Blood Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Implications for the Clinical Neurologist.,"Blood-based biomarkers offer a major advance in the clinical evaluation of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, research studies have reported robust assays of blood markers for the detection of amyloid and tau pathologies specific to Alzheimer disease (amyloid-β peptides, and p-tau) and nonspecific blood markers of neuronal (neurofilament light, β-synuclein, and ubiquitin-C-terminal-hydrolase-L1) and glial degeneration (glial fibrillary acidic protein) that can measure key pathophysiologic processes in several neurodegenerative diseases. In the near future, these markers may be used for screening, diagnosis, or disease and treatment response monitoring. Blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases have been rapidly implemented in research, and they have the potential to enter clinical use soon in different clinical settings.

Hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocyte responses to amyloid and tau pathologies.,"In Alzheimer's disease clinical research, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) released/leaked into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood is widely measured and perceived as a biomarker of reactive astrogliosis. However, it was demonstrated that GFAP levels differ in individuals presenting with amyloid-β (Aβ) or tau pathologies. The molecular underpinnings behind this specificity are little explored.

Systematic review of brain and blood lipidomics in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is based on invasive and expensive biomarkers. Regarding AD pathophysiological mechanisms, there is evidence of a link between AD and aberrant lipid homeostasis. Alterations in lipid composition have been observed in blood and brain samples, and transgenic mouse models represent a promising approach. Nevertheless, there is great variability among studies in mice for the determination of different types of lipids in targeted and untargeted methods. It could be explained by the different variables (model, age, sex, analytical technique), and experimental conditions used. The aim of this work is to review the studies on lipid alteration in brain tissue and blood samples from AD mouse models, focusing on different experimental parameters. As result, great disparity has been observed among the reviewed studies. Brain studies showed an increase in gangliosides, sphingomyelins, lysophospholipids and monounsaturated fatty acids and a decrease in sulfatides. In contrast, blood studies showed an increase in phosphoglycerides, sterols, diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a decrease in phospholipids, lysophospholipids and monounsaturated fatty acids. Thus, lipids are closely related to AD, and a consensus on lipidomics studies could be used as a diagnostic tool and providing insight into the mechanisms involved in AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Brain; Lipidomics; Lipids; Mouse model; Plasma,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Lipidomics; Lysophospholipids; Mice, Transgenic","Ferré-González, L; Lloret, A; Cháfer-Pericás, C"
"Serum neurofilament light chain, brain infarcts, and the risk of stroke: a prospective population-based cohort study.","Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a neuron-specific protein, has been related to several neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, elevated levels of NfL have also been observed in patients admitted to the hospital for stroke, suggesting that NfL as a biomarker may extend well beyond neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, using data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), a population-based cohort study, we prospectively investigated the association of serum NfL levels with incident stroke and brain infarcts. During a follow-up of 3603 person-years, 133 (16.3%) individuals developed incident stroke, including ischemic and hemorrhagic. The HR (95%CI) of incident stroke was 1.28 (95%CI 1.10-1.50) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase of log10 NfL serum levels. Compared to participants in the first tertile of NfL (i.e., lower levels), the risk of stroke was 1.68 times higher (95%CI 1.07-2.65) in those in the second tertile and 2.35 times higher (95%CI 1.45-3.81) in those in the third tertile of NfL. NfL levels were also positively associated with brain infarcts; 1-SD in log10 NfL levels was associated with 1.32 (95%CI 1.06-1.66) higher odds of one or more brain infarcts. These results suggest that NfL may serve as a biomarker of stroke in older adults.",2023,Brain infarcts; Epidemiology; Incidence; MRI; Neurofilament light chain; Stroke,Aged; Humans; Biomarkers; Brain Infarction; Cohort Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Prospective Studies; Stroke; Incidence,"Dhana, A; DeCarli, C; Aggarwal, NT; Dhana, K; Desai, P; Evans, DA; Rajan, KB"

Distinct CSF biomarker-associated DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects.,"Background Growing evidence has demonstrated that DNA methylation (DNAm) plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that DNAm differences can be detected in the blood of AD subjects. Most studies have correlated blood DNAm with the clinical diagnosis of AD in living individuals. However, as the pathophysiological process of AD can begin many years before the onset of clinical symptoms, there is often disagreement between neuropathology in the brain and clinical phenotypes. Therefore, blood DNAm associated with AD neuropathology, rather than with clinical data, would provide more relevant information on AD pathogenesis. Methods We performed a comprehensive analysis to identify blood DNAm associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathological biomarkers for AD.

Contributions of blood-brain barrier imaging to neurovascular unit pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays important roles in the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Its main role includes three kinds of functions: (1) to protect the central nervous system from blood-borne toxins and pathogens; (2) to regulate the exchange of substances between the brain parenchyma and capillaries; and (3) to clear metabolic waste and other neurotoxic compounds from the central nervous system into meningeal lymphatics and systemic circulation. Physiologically, the BBB belongs to the glymphatic system and the intramural periarterial drainage pathway, both of which are involved in clearing interstitial solutes such as β-amyloid proteins. Thus, the BBB is believed to contribute to preventing the onset and progression for Alzheimer's disease. Measurements of BBB function are essential toward a better understanding of Alzheimer's pathophysiology to establish novel imaging biomarkers and open new avenues of interventions for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The visualization techniques for capillary, cerebrospinal, and interstitial fluid dynamics around the neurovascular unit in living human brains have been enthusiastically developed. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent BBB imaging developments using advanced magnetic resonance imaging technologies in relation to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. First, we give an overview of the relationship between Alzheimer's pathophysiology and BBB dysfunction. Second, we provide a brief description about the principles of non-contrast agent-based and contrast agent-based BBB imaging methodologies. Third, we summarize previous studies that have reported the findings of each BBB imaging method in individuals with the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Fourth, we introduce a wide range of Alzheimer's pathophysiology in relation to BBB imaging technologies to advance our understanding of the fluid dynamics around the BBB in both clinical and preclinical settings. Finally, we discuss the challenges of BBB imaging techniques and suggest future directions toward clinically useful imaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; MRI; biomarker; blood–brain barrier; neurovascular unit,,"Uchida, Y; Kan, H; Sakurai, K; Oishi, K; Matsukawa, N"

Advanced Overview of Biomarkers and Techniques for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The development of early non-invasive diagnosis methods and identification of novel biomarkers are necessary for managing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and facilitating effective prognosis and treatment. AD has multi-factorial nature and involves complex molecular mechanism, which causes neuronal degeneration. The primary challenges in early AD detection include patient heterogeneity and lack of precise diagnosis at the preclinical stage. Several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarkers have been proposed to show excellent diagnosis ability by identifying tau pathology and cerebral amyloid beta (Aβ) for AD. Intense research endeavors are being made to develop ultrasensitive detection techniques and find potent biomarkers for early AD diagnosis. To mitigate AD worldwide, understanding various CSF biomarkers, blood biomarkers, and techniques that can be used for early diagnosis is imperative. This review attempts to provide information regarding AD pathophysiology, genetic and non-genetic factors associated with AD, several potential blood and CSF biomarkers, like neurofilament light, neurogranin, Aβ, and tau, along with biomarkers under development for AD detection. Besides, numerous techniques, such as neuroimaging, spectroscopic techniques, biosensors, and neuroproteomics, which are being explored to aid early AD detection, have been discussed.

Review of Technological Challenges in Personalised Medicine and Early Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by progressive neuron loss in specific brain areas. The most common are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; in both cases, diagnosis is based on clinical tests with limited capability to discriminate between similar neurodegenerative disorders and detect the early stages of the disease. It is common that by the time a patient is diagnosed with the disease, the level of neurodegeneration is already severe. Thus, it is critical to find new diagnostic methods that allow earlier and more accurate disease detection. This study reviews the methods available for the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and potentially interesting new technologies. Neuroimaging techniques are the most widely used in clinical practice, and new techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have significantly improved the diagnosis quality. Identifying biomarkers in peripheral samples such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid is a major focus of the current research on neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery of good markers could allow preventive screening to identify early or asymptomatic stages of the neurodegenerative process. These methods, in combination with artificial intelligence, could contribute to the generation of predictive models that will help clinicians in the early diagnosis, stratification, and prognostic assessment of patients, leading to improvements in patient treatment and quality of life.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; alpha-synuclein; beta-amyloid; biomarker; exosomes; imaging techniques; neuroinflammation; reactive antibodies,Humans; Precision Medicine; Artificial Intelligence; Quality of Life; Alzheimer Disease; Early Diagnosis; Biomarkers,"Domínguez-Fernández, C; Egiguren-Ortiz, J; Razquin, J; Gómez-Galán, M; De Las Heras-García, L; Paredes-Rodríguez, E; Astigarraga, E; Miguélez, C; Barreda-Gómez, G"

Screening for PTSD and TBI in Veterans using Routine Clinical Laboratory Blood Tests.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder diagnosed by clinical interviews, self-report measures and neuropsychological testing. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have neuropsychiatric symptoms similar to PTSD. Diagnosing PTSD and TBI is challenging and more so for providers lacking specialized training facing time pressures in primary care and other general medical settings. Diagnosis relies heavily on patient self-report and patients frequently under-report or over-report their symptoms due to stigma or seeking compensation. We aimed to create objective diagnostic screening tests utilizing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) blood tests available in most clinical settings. CLIA blood test results were ascertained in 475 male veterans with and without PTSD and TBI following warzone exposure in Iraq or Afghanistan. Using random forest (RF) methods, four classification models were derived to predict PTSD and TBI status. CLIA features were selected utilizing a stepwise forward variable selection RF procedure. The AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.730, 0.706, 0.659, and 0.715, respectively for differentiating PTSD and healthy controls (HC), 0.704, 0.677, 0.671, and 0.681 for TBI vs. HC, 0.739, 0.742, 0.635, and 0.766 for PTSD comorbid with TBI vs HC, and 0.726, 0.723, 0.636, and 0.747 for PTSD vs. TBI. Comorbid alcohol abuse, major depressive disorder, and BMI are not confounders in these RF models. Markers of glucose metabolism and inflammation are among the most significant CLIA features in our models.

Bioinformatics investigation on blood-based gene expressions of Alzheimer's disease revealed ORAI2 gene biomarker susceptibility: An explainable artificial intelligence-based approach.,"The progressive, chronic nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a form of dementia, defaces the adulthood of elderly individuals. The pathogenesis of the condition is primarily unascertained, turning the treatment efficacy more arduous. Therefore, understanding the genetic etiology of AD is essential to identifying targeted therapeutics. This study aimed to use machine-learning techniques of expressed genes in patients with AD to identify potential biomarkers that can be used for future therapy. The dataset is accessed from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (Accession Number: GSE36980). The subgroups (AD blood samples from frontal, hippocampal, and temporal regions) are individually investigated against non-AD models. Prioritized gene cluster analyses are conducted with the STRING database. The candidate gene biomarkers were trained with various supervised machine-learning (ML) classification algorithms. The interpretation of the model prediction is perpetrated with explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This experiment revealed 34, 60, and 28 genes as target biomarkers of AD mapped from the frontal, hippocampal, and temporal regions. It is identified ORAI2 as a shared biomarker in all three areas strongly associated with AD's progression. The pathway analysis showed that STIM1 and TRPC3 are strongly associated with ORAI2. We found three hub genes, TPI1, STIM1, and TRPC3, in the network of the ORAI2 gene that might be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of AD. Naive Bayes classified the samples of different groups by fivefold cross-validation with 100% accuracy. AI and ML are promising tools in identifying disease-associated genes that will advance the field of targeted therapeutics against genetic diseases.",2023,Alzheimer's; Artificial Intelligence; Biomarkers; Genetic Algorithm; Machine Learning; ORAI2; STIM2,Humans; Adult; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Computational Biology; Biomarkers; Gene Expression; ORAI2 Protein,"Sekaran, K; Alsamman, AM; George Priya Doss, C; Zayed, H"
Brain-Penetrating and Disease Site-Targeting Manganese Dioxide-Polymer-Lipid Hybrid Nanoparticles Remodel Microenvironment of Alzheimer's Disease by Regulating Multiple Pathological Pathways.,"Finding effective disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease remains challenging due to an array of factors contributing to the loss of neural function. The current study demonstrates a new strategy, using multitargeted bioactive nanoparticles to modify the brain microenvironment to achieve therapeutic benefits in a well-characterized mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The application of brain-penetrating manganese dioxide nanoparticles significantly reduces hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress; ultimately reducing levels of amyloid β plaques within the neocortex. Analyses of molecular biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging-based functional studies indicate that these effects improve microvessel integrity, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral lymphatic clearance of amyloid β. These changes collectively shift the brain microenvironment toward conditions more favorable to continued neural function as demonstrated by improved cognitive function following treatment. Such multimodal disease-modifying treatment may bridge critical gaps in the therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative disease.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; brain microenvironment; nanomedicine; neuroinflammation; oxidative stress; vascular function,Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Cell Hypoxia; Drug Delivery Systems; Lipids; Metal Nanoparticles; Oxidative Stress; Polymers; Brain,"Park, E; Li, LY; He, C; Abbasi, AZ; Ahmed, T; Foltz, WD; O'Flaherty, R; Zain, M; Bonin, RP; Rauth, AM; Fraser, PE; Henderson, JT; Wu, XY"

"Vascular-water-exchange MRI (VEXI) enables the detection of subtle AXR alterations in Alzheimer's disease without MRI contrast agent, which may relate to BBB integrity.","Blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment is an important pathophysiological process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. However, most current neuroimaging methods assessing BBB function need the injection of exogenous contrast agents (or tracers), which limits the application of these methods in a large population. In this study, we aim to explore the feasibility of vascular water exchange MRI (VEXI), a diffusion-MRI-based method proposed to assess the BBB permeability to water molecules without using a contrast agent, in the detection of the BBB breakdown in AD. We tested VEXI on a 3T MRI scanner on three groups: AD patients (AD group), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients due to AD (MCI group), and the age-matched normal cognition subjects (NC group). Interestingly, we find that the apparent water exchange across the BBB (AXR",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Blood-brain barrier; contrast-agent-free; permeability; water exchange,Humans; Blood-Brain Barrier; Alzheimer Disease; Contrast Media; Water; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Zhang, Y; Wang, Y; Li, Z; Wang, Z; Cheng, J; Bai, X; Hsu, YC; Sun, Y; Li, S; Shi, J; Sui, B; Bai, R"
"Bloodborne Pancreatic Amylin, A Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathology has been linked to brain accumulation of β amyloid (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tau tangles. An intriguing question is whether targeting therapeutically factors independent of Aβ and tau pathologies could delay or even stop neurodegeneration. Amylin, a pancreatic hormone co-secreted with insulin, is believed to play a role in the central regulation of satiation and was shown to form pancreatic amyloid in persons with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that amyloid-forming amylin secreted from the pancreas synergistically aggregates with vascular and parenchymal Aβ in the brain, in both sporadic and early-onset familial AD. Pancreatic expression of amyloid-forming human amylin in AD-model rats accelerates AD-like pathology, whereas genetically suppressed amylin secretion protects against AD effects. Thus, current data suggest a role of pancreatic amyloid-forming amylin in modifying AD; further research is required to test whether lowering circulating amylin levels early during AD pathogenesis may curb cognitive decline.",2023,Alzheimer disease; amylin; amyloid; blood biomarkers; islet amyloid polypeptide; therapeutic targetes,,"Despa, F"
Comparison of ultrasensitive and mass spectrometry quantification of blood-based amyloid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in a memory clinic cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with β-amyloid pathology as a key underlying process. The relevance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain imaging biomarkers is validated in clinical practice for early diagnosis. Yet, their cost and perceived invasiveness are a limitation for large-scale implementation. Based on positive amyloid profiles, blood-based biomarkers should allow to detect people at risk for AD and to monitor patients under therapeutics strategies.

Blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker changes in patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment treated with lithium: analysis from a randomised placebo-controlled trial.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, ART does not completely halt or reverse the pathological processes behind HAND. Adjuvant mitigating treatments are, therefore, prudent. Lithium treatment is known to promote neuronal brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF). Lithium is also an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3-β). We analyzed biomarkers obtained from participants in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of lithium in ART-treated individuals with moderate or severe HAND. We assayed markers at baseline and 24 weeks across several pathways hypothesized to be affected by HIV, inflammation, or degeneration. Investigated biomarkers included dopamine, BDNF, neurofilament light chain, and CD8 + lymphocyte activation (CD38 + HLADR +). Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers included soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha and beta (sAPPα/β), Aβ38, 40, 42, and ten other biomarkers validated as predictors of mild cognitive impairment and progression in previous studies. These include apolipoprotein C3, pre-albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α1-antitrypsin, PEDF, CC4, ICAM-1, RANTES, clusterin, and cystatin c. We recruited 61 participants (placebo = 31; lithium = 30). The age baseline mean was 40 (± 8.35) years and the median CD4 + T-cell count was 498 (IQR: 389-651) cells/μL. Biomarker concentrations between groups did not differ at baseline. However, both groups' blood dopamine levels decreased significantly after 24 weeks (adj. p < 002). No other marker was significantly different between groups, and we concluded that lithium did not confer neuroprotection following 24 weeks of treatment.

Predicting amyloid PET and tau PET stages with plasma biomarkers.,"Staging the severity of Alzheimer's disease pathology using biomarkers is useful for therapeutic trials and clinical prognosis. Disease staging with amyloid and tau PET has face validity; however, this would be more practical with plasma biomarkers. Our objectives were, first, to examine approaches for staging amyloid and tau PET and, second, to examine prediction of amyloid and tau PET stages using plasma biomarkers. Participants (n = 1136) were enrolled in either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center; had a concurrent amyloid PET, tau PET and blood draw; and met clinical criteria for cognitively unimpaired (n = 864), mild cognitive impairment (n = 148) or Alzheimer's clinical syndrome with dementia (n = 124). The latter two groups were combined into a cognitively impaired group (n = 272). We used multinomial regression models to estimate discrimination [concordance (C) statistics] among three amyloid PET stages (low, intermediate, high), four tau PET stages (Braak 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6) and a combined amyloid and tau PET stage (none/low versus intermediate/high severity) using plasma biomarkers as predictors separately within unimpaired and impaired individuals. Plasma analytes, p-tau181, Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 (analysed as the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain were measured on the HD-X Simoa Quanterix platform. Plasma p-tau217 was also measured in a subset (n = 355) of cognitively unimpaired participants using the Lilly Meso Scale Discovery assay. Models with all Quanterix plasma analytes along with risk factors (age, sex and APOE) most often provided the best discrimination among amyloid PET stages (C = 0.78-0.82). Models with p-tau181 provided similar discrimination of tau PET stages to models with all four plasma analytes (C = 0.72-0.85 versus C = 0.73-0.86). Discriminating a PET proxy of intermediate/high from none/low Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change with all four Quanterix plasma analytes was excellent but not better than p-tau181 only (C = 0.88 versus 0.87 for unimpaired and C = 0.91 versus 0.90 for impaired). Lilly p-tau217 outperformed the Quanterix p-tau181 assay for discriminating high versus intermediate amyloid (C = 0.85 versus 0.74) but did not improve over a model with all Quanterix plasma analytes and risk factors (C = 0.85 versus 0.83). Plasma analytes along with risk factors can discriminate between amyloid and tau PET stages and between a PET surrogate for intermediate/high versus none/low neuropathological change with accuracy in the acceptable to excellent range. Combinations of plasma analytes are better than single analytes for many staging predictions with the exception that Quanterix p-tau181 alone usually performed equivalently to combinations of Quanterix analytes for tau PET discrimination.",2023,Alzheimer’s biomarkers; amyloid PET; plasma biomarkers; staging Alzheimer’s disease; tau PET,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Biomarkers; Aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Jack, CR; Wiste, HJ; Algeciras-Schimnich, A; Figdore, DJ; Schwarz, CG; Lowe, VJ; Ramanan, VK; Vemuri, P; Mielke, MM; Knopman, DS; Graff-Radford, J; Boeve, BF; Kantarci, K; Cogswell, PM; Senjem, ML; Gunter, JL; Therneau, TM; Petersen, RC"
Plasma extracellular vesicles reveal early molecular differences in amyloid positive patients with early-onset mild cognitive impairment.,"In the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) development, the dementia phase is commonly preceded by a prodromal AD phase, which is mainly characterized by reaching the highest levels of Aβ and p-tau-mediated neuronal injury and a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) clinical status. Because of that, most AD cases are diagnosed when neuronal damage is already established and irreversible. Therefore, a differential diagnosis of MCI causes in these prodromal stages is one of the greatest challenges for clinicians. Blood biomarkers are emerging as desirable tools for pre-screening purposes, but the current results are still being analyzed and much more data is needed to be implemented in clinical practice. Because of that, plasma extracellular vesicles (pEVs) are gaining popularity as a new source of biomarkers for the early stages of AD development. To identify an exosome proteomics signature linked to prodromal AD, we performed a cross-sectional study in a cohort of early-onset MCI (EOMCI) patients in which 184 biomarkers were measured in pEVs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma samples using multiplex PEA technology of Olink",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Extracellular vesicles; Mild cognitive impairment; Plasma exosomes; Proteomics,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cross-Sectional Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Cano, A; Esteban-de-Antonio, E; Bernuz, M; Puerta, R; García-González, P; de Rojas, I; Olivé, C; Pérez-Cordón, A; Montrreal, L; Núñez-Llaves, R; Sotolongo-Grau, Ó; Alarcón-Martín, E; Valero, S; Alegret, M; Martín, E; Martino-Adami, PV; Ettcheto, M; Camins, A; Vivas, A; Gomez-Chiari, M; Tejero, MÁ; Orellana, A; Tárraga, L; Marquié, M; Ramírez, A; Martí, M; Pividori, MI; Boada, M; Ruíz, A"
Modifications of the endosomal compartment in fibroblasts from sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients are associated with cognitive impairment.,"Morphological alterations of the endosomal compartment have been widely described in post-mortem brains from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and subjects with Down syndrome (DS) who are at high risk for AD. Immunostaining with antibodies against endosomal markers such as Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) revealed increased size of EEA1-positive puncta. In DS, peripheral cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and fibroblasts, share similar phenotype even in the absence of AD. We previously found that PBMCs from AD patients have larger EEA1-positive puncta, correlating with brain amyloid load. Here we analysed the endosomal compartment of fibroblasts from a very well characterised cohort of AD patients (IMABio3) who underwent thorough clinical, imaging and biomarkers assessments. Twenty-one subjects were included (7 AD with mild cognitive impairment (AD-MCI), 7 AD with dementia (AD-D) and 7 controls) who had amyloid-PET at baseline (PiB) and neuropsychological tests at baseline and close to skin biopsy. Fibroblasts isolated from skin biopsies were immunostained with anti-EEA1 antibody and imaged using a spinning disk microscope. Endosomal compartment ultrastructure was also analysed by electron microscopy. All fibroblast lines were genotyped and their AD risk factors identified. Our results show a trend to an increased EEA1-positive puncta volume in fibroblasts from AD-D as compared to controls (p.adj = 0.12) and reveal enhanced endosome area in fibroblasts from AD-MCI and AD-AD versus controls. Larger puncta size correlated with PiB retention in different brain areas and with worse cognitive scores at the time of biopsy as well as faster decline from baseline to the time of biopsy. Finally, we identified three genetic risk factors for AD (ABCA1, COX7C and MYO15A) that were associated with larger EEA1 puncta volume. In conclusion, the endosomal compartment in fibroblasts could be used as cellular peripheral biomarker for both amyloid deposition and cognitive decline in AD patients.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Endosomes; Fibroblasts; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Positron-Emission Tomography","Xicota, L; Lagarde, J; Eysert, F; Grenier-Boley, B; Rivals, I; Botté, A; Forlani, S; Landron, S; Gautier, C; Gabriel, C; Bottlaender, M; Lambert, JC; Chami, M; Sarazin, M; Potier, MC"
"Extracellular vesicles, the emerging mirrors of brain physiopathology.","Extracellular vesicles are secreted by a wide variety of cells, and their primary functions include intercellular communication, immune responses, human reproduction, and synaptic plasticity. Their molecular cargo reflects the physiological processes that their cells of origin are undergoing. Thus, many studies have suggested that extracellular vesicles could be a promising biomarker tool for many diseases, mainly due to their biological relevance and easy accessibility to a broad range of body fluids. Moreover, since their biological composition leads them to cross the blood-brain barrier bidirectionally, growing evidence points to extracellular vesicles as emerging mirrors of brain diseases processes. In this regard, this review explores the biogenesis and biological functions of extracellular vesicles, their role in different physiological and pathological processes, their potential in clinical practice, and the recent outstanding studies about the role of exosomes in major human brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or brain tumors.",2023,"Alzheimer's disease; Exosomes; Parkinson's disease; extracellular vesicles; glioblastoma; multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; neurodegenerative diseases",Humans; Extracellular Vesicles; Exosomes; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier,"Cano, A; Ettcheto, M; Bernuz, M; Puerta, R; Esteban de Antonio, E; Sánchez-López, E; Souto, EB; Camins, A; Martí, M; Pividori, MI; Boada, M; Ruiz, A"
"A meta-analysis investigating the relationship between inflammation in autoimmune disease, elevated CRP, and the risk of dementia.","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) represents the most common type of dementia and is becoming a steadily increasing challenge for health systems globally. Inflammation is developing as the main focus of research into Alzheimer's disease and has been demonstrated to be a major driver of the pathologies associated with AD. This evidence introduces an interesting research question, whether chronic inflammation due to pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) could lead to a higher risk of developing dementia. In both IBD and RA, increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP) can be highlighted, the latter being directly implicated in neuroinflammation and AD. In this meta-analysis both the association between chronic inflammatory diseases and elevated levels of CRP during midlife were investigated to examine if they correlated with an augmented risk of dementia. Moreover, the association between increased CRP and modifications in the permeability of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) in the presence of CRP is explored. The results displayed that the odds ratio for IBD and dementia was 1.91 [1.15-3.15], for RA it was 1.90 [1.09-3.32] following sensitivity analysis and for CRP it was 1.62 [1.22-2.15]. These results demonstrate a higher risk of dementia in patients presenting chronic inflammation and that exists an independent association with high CRP in midlife. This paper builds on published research that suggest a critical role for CRP both in stroke and AD and provides an analysis on currently published research on multiple diseases (IBD and RA) in which CRP is raised as well as chronically elevated. CRP and the associated risk of dementia and further research indicated that the monomeric form of CRP can infiltrate the BBB/be released from damaged micro-vessels to access the brain. This meta-analysis provides first-time evidence that chronic elevation of CRP in autoimmune diseases is directly associated with an increased risk of later development of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, greater priority should be provided to the effective control of inflammation in patients with chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions and further long-term assessment of circulating CRP might inform of an individual's relative risk of developing dementia.",2023,C-reactive protein; autoimmune; dementia; inflammatory disease; meta - analysis,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Inflammation; Autoimmune Diseases; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; C-Reactive Protein; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","Cooper, J; Pastorello, Y; Slevin, M"

Dietary Responses of Dementia-Related Genes Encoding Metabolic Enzymes.,"The age-related loss of the cognitive function is a growing concern for global populations. Many factors that determine cognitive resilience or dementia also have metabolic functions. However, this duality is not universally appreciated when the action of that factor occurs in tissues external to the brain. Thus, we examined a set of genes involved in dementia, i.e., those related to vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and the human metabolism for activity in 12 metabolically active tissues. Mining the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data showed that most of these metabolism-dementia (MD) genes (62 of 93, 67%) exhibit a higher median expression in any of the metabolically active tissues than in the brain. After identifying that several MD genes served as blood-based biomarkers of longevity in other studies, we examined the impact of the intake of food, nutrients, and other dietary factors on the expression of MD genes in whole blood in the Framingham Offspring Study (",2023,dementia; diet; flavonoids; gene–diet interaction; metabolic enzyme; taurine,"Humans; Diet; Alzheimer Disease; Dementia, Vascular; Brain; Cognition","Parnell, LD; Magadmi, R; Zwanger, S; Shukitt-Hale, B; Lai, CQ; Ordovás, JM"
Cyclic Glycine-Proline (cGP) Normalises Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) Function: Clinical Significance in the Ageing Brain and in Age-Related Neurological Conditions.,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) function declines with age and is associated with brain ageing and the progression of age-related neurological conditions. The reversible binding of IGF-1 to IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 regulates the amount of bioavailable, functional IGF-1 in circulation. Cyclic glycine-proline (cGP), a metabolite from the binding site of IGF-1, retains its affinity for IGFBP-3 and competes against IGF-1 for IGFBP-3 binding. Thus, cGP and IGFBP-3 collectively regulate the bioavailability of IGF-1. The molar ratio of cGP/IGF-1 represents the amount of bioavailable and functional IGF-1 in circulation. The cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio is low in patients with age-related conditions, including hypertension, stroke, and neurological disorders with cognitive impairment. Stroke patients with a higher cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio have more favourable clinical outcomes. The elderly with more cGP have better memory retention. An increase in the cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio with age is associated with normal cognition, whereas a decrease in this ratio with age is associated with dementia in Parkinson disease. In addition, cGP administration reduces systolic blood pressure, improves memory, and aids in stroke recovery. These clinical and experimental observations demonstrate the role of cGP in regulating IGF-1 function and its potential clinical applications in age-related brain diseases as a plasma biomarker for-and an intervention to improve-IGF-1 function.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; ageing brain; cyclic glycine-proline (cGP); insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) function; stroke,Humans; Aged; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Clinical Relevance; Nervous System Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Stroke; Brain; Aging,"Guan, J; Li, F; Kang, D; Anderson, T; Pitcher, T; Dalrymple-Alford, J; Shorten, P; Singh-Mallah, G"
Endothelial Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The cerebral vascular system stringently regulates cerebral blood flow (CBF). The components of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) protect the brain from pathogenic infections and harmful substances, efflux waste, and exchange substances; however, diseases develop in cases of blood vessel injuries and BBB dysregulation. Vascular pathology is concurrent with the mechanisms underlying aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD), which suggests its involvement in these mechanisms. Therefore, in the present study, we reviewed the role of vascular dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD and VaD. During the development of the aforementioned diseases, changes occur in the cerebral blood vessel morphology and local cells, which, in turn, alter CBF, fluid dynamics, and vascular integrity. Chronic vascular inflammation and blood vessel dysregulation further exacerbate vascular dysfunction. Multitudinous pathogenic processes affect the cerebrovascular system, whose dysfunction causes cognitive impairment. Knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying molecular mechanisms may lead to the discovery of clinically relevant vascular biomarkers, which may facilitate vascular imaging for disease prevention and treatment.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); blood–brain barrier (BBB); cerebral blood flow (CBF); vascular dementia (VaD),"Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Dementia, Vascular; Blood-Brain Barrier; Vascular Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction","Fang, YC; Hsieh, YC; Hu, CJ; Tu, YK"

Emerging literature provides insight into the mechanisms behind the liver-brain health axis. These include the increased production of liver-derived factors that promote insulin resistance and loss of neuroprotective factors under conditions of NAFLD that increase insulin resistance in the central nervous system. In addition, elevated proinflammatory cytokines linked to NAFLD negatively impact the blood-brain barrier and increase neuroinflammation. Furthermore, exacerbated dyslipidemia associated with NAFLD and hepatic dysfunction can promote altered brain bioenergetics and oxidative stress. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the crosstalk between liver and brain as it relates to the pathophysiology between NAFLD and neurodegeneration, with an emphasis on Alzheimer's disease. We also highlight knowledge gaps and future areas for investigation to strengthen the potential link between NAFLD and neurodegeneration.",2023,,Humans; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Insulin Resistance; Liver; Biomarkers; Cytokines,"Kelty, TJ; Dashek, RJ; Arnold, WD; Rector, RS"

"Virus-Like Cytosolic and Cell-Free Oxidatively Damaged Nucleic Acids Likely Drive Inflammation, Synapse Degeneration, and Neuron Death in Alzheimer's Disease.","Oxidative stress, inflammation, and amyloid-β are Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks that cause each other and other AD hallmarks. Most amyloid-β-lowering, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial AD clinical trials failed; none stopped or reversed AD. Although signs suggest an infectious etiology, no pathogen accumulated consistently in AD patients. Neuropathology, neuronal cell culture, rodent, genome-wide association, epidemiological, biomarker, and clinical studies, plus analysis using Hill causality criteria and revised Koch's postulates, indicate that the virus-like oxidative damage-associated molecular-pattern (DAMP) cytosolic and cell-free nucleic acids accumulated in AD patients' brains likely drive neuroinflammation, synaptotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Cytosolic oxidatively-damaged mitochondrial DNA accumulated outside mitochondria dose-dependently in preclinical AD and AD patients' hippocampal neurons, and in AD patients' neocortical neurons but not cerebellar neurons or glia. In oxidatively-stressed neural cells and rodents' brains, cytosolic oxidatively-damaged mitochondrial DNA accumulated and increased antiviral and inflammatory proteins, including cleaved caspase-1, interleukin-1β, and interferon-β. Cytosolic double-stranded RNA and DNA are DAMPs that induce antiviral interferons and/or inflammatory proteins by oligomerizing with various innate-immune pattern-recognition receptors, e.g., cyclic GMP-AMP synthase and the nucleotide-binding-oligomerization-domain-like-receptor-pyrin-domain-containing-3 inflammasome. In oxidatively-stressed neural cells, cytosolic oxidatively-damaged mitochondrial DNA caused synaptotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Depleting mitochondrial DNA prevented these effects. Additionally, cell-free nucleic acids accumulated in AD patients' blood, extracellular vesicles, and senile plaques. Injecting cell-free nucleic acids bound to albumin oligomers into wild-type mice's hippocampi triggered antiviral interferon-β secretion; interferon-β injection caused synapse degeneration. Deoxyribonuclease-I treatment appeared to improve a severe-AD patient's Mini-Mental Status Exam by 15 points.

"Alzheimer's disease with sleep insufficiency: a cross-sectional study on correlations among clinical characteristics, orexin, its receptors, and the blood-brain barrier.","Previous studies have shown that reduced sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and decreased sleep quality in patients with Alzheimer's disease are related to dysfunction in orexin signaling. At the same time, blood-brain barrier disruption is considered an early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. However, currently no report has examined how changes in orexin signaling relate to changes in the blood-brain barrier of patients who have Alzheimer's disease with sleep insufficiency. This cross-sectional study included 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease who received treatment in 2019 at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups: those with insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤ 6 hours, n = 19, age 61.58 ± 8.54 years, 10 men) and those with normal sleep durations (sleep duration > 6 hours, n = 31, age 63.19 ± 10.09 years, 18 men). Demographic variables were collected to evaluate cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living. The levels of orexin, its receptor proteins, and several blood-brain barrier factors were measured in cerebrospinal fluid. Sleep insufficiency was associated with impaired overall cognitive function that spanned multiple cognitive domains. Furthermore, levels of orexin and its receptors were upregulated in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the blood-brain barrier was destroyed. Both these events precipitated each other and accelerated the progression of Alzheimer's disease. These findings describe the clinical characteristics and potential mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease accompanied by sleep deprivation. Inhibiting the upregulation of elements within the orexin system or preventing the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier could thus be targets for treating Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood-brain barrier; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical characteristics; cognitive function; matrix metalloproteinase-3; matrix metalloproteinases; neuropsychiatric symptoms; orexin signaling; sleep insufficiency,,"Guo, P; Zhang, WJ; Lian, TH; Zhang, WJ; He, MY; Zhang, YN; Huang, Y; Ding, DY; Guan, HY; Li, JH; Li, DN; Luo, DM; Zhang, WJ; Yue, H; Wang, XM; Zhang, W"
Plasma proteins related to inflammatory diet predict future cognitive impairment.,"Dysregulation of the immune system and dietary patterns that increase inflammation can increase the risk for cognitive decline, but the mechanisms by which inflammatory nutritional habits may affect the development of cognitive impairment in aging are not well understood. To determine whether plasma proteins linked to inflammatory diet predict future cognitive impairment, we applied high-throughput proteomic assays to plasma samples from a subset (n = 1528) of Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) participants (mean [SD] baseline age, 71.3 [SD 3.8] years). Results provide insights into how inflammatory nutritional patterns are associated with an immune-related proteome and identify a group of proteins (CXCL10, CCL3, HGF, OPG, CDCP1, NFATC3, ITGA11) related to future cognitive impairment over a 14-year follow-up period. Several of these inflammatory diet proteins were also associated with dementia risk across two external cohorts (ARIC, ESTHER), correlated with plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (Aβ",2023,,"Humans; Female; Aged; Proteomics; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diet; Blood Proteins; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cell Adhesion Molecules","Duggan, MR; Butler, L; Peng, Z; Daya, GN; Moghekar, A; An, Y; Rapp, SR; Hayden, KM; Shadyab, AH; Natale, G; Liu, L; Snetselaar, L; Moaddel, R; Rebholz, CM; Sullivan, K; Ballantyne, CM; Resnick, SM; Ferrucci, L; Walker, KA"
"Circulating cardiac biomarkers, structural brain changes, and dementia: Emerging insights and perspectives.","Diseases of the heart and brain are strongly linked to each other, and cardiac dysfunction is associated with cognitive decline and dementia. This link between cardiovascular disease and dementia offers opportunities for dementia prevention through prevention and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and heart disease. Increasing evidence suggests the clinical utility of cardiac biomarkers as risk markers for structural brain changes and cognitive impairment. We propose the hypothesis that structural brain changes are the link between impaired cardiac function, as captured by blood-based cardiac biomarkers, and cognitive impairment. This review provides an overview of the literature and illustrates emerging insights into the association of markers of hemodynamic stress (natriuretic peptides) and markers of myocardial injury (cardiac troponins) with imaging findings of brain damage and cognitive impairment or dementia. Based on these findings, we discuss potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association of cardiac biomarkers with structural brain changes and dementia. We suggest testable hypotheses and a research plan to close the gaps in understanding the mechanisms linking vascular damage and neurodegeneration, and to pave the way for targeted effective interventions for dementia prevention. From a clinical perspective, cardiac biomarkers open the window for early identification of patients at risk of dementia, who represent a target population for preventive interventions targeting modifiable cardiovascular risk factors to avert cognitive decline and dementia.",2023,circulating cardiac biomarkers; cognitive impairment; dementia; prevention; review; structural brain changes,Humans; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Heart Diseases; Dementia; Biomarkers,"Jensen, M; Zeller, T; Twerenbold, R; Thomalla, G"

Behavioral and cognitive performance of humanized APOEε3/ε3 liver mice in relation to plasma apolipoprotein E levels.,"Plasma apolipoprotein E levels were previously associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), levels of cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, cognition and imaging brain measures. Outside the brain, the liver is the primary source of apoE and liver transplantation studies have demonstrated that liver-derived apoE does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. How hepatic apoE may be implicated in behavioral and cognitive performance is not clear. In the current study, we behaviorally tested FRGN mice with humanized liver harboring the ε3/ε3 genotype (E3-human liver (HL)) and compared their behavioral and cognitive performance with that of age-matched ε3/ε3 targeted replacement (E3-TR) mice, the latter produces human apoE3 throughout the body whereas the E3-HL mice endogenously produce human apoE3 only in the liver. We also compared the liver weights and plasma apoE levels, and assessed whether plasma apoE levels were correlated with behavioral or cognitive measures in both models. E3-HL were more active but performed cognitively worse than E3-TR mice. E3-HL mice moved more in the open field containing objects, showed higher activity levels in the Y maze, showed higher activity levels during the baseline period in the fear conditioning test than E3-TR mice, and swam faster than E3-TR mice during training to locate the visible platform in the water maze. However, E3-HL mice showed reduced spatial memory retention in the water maze and reduced fear learning and contextual and cued fear memory than E3-TR mice. Liver weights were greater in E3-HL than E3-TR mice and sex-dependent only in the latter model. Plasma apoE3 levels were similar to those found in humans and comparable in female and male E3-TR mice but higher in female E3-HL mice. Finally, we found correlations between plasma apoE levels and behavioral and cognitive measures which were predominantly model-dependent. Our study demonstrates mouse-model dependent associations between plasma apoE levels, behavior and cognition in an 'AD-neutral' setting and suggests that a humanized liver might be sufficient to induce mouse behavioral and cognitive phenotypes.",2023,,Female; Male; Animals; Humans; Mice; Apolipoprotein E3; Liver; Apolipoproteins E; Cognition; Brain; Alzheimer Disease,"Kessler, K; Giannisis, A; Bial, G; Foquet, L; Nielsen, HM; Raber, J"
Profiling microRNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) refer to short in-length, noncoding RNAs that regulate numerous cellular functions by targeting mRNA, and numerous types of research have shown that miRNA is vitalin Alzheimer's disease. For identifying differentially expressed miRNAs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD), we conducted this study which might give a reference for potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for this disease. On the basis of high-throughput sequencing, we screened the miRNAs expression profiles in PBMC regarding both EOFAD patients and healthy controls, and the biological information was analyzed. Compared with the PBMC of healthy controls, 142 miRNAs were differentially expressed in EOFAD patients ( P  < 0.05), including 48 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs, 37 of which were significantly upregulated, including miR-3614-5p, miR-193A-5p, miR-2115-5p, miR-143-3p, etc. and 11 were significantly downregulated, including miR-484, miR-708-5p, miR-205-5p, miR-31-5p, etc. According to biological information analysis, 768 miRNA target genes were differentially expressed, which may be involved in multiple gene functions and cell cycle, cell senescence, and several signaling pathways, including FoxO, MAPK, Ras, mTOR, neurotrophin, etc. There are differential expressions of miRNAs in PBMC of EOFAD patients and controls, revealing their importance in Alzheimer's disease as indicated by co-expression network analysis; this may support basic information for new biomarkers or treatment exploring.",2023,,"Humans; MicroRNAs; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Alzheimer Disease; Gene Expression Profiling; Biomarkers","Li, D; Chen, Y; Zhang, T; Lv, Z; Zhang, L; Li, X; Zhang, A"
Focused Ultrasound-mediated Liquid Biopsy in a Tauopathy Mouse Model.,"Background Neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer disease) characterized by the deposition of various pathogenic forms of tau protein in the brain are collectively referred to as tauopathies. Identification of the molecular drivers and pathways of neurodegeneration is critical to individualized targeted treatment of these disorders. However, despite important advances in fluid biomarker detection, characterization of these molecular subtypes is limited by the blood-brain barrier. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and safety of focused ultrasound-mediated liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) in the detection of brain-derived protein biomarkers in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy (PS19 mice). Materials and Methods Sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating the cerebral hemisphere in 2-month-old PS19 and wild-type mice, followed by measurement of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (30 minutes after sonication in the sonobiopsy group). Next, spatially targeted sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating either the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus in 6-month-old PS19 mice. To detect changes in plasma neurofilament light chain (a biomarker of neurodegeneration) levels, blood samples were collected before and after sonication (15 and 45-60 minutes after sonication). Histologic staining was performed to evaluate tissue damage after sonobiopsy.

Net benefit of diagnostic tests for multistate diseases: an indicator variables approach.,"A limitation of the common measures of diagnostic test performance, such as sensitivity and specificity, is that they do not consider the relative importance of false negative and false positive test results, which are likely to have different clinical consequences. Therefore, the use of classification or prediction measures alone to compare diagnostic tests or biomarkers can be inconclusive for clinicians. Comparing tests on net benefit can be more conclusive because clinical consequences of misdiagnoses are considered. The literature suggested evaluating the binary diagnostic tests based on net benefit, but did not consider diagnostic tests that classify more than two disease states, e.g., stroke subtype (large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small-vessel occlusion, stroke of other determined etiology, stroke of undetermined etiology), skin lesion subtype, breast cancer subtypes (benign, mass, calcification, architectural distortion, etc.), METAVIR liver fibrosis state (F0- F4), histopathological classification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), prostate Gleason grade, brain injury (intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, cranial fracture) . Other diseases have more than two stages, such as Alzheimer's disease (dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive disability (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease, and preclinical presymptomatics due to Alzheimer's disease). In diseases with more than two states, the benefits and risks may vary between states. This paper extends the net-benefit approach of evaluating binary diagnostic tests to multi-state clinical conditions to rule-in or rule-out a clinical condition based on adverse consequences of work-up delay (due to false negative test result) and unnecessary workup (due to false positive test result). We demonstrate our approach with numerical examples and real data.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; benefit-risk; clinical utility; decision theory; diagnostic yield table; loss function; relative net-benefit,"Male; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stroke; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Neuropsychological Tests","Samawi, H; Ahmed, F; Pennello, G; Yin, J"

EEG biomarkers of activation of the lymphatic drainage system of the brain during sleep and opening of the blood-brain barrier.,"The lymphatic drainage system of the brain (LDSB) is the removal of metabolites and wastes from its tissues. A dysfunction of LDSB is an important sign of aging, brain oncology, the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The development of new strategies for diagnosis of LDSB injuries can improve prevention of age-related cerebral amyloid angiopathy, neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. There are two conditions, such as deep sleep and opening of the blood-brain-barrier (OBBB) associated with the LDSB activation. A promising candidate for measurement of LDSB could be electroencephalography (EEG). In this pilot study on rats, we tested the hypothesis, whether deep sleep and OBBB can be an informative platform for an effective extracting of information about the LDSB functions. Using the nonlinear analysis of EEG dynamics and machine learning technology, we discovered that the LDSB activation during OBBB and sleep is associated with similar changes in the EEG θ-activity. The OBBB causes the higher LDSB activation vs. sleep that is accompanied by specific changes in the low frequency EEG activity extracted by the power spectra analysis of the EEG dynamics combined with the coherence function. Thus, our findings demonstrate a link between neural activity associated with the LDSB activation during sleep and OBBB that is an important informative platform for extraction of the EEG-biomarkers of the LDSB activity. These results open new perspectives for the development of technology for the LDSB diagnostics that would open a novel era in the prognosis of brain diseases caused by the LDSB disorders, including OBBB.",2023,Electroencephalography; Lymphatic drainage system of the brain; Machine learning methods; Non-linear analysis; Opening of the blood-brain barrier; Sleep,,"Semyachkina-Glushkovskaya, OV; Karavaev, AS; Prokhorov, MD; Runnova, AE; Borovkova, EI; Yu M, I; Hramkov, AN; Kulminskiy, DD; Semenova, NI; Sergeev, KS; Slepnev, AV; Yu, SE; Zhuravlev, MO; Fedosov, IV; Shirokov, AA; Blokhina, IA; Dubrovski, AI; Terskov, AV; Khorovodov, AP; Ageev, VB; Elovenko, DA; Evsukova, AS; Adushkina, VV; Telnova, VV; Postnov, DE; Penzel, TU; Kurths, JG"

Blood-brain barrier opening of the default mode network in Alzheimer's disease with magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain but is also an important obstacle for the effective delivery of therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been shown to reversibly disrupt the BBB. However, treatment of diffuse regions across the brain along with the effect on Alzheimer's disease relevant pathology need to be better characterized. This study is an open-labelled single-arm trial (NCT04118764) to investigate the feasibility of modulating BBB permeability in the default mode network and the impact on cognition, amyloid and tau pathology as well as BBB integrity. Nine participants [mean age 70.2 ± 7.2 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 21.9] underwent three biweekly procedures with follow-up visits up to 6 months. The BBB permeability of the bilateral hippocampi, anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus was transiently increased without grade 3 or higher adverse events. Participants did not experience worsening trajectory of cognitive decline (ADAS-cog11, MMSE). Whole brain vertex-based analysis of the 18F-florbetaben PET imaging demonstrated clusters of modest SUVR reduction in the right parahippocampal and inferior temporal lobe. However, CSF and blood biomarkers did not demonstrate any amelioration of Alzheimer's disease pathology (P-tau181, amyloid-β42/40 ratio), nor did it show persistent BBB dysfunction (plasma PDGFRbeta and CSF-to-plasma albumin ratio).

Brain microdialysate tau dynamics predict functional and neurocognitive recovery after poor-grade subarachnoid haemorrhage.,"Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a devastating disease that results in neurocognitive deficits and a poor functional outcome in a considerable proportion of patients. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of microtubule-associated tau protein measured in the cerebral microdialysate for long-term functional and neuropsychological outcomes in poor-grade subarachnoid haemorrhage patients. We recruited 55 consecutive non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage patients who underwent multimodal neuromonitoring, including cerebral microdialysis. Mitochondrial dysfunction was defined as lactate-to-pyruvate ratio >30 together with pyruvate >70 mmol/L and metabolic distress as lactate-to-pyruvate ratio >40. The multidimensional 12-month outcome was assessed by means of the modified Rankin scale (poor outcome: modified Rankin scale ≥4) and a standardized neuropsychological test battery. We used multivariable generalized estimating equation models to assess associations between total microdialysate-tau levels of the first 10 days after admission and hospital complications and outcomes. Patients were 56 ± 12 years old and presented with a median Hunt & Hess score of 5 (interquartile range: 3-5). Overall mean total microdialysate-tau concentrations were highest within the first 24 h (5585 ± 6291 pg/mL), decreased to a minimum of 2347 ± 4175 pg/mL on Day 4 (",2023,brain total tau; cerebral microdialysis; functional outcome; neurocognitive outcome; subarachnoid haemorrhage,,"Heilig, M; Rass, V; Lindner, A; Kofler, M; Ianosi, BA; Gaasch, M; Putnina, L; Humpel, C; Scherfler, C; Zamarian, L; Bodner, T; Djamshidian, A; Schiefecker, A; Thomé, C; Beer, R; Pfausler, B; Helbok, R"
Identification of Plasma Proteomic Biomarkers in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Plasma proteomic profiling may provide novel biomarkers for the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The early diagnosis of MCI still remains a challenging task due to its diverse origin. Currently, molecular approaches have been used to identify MCI diversified origin as its onset is governed by a variety of molecular changes. Therefore, we aimed to find out molecular alteration in plasma using proteomics in patients with MCI for early detection of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). To achieve this, we performed two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF/MS, which is used to analyze the differentially expressed proteins. In our study, we found three significantly altered proteins. Out of three differentially expressed proteins, one was downregulated and two were upregulated in MCI individuals as compared to control. Further, In silico analysis showed that identified proteins are involved in pathways such as complement and coagulation cascades, platelet activation and AD. STRING interaction network analysis revealed that the majority of proteins including apolipoprotein E (APO-E) have a common association with Transthyretin (TTR) and fibrinogen chain beta (FGB) protein. This suggests that APO-E, TTR and FGB are the key proteins with which other proteins interact to exert other biological functions. Conclusively, these proteins showing differential expression in the plasma might be used as a potent signature in blood for the diagnosis of MCI individuals.",2023,2D-gel electrophoresis; Biomarker; Diffusion tensor imaging; Mild cognitive impairment; Proteomics,,"Singh, V; Mishra, VN; Thakur, MK"
Whole blood transcript and protein abundance of the vascular endothelial growth factor family relate to cognitive performance.,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of genes has been implicated in the clinical development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A previous study identified associations between gene expression of VEGF family members in the prefrontal cortex and cognitive performance and AD pathology. This study explored if those associations were also observed in the blood. Consistent with previous observations in brain tissue, higher blood gene expression of placental growth factor (PGF) was associated with a faster rate of memory decline (p=0.04). Higher protein abundance of FMS-related receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4) in blood was associated with biomarker levels indicative of lower amyloid and tau pathology, opposite the direction observed in brain. Also, higher gene expression of VEGFB in blood was associated with better baseline memory (p=0.008). Notably, we observed that higher gene expression of VEGFB in blood was associated with lower expression of VEGFB in the brain (r=-0.19, p=0.02). Together, these results suggest that the VEGFB, FLT4, and PGF alterations in the AD brain may be detectable in the blood compartment.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Blood biomarkers; Mild Cognitive Impairment; VEGF,Humans; Female; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Placenta Growth Factor; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Libby, JB; Seto, M; Khan, OA; Liu, D; Petyuk, V; Oliver, NC; Choi, MJ; Whitaker, M; Patterson, KL; Arul, AB; Gifford, KA; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Dumitrescu, L; Robinson, RA; Jefferson, AL; Hohman, TJ"
Mendelian Randomisation Confirms the Role of Y-Chromosome Loss in Alzheimer's Disease Aetiopathogenesis in Men.,"Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) is a common ageing-related somatic event and has been previously associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, mLOY estimation from genotype microarray data only reflects the mLOY degree of subjects at the moment of DNA sampling. Therefore, mLOY phenotype associations with AD can be severely age-confounded in the context of genome-wide association studies. Here, we applied Mendelian randomisation to construct an age-independent mLOY polygenic risk score (mloy-PRS) using 114 autosomal variants. The mloy-PRS instrument was associated with an 80% increase in mLOY risk per standard deviation unit (",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF biomarkers; EADB; GR@ACE/DEGESCO; GWAS; Mendelian randomization; disease progression; mild cognitive impairment; mosaic loss of chromosome Y; polygenic risk score,"Humans; Male; Female; Alzheimer Disease; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mosaicism; Risk Factors; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","García-González, P; de Rojas, I; Moreno-Grau, S; Montrreal, L; Puerta, R; Alarcón-Martín, E; Quintela, I; Orellana, A; Andrade, V; Adami, PVM; Heilmann-Heimbach, S; Gomez-Garre, P; Periñán, MT; Alvarez, I; Diez-Fairen, M; Nuñez Llaves, R; Olivé Roig, C; Garcia-Ribas, G; Menéndez-González, M; Martínez, C; Aguilar, M; Buongiorno, M; Franco-Macías, E; Saez, ME; Cano, A; Bullido, MJ; Real, LM; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, E; Royo, JL; Álvarez, V; Pastor, P; Piñol-Ripoll, G; Mir, P; Lara, MC; Padilla, MM; Sánchez-Juan, P; Carracedo, A; Valero, S; Hernandez, I; Tàrraga, L; Ramirez, A; Boada, M; Ruiz, A"

Anti-amyloid antibody therapies in Alzheimer's disease.,"After years of failed attempts to develop a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease, consistent evidence in support of clinical efficacy was finally presented for a monoclonal antibody targeting the amyloid-β protofibrils. In addition to meeting the primary outcome of slowing clinical disease progression over 18 months, secondary clinical outcomes and amyloid-β lowering on PET also underpin the positive results of the trial. In this opinion piece, we highlight the key characteristics of the previous unsuccessful trials and analyse the potential reasons why those attempts to develop a treatment for early Alzheimer's disease failed. We compare the safety profiles of the different antibodies and highlight cautionary measures for their routine clinical use. Last, we discuss the role of blood-based biomarkers in transforming the clinical care pathway to facilitate the uptake of antibody treatments, proposing an integrated case-finding and treatment model crossing the different healthcare sectors. Taken together, a real breakthrough may have been achieved by proving that amyloid-β reduction results in clinical benefits, rather than just biomarker changes. At the same time, routine use of the new generation of drugs will show if statistical efficacy translates into clinically meaningful change. This may just be the beginning of a new era of Alzheimer's disease drug development.",2023,anti-amyloid immunization; disease progression; fluid and imaging biomarkers; mild cognitive impairment and dementia; monoclonal antibodies; treatment of cognitive decline,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid; Treatment Outcome; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression","Perneczky, R; Jessen, F; Grimmer, T; Levin, J; Flöel, A; Peters, O; Froelich, L"
A two-gene marker for the two-tiered innate immune response in COVID-19 patients.,"For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic disease characterized by strong immune dysregulation in severe patients, convenient and efficient monitoring of the host immune response is critical. Human hosts respond to viral and bacterial infections in different ways, the former is characterized by the activation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) such as IFI27, while the latter is characterized by the activation of anti-bacterial associated genes (ABGs) such as S100A12. This two-tiered innate immune response has not been examined in COVID-19. In this study, the activation patterns of this two-tiered innate immune response represented by IFI27 and S100A12 were explored based on 1421 samples from 17 transcriptome datasets derived from the blood of COVID-19 patients and relevant controls. It was found that IFI27 activation occurred in most of the symptomatic patients and displayed no correlation with disease severity, while S100A12 activation was more restricted to patients under severe and critical conditions with a stepwise activation pattern. In addition, most of the S100A12 activation was accompanied by IFI27 activation. Furthermore, the activation of IFI27 was most pronounced within the first week of symptom onset, but generally waned after 2-3 weeks. On the other hand, the activation of S100A12 displayed no apparent correlation with disease duration and could last for several months in certain patients. These features of the two-tiered innate immune response can further our understanding on the disease mechanism of COVID-19 and may have implications to the clinical triage. Development of a convenient two-gene protocol for the routine serial monitoring of this two-tiered immune response will be a valuable addition to the existing laboratory tests.",2023,,"Humans; COVID-19; Genetic Markers; Immunity, Innate; Interferons; S100A12 Protein","Lei, H"

Fluid biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterization has progressed from being indexed using clinical symptomatology followed by neuropathological examination at autopsy to in vivo signatures using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and positron emission tomography. The core AD biomarkers reflect amyloid-β plaques (A), tau pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N), following the ATN schedule, and are now being introduced into clinical routine practice. This is an important development, as disease-modifying treatments are now emerging. Further, there are now reproducible data on CSF biomarkers which reflect synaptic pathology, neuroinflammation and common co-pathologies. In addition, the development of ultrasensitive techniques has enabled the core CSF biomarkers of AD pathophysiology to be translated to blood (e.g., phosphorylated tau, amyloid-β and neurofilament light). In this chapter, we review where we stand with both core and novel CSF biomarkers, as well as the explosion of data on blood biomarkers. Also, we discuss potential applications in research aiming to better understand the disease, as well as possible use in routine clinical practice and therapeutic trials.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid; Biomarkers; Cerebrospinal fluid; Imaging; Neurodegeneration; Neurofilament; Neuropathology; Tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Simrén, J; Elmgren, A; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H"

Identification and validation of oxidative stress and immune-related hub genes in Alzheimer's disease through bioinformatics analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in aged population. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Investigation of hub genes for the development of potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers is warranted. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD were screened in GSE48350 dataset. The differentially expressed oxidative stress genes (DEOSGs) were analyzed by intersection of DEGs and oxidative stress-related genes. The immune-related DEOSGs and hub genes were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, respectively. Enrichment analysis was performed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The diagnostic value of hub genes was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis and validated in GSE1297. The mRNA expression of diagnostic genes was determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Finally, we constructed the drug, transcription factors (TFs), and microRNA network of the diagnostic genes. A total of 1160 DEGs (259 up-regulated and 901 down-regulated) were screened in GSE48350. Among them 111 DEOSGs were identified in AD. Thereafter, we identified significant difference of infiltrated immune cells (effector memory CD8 T cell, activated B cell, memory B cell, natural killer cell, CD56 bright natural killer cell, natural killer T cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, and neutrophil) between AD and control samples. 27 gene modules were obtained through WGCNA and turquoise module was the most relevant module. We obtained 66 immune-related DEOSGs by intersecting turquoise module with the DEOSGs and identified 15 hub genes through PPI analysis. Among them, 9 hub genes (CCK, CNR1, GAD1, GAP43, NEFL, NPY, PENK, SST, and TAC1) were identified with good diagnostic values and verified in GSE1297. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the downregulation of SST, NPY, GAP43, CCK, and PENK and upregulation of NEFL in AD. Finally, we identified 76 therapeutic agents, 152 miRNAs targets, and 91 TFs regulatory networks. Our study identified 9 key genes associated with oxidative stress and immune reaction in AD pathogenesis. The findings may help to provide promising candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; B-Lymphocytes; Computational Biology; Dendritic Cells; Gene Regulatory Networks; MicroRNAs; Oxidative Stress,"Li, S; Xiao, J; Huang, C; Sun, J"
Experimental approaches for altering the expression of Abeta-degrading enzymes.,"Cerebral clearance of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is decreased in early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is cleared from the brain by enzymatic degradation and by transport out of the brain. More than 20 Aβ-degrading enzymes have been described. Increasing the degradation of Aβ offers an opportunity to decrease brain Aβ levels in AD patients. This review discusses the direct and indirect approaches which have been used in experimental systems to alter the expression and/or activity of Aβ-degrading enzymes. Also discussed are the enzymes' regulatory mechanisms, the conformations of Aβ they degrade, where in the scheme of Aβ production, extracellular release, cellular uptake, and intracellular degradation they exert their activities, and changes in their expression and/or activity in AD and its animal models. Most of the experimental approaches require further confirmation. Based upon each enzyme's effects on Aβ (some of the enzymes also possess β-secretase activity and may therefore promote Aβ production), its direction of change in AD and/or its animal models, and the Aβ conformation(s) it degrades, investigating the effects of increasing the expression of neprilysin in AD patients would be of particular interest. Increasing the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme, endothelin-converting enzyme-1, endothelin-converting enzyme-2, tissue plasminogen activator, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and presequence peptidase would also be of interest. Increasing matrix metalloproteinase-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9, cathepsin-B, and cathepsin-D expression would be problematic because of possible damage by the metalloproteinases to the blood brain barrier and the cathepsins' β-secretase activity. Many interventions which increase the enzymatic degradation of Aβ have been shown to decrease AD-type pathology in experimental models. If a safe approach can be found to increase the expression or activity of selected Aβ-degrading enzymes in human subjects, then the possibility that this approach could slow the AD progression should be examined in clinical trials.",2023,Abeta; Alzheimer's; degradation; enzymes; experimental approaches,Animals; Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Endothelin-Converting Enzymes; Alzheimer Disease; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Neprilysin; Cathepsins,"Loeffler, DA"

PD-1/PD-L1 pathway: A double-edged sword in periodontitis.,"Periodontitis is a disease caused by infection and immunological imbalance, which often leads to the destruction of periodontal tissue. Programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand: programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are important ""immune checkpoint"" proteins that have a negative regulatory effect on T cells and are targets of immunotherapy. Studies have shown that the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in patients with periodontitis is higher than that in healthy individuals. The keystone pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is believed to be the main factor driving the upregulation of PD-1/PD-L1. High expression of PD-1/PD-L1 can inhibit the inflammatory response and reduce the destruction of periodontal supporting tissues, but conversely, it can promote the ""immune escape"" of P. gingivalis, thus magnifying infections. In addition, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is also associated with various diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we discuss the influence and mechanism of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway as a ""double-edged sword"" affecting the occurrence and development of periodontitis, as well as its function in periodontitis-related systemic disorders. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could be a new avenue for periodontal and its related systemic disorders therapy.",2023,Immune checkpoint; Immune escape; P. gingivalis; PD-1; PD-L1; Periodontitis,Humans; B7-H1 Antigen; Ligands; Periodontitis; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; T-Lymphocytes,"Liu, X; Yang, L; Tan, X"
Impact of pre-analytical sample handling factors on plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"An unmet need exists for reliable plasma biomarkers of amyloid pathology, in the clinical laboratory setting, to streamline diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Alzheimer's Disease Is a Multi-Organ Disorder: It May Already Be Preventable.,"In this commentary, we offer an overview of the several environmental and metabolic factors that have been identified as contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many of these factors involve extracranial organ systems including immune system dysfunction accompanied by neuroinflammation (inflammaging), gastrointestinal dysbiosis, insulin resistance, and hepatic dysfunction. A variety of microbial factors including mouth flora, viruses, and fungi appear to play a significant role. There is a role for the colonic microbiome becoming dysbiotic and producing toxic metabolites. Declining hepatic function contributes diminished neuronal precursors and reduces toxin elimination. Environmental toxins especially metals play an important role in impairing the blood-brain barrier and acting synergistically with biotoxins and other toxic chemicals. Prevention and treatment of AD appears to require measuring several of these biomarkers and implementing corrective actions regarding such toxicants and correcting metabolic dysfunction at early or preclinical stages of this disorder.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biotoxins; dementia; dysbiosis; environmental exposure; metabolism; neuroinflammation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Gastrointestinal Tract; Microbiota,"Eiser, AR; Fulop, T"

Biomarkers of Activity-Dependent Plasticity and Persistent Enhancement of Synaptic Transmission in Alzheimer Disease: A Review of the Current Status.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex pathological processes involving neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and synaptic dysfunction. Understanding the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD pathology may help to provide a biomarker for early diagnosis or at least for assessment of vulnerability to dementia development. Neural plasticity is defined as a capability of the brain to respond to alterations including aging, injury, or learning, with a crucial role of synaptic elements. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are important in regulating synaptic connections between neural cells in functional plasticity. Synaptic loss and impairment of the brain's plasticity in AD leads to cognitive impairment, and one of important roles of synaptic biomarkers is monitoring synaptic dysfunction, response to treatment, and predicting future development of AD. Synaptic biomarkers are undoubtedly very promising in developing novel approach to AD treatment and control, especially in the era of aging of societies, which is one of the most common risk factor of AD. Implementing a widespread measurement of synaptic biomarkers of AD will probably be crucial in early diagnosis of AD, early therapeutic intervention, monitoring progression of the disease, or response to treatment. One of the most important challenges is finding a biomarker whose blood concentration correlates with its level in the central nervous system (CNS).

Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease with Blood Test; Tempting but Challenging.,"The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a health crisis. According to official statistics, more than 55 million people globally have AD or other types of dementia, making it the sixth leading cause of death. It is still difficult to diagnose AD and there is no definitive diagnosis yet; post-mortem autopsy is still the only definite method. Moreover, clinical manifestations occur very late in the course of disease progression; therefore, profound irreversible changes have already occurred when the disease manifests. Studies have shown that in the preclinical stage of AD, changes in some biomarkers are measurable prior to any neurological damage or other symptoms. Hence, creating a reliable, fast, and affordable method capable of detecting AD in early stage has attracted the most attention. Seeking clinically applicable, inexpensive, less invasive, and much more easily accessible biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD, blood-based biomarkers (BBBs) seem to be an ideal option. This review is an inclusive report of BBBs that have been shown to be altered in the course of AD progression. The aim of this report is to provide comprehensive insight into the research status of early detection of AD based on BBBs.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood-based biomarker; early diagnosis; multiplexing,,"Farvadi, F; Hashemi, F; Amini, A; Alsadat Vakilinezhad, M; Raee, MJ"

Brain-derived tau: a novel blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration.,"Blood-based biomarkers for amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau show good diagnostic accuracies and agreements with their corresponding CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration [A/T/(N)] framework for Alzheimer's disease. However, the blood-based neurodegeneration marker neurofilament light is not specific to Alzheimer's disease while total-tau shows lack of correlation with CSF total-tau. Recent studies suggest that blood total-tau originates principally from peripheral, non-brain sources. We sought to address this challenge by generating an anti-tau antibody that selectively binds brain-derived tau and avoids the peripherally expressed 'big tau' isoform. We applied this antibody to develop an ultrasensitive blood-based assay for brain-derived tau, and validated it in five independent cohorts (n = 609) including a blood-to-autopsy cohort, CSF biomarker-classified cohorts and memory clinic cohorts. In paired samples, serum and CSF brain-derived tau were significantly correlated (rho = 0.85, P < 0.0001), while serum and CSF total-tau were not (rho = 0.23, P = 0.3364). Blood-based brain-derived tau showed equivalent diagnostic performance as CSF total-tau and CSF brain-derived tau to separate biomarker-positive Alzheimer's disease participants from biomarker-negative controls. Furthermore, plasma brain-derived tau accurately distinguished autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative diseases (area under the curve = 86.4%) while neurofilament light did not (area under the curve = 54.3%). These performances were independent of the presence of concomitant pathologies. Plasma brain-derived tau (rho = 0.52-0.67, P = 0.003), but not neurofilament light (rho = -0.14-0.17, P = 0.501), was associated with global and regional amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts. These results were further verified in two memory clinic cohorts where serum brain-derived tau differentiated Alzheimer's disease from a range of other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and atypical parkinsonian disorders (area under the curve up to 99.6%). Notably, plasma/serum brain-derived tau correlated with neurofilament light only in Alzheimer's disease but not in the other neurodegenerative diseases. Across cohorts, plasma/serum brain-derived tau was associated with CSF and plasma AT(N) biomarkers and cognitive function. Brain-derived tau is a new blood-based biomarker that outperforms plasma total-tau and, unlike neurofilament light, shows specificity to Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration. Thus, brain-derived tau demonstrates potential to complete the AT(N) scheme in blood, and will be useful to evaluate Alzheimer's disease-dependent neurodegenerative processes for clinical and research purposes.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; neurodegenerative disease; neurofilament light; plasma brain-derived-tau; total-tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Brain; Biomarkers,"Gonzalez-Ortiz, F; Turton, M; Kac, PR; Smirnov, D; Premi, E; Ghidoni, R; Benussi, L; Cantoni, V; Saraceno, C; Rivolta, J; Ashton, NJ; Borroni, B; Galasko, D; Harrison, P; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Karikari, TK"

MRI assessment of cerebral oxygen extraction fraction in the medial temporal lobe.,"The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a key area implicated in many brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.

However, there is a lack of non-invasive techniques to measure MTL-OEF in humans. The goal of this work is to develop an MRI technique to assess MTL-OEF in a clinically practical time without using contrast agents.

"Role of Tau in Various Tauopathies, Treatment Approaches, and Emerging Role of Nanotechnology in Neurodegenerative Disorders.","A few protein kinases and phosphatases regulate tau protein phosphorylation and an imbalance in their enzyme activity results in tau hyper-phosphorylation. Aberrant tau phosphorylation causes tau to dissociate from the microtubules and clump together in the cytosol to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which lead to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Hence, targeting hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a restorative approach for treating neurodegenerative tauopathies. The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk5) and the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) have both been implicated in aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation. The limited transport of drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for reaching the central nervous system (CNS) thus represents a significant problem in the development of drugs. Drug delivery systems based on nanocarriers help solve this problem. In this review, we discuss the tau protein, regulation of tau phosphorylation and abnormal hyperphosphorylation, drugs in use or under clinical trials, and treatment strategies for tauopathies based on the critical role of tau hyperphosphorylation in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Plasma Core Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Predict Amyloid Deposition Burden by Positron Emission Tomography in Chinese Individuals with Cognitive Decline.,"Blood-based biomarkers have been considered as a promising method for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In this study, we investigated the capability of plasma core AD biomarkers in predicting cerebral Aβ deposition burden among the China Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorder Initiative (CANDI) cohort consisting of cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia, and non-Alzheimer's dementia disease (Non-ADD).

Proteomic clusters underlie heterogeneity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease progression.,"Heterogeneity in progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses challenges for both clinical prognosis and clinical trial implementation. Multiple AD-related subtypes have previously been identified, suggesting differences in receptivity to drug interventions. We identified early differences in preclinical AD biomarkers, assessed patterns for developing preclinical AD across the amyloid-tau-(neurodegeneration) [AT(N)] framework, and considered potential sources of difference by analysing the CSF proteome. Participants (n = 10) enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center completed four or more lumbar punctures. These individuals were cognitively normal at baseline. Cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid-β (Aβ)42, phosphorylated tau (pTau181), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) as well as proteomics values were evaluated. Imaging biomarkers, including PET amyloid and tau, and structural MRI, were repeatedly obtained when available. Individuals were staged according to the amyloid-tau-(neurodegeneration) framework. Growth mixture modelling, an unsupervised clustering technique, identified three patterns of biomarker progression as measured by CSF pTau181 and Aβ42. Two groups (AD Biomarker Positive and Intermediate AD Biomarker) showed distinct progression from normal biomarker status to having biomarkers consistent with preclinical AD. A third group (AD Biomarker Negative) did not develop abnormal AD biomarkers over time. Participants grouped by CSF trajectories were re-classified using only proteomic profiles (AUCAD Biomarker Positive versus AD Biomarker Negative = 0.857, AUCAD Biomarker Positive versus Intermediate AD Biomarkers = 0.525, AUCIntermediate AD Biomarkers versus AD Biomarker Negative = 0.952). We highlight heterogeneity in the development of AD biomarkers in cognitively normal individuals. We identified some individuals who became amyloid positive before the age of 50 years. A second group, Intermediate AD Biomarkers, developed elevated CSF ptau181 significantly before becoming amyloid positive. A third group were AD Biomarker Negative over repeated testing. Our results could influence the selection of participants for specific treatments (e.g. amyloid-reducing versus other agents) in clinical trials.

Vascular contributions to Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Understanding the pathophysiology underlying AD is paramount for the management of individuals at risk of and suffering from AD. The vascular hypothesis stipulates a relationship between cardiovascular disease and AD-related changes although the nature of this relationship remains unknown. In this review, we discuss several potential pathological pathways of vascular involvement in AD that have been described including dysregulation of neurovascular coupling, disruption of the blood brain barrier, and reduced clearance of metabolite waste such as beta-amyloid, a toxic peptide considered the hallmark of AD. We will also discuss the two-hit hypothesis which proposes a 2-step positive feedback loop in which microvascular insults precede the accumulation of Aß and are thought to be at the origin of the disease development. At neuroimaging, signs of vascular dysfunction such as chronic cerebral hypoperfusion have been demonstrated, appearing early in AD, even before cognitive decline and alteration of traditional biomarkers. Cerebral small vessel disease such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, characterized by the aggregation of Aß in the vessel wall, is highly prevalent in vascular dementia and AD patients. Current data is unclear whether cardiovascular disease causes, precipitates, amplifies, precedes, or simply coincides with AD. Targeted imaging tools to quantitatively evaluate the intracranial vasculature and longitudinal studies in individuals at risk for or in the early stages of the AD continuum could be critical in disentangling this complex relationship between vascular disease and AD.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Eisenmenger, LB; Peret, A; Famakin, BM; Spahic, A; Roberts, GS; Bockholt, JH; Johnson, KM; Paulsen, JS"
Cerebrospinal fluid kappa free light chains for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: A consensus statement.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is of utmost importance for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis (MS). Evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis proves the inflammatory nature of the disease, increases diagnostic certainty and substitutes for dissemination in time according to current diagnostic criteria. The gold standard to determine intrathecal IgG synthesis is the detection of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands (OCBs). However, advances in laboratory methods brought up κ-free light chains (FLCs) as a new biomarker, which are produced in excess over intact immunoglobulins and accumulate in CSF in the case of central nervous system-derived inflammation. Overwhelming evidence showed a high diagnostic accuracy of intrathecal κ-FLC synthesis in MS with sensitivity and specificity of approximately 90% similar to OCB. κ-FLCs have advantages as its detection is fast, easy, cost-effective, reliable, rater-independent and returning quantitative results which might also improve the value of predicting MS disease activity. An international panel of experts in MS and CSF diagnostics developed a consensus of all participants. Six recommendations are given for establishing standard CSF evaluation in patients suspected of having MS. The panel recommended to include intrathecal κ-FLC synthesis in the next revision of MS diagnostic criteria as an additional tool to measure intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.",2023,Cerebrospinal fluid; biomarker; clinically isolated syndrome; consensus; diagnosis; disease activity; index; kappa-free light chains; multiple sclerosis; prediction,Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains; Immunoglobulin G; Biomarkers; Sensitivity and Specificity; Oligoclonal Bands,"Hegen, H; Arrambide, G; Gnanapavan, S; Kaplan, B; Khalil, M; Saadeh, R; Teunissen, C; Tumani, H; Villar, LM; Willrich, MAV; Zetterberg, H; Deisenhammer, F"
Recent diagnostic techniques for the detection of Alzheimer's disease: a short review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that affects millions of individuals around the world and for which there are few effective therapies. Dementia is characterized by the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which is followed by neurotoxicity, which results in memory loss and mortality. Pathogenesis occurs several years before the onset of disease. As the disease-modifying drugs are most effective in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, biomarkers for early detection of disease and their development are crucial.

Boosting of tau protein aggregation by CD40 and CD48 gene expression in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases result from the interplay of abnormal gene expression and various pathological factors. Therefore, a disease-specific integrative genetic approach is required to understand the complexities and causes of target diseases. Recent studies have identified the correlation between genes encoding several transmembrane proteins, such as the cluster of differentiation (CD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In this study, CD48 and CD40 gene expression in AD, a neurodegenerative disease, was analyzed to infer this link. Total RNA sequencing was performed using an Alzheimer's disease mouse model brain and blood, and gene expression was determined using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We observed a marked elevation of CD48 and CD40 genes in Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, the upregulation of both CD48 and CD40 genes was significantly increased in the severe Alzheimer's disease group. With the elevation of CD48 and CD40 genes in Alzheimer's disease, associations of protein levels were also markedly increased in tissues. In addition, overexpression of CD48 and CD40 genes triggered tau aggregation, and co-expression of these genes accelerated aggregation. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB) signaling pathway was enriched by CD48 and CD40 gene expression: it was also associated with tau pathology. Our data suggested that the CD48 and CD40 genes are novel AD-related genes, and this approach may be useful as a diagnostic or therapeutic target for the disease.",2023,CD40; CD48; Alzheimer's disease; GWAS; biomarker; tau,Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; CD40 Antigens; CD48 Antigen; Gene Expression; Genome-Wide Association Study; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Protein Aggregates; tau Proteins,"Kim, SH; Lim, KH; Yang, S; Joo, JY"

TNFR-1 and GDF-15 Are Associated With Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain and Progranulin Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Secondary Analysis of the MAPT Study.,"There is growing evidence that cognitive decline can be affected by both nutritional aspects and inflammation.

This study aimed to investigate the associations between biomarkers of neurodegeneration, nutrition, and inflammation among community-dwelling older adults, and to verify if associations differed according to apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. This cross-sectional analysis included 475 participants ≥70 years old from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT), mean age 76.8 years (SD = 4.5), 59.4% women. Biomarkers of neurodegeneration (plasma amyloid-β 42/40-Aβ 42/40, neurofilament light chain-NfL, progranulin), nutrition (erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, omega-3 index; plasma homocysteine-Hcy, 25 hydroxyvitamin D), inflammation (plasma tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-TNFR-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-MCP-1, interleukin 6-IL-6), and cellular stress (plasma growth differentiation factor 15-GDF-15) were assessed. Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations between nutritional and inflammatory biomarkers (independent variables) and neurodegenerative biomarkers (dependent variables), with adjustments for age, sex, education, body mass index, physical activity, allocation to MAPT groups, and APOE ε4 status. After adjusting for confounders, Aβ 42/40 was not associated with nutritional or inflammatory markers. NfL was positively associated with GDF-15, TNFR-1, IL-6, and Hcy. Progranulin was positively associated with GDF-15, TNFR-1, and MCP-1. Analyses restricted to APOE ε4 carriers (n = 116; 26.9%) or noncarriers were mostly similar.

Proinflammatory IL-17 levels in serum/cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative diseases: a meta-analysis study.,"IL-17 is one of the major proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathophysiology of various chronic inflammatory diseases. However, a clear association between the levels of IL-17 and various neurodegenerative diseases is inconclusive due to lack of consistent results reported in several studies. Therefore, we designed and performed a meta-analysis study to assess the levels of IL-17 cytokine in various neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this meta-analysis study was to assess the level of IL-17 in cerebrospinal fluid/serum of the patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. An extensive search was performed on electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to find out the relevant studies for analysis. The quality of selected studies was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort and case control studies. The standardized mean difference of level of IL-17 in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and control was calculated using RevMan 5 software. A significant increase in the level of serum IL-17 was found to in the patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (p = 0.001) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (p = 0.009), whereas IL-17 level in serum of Parkinson's disease (p = 0.22), multiple sclerosis (p = 0.09), and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS patients (p = 0.34) was not found to be significant.

Cerebrospinal fluid glucose is not altered in patients with dementia.,"Studies have shown that the pathological changes of many dementia disorders begin several years before clinical onset. A connection between some of these pathophysiological changes and brain hypometabolism, seen in dementia disorders, is well established. Glucose is transported from the blood into the interstitial space, and the decreased demand for glucose by the degenerating brain tissue may thereby mirror increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose.

Altered cerebral blood flow in older adults with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is projected to reach 13 million in the U.S. by 2050. Although major efforts have been made to avoid this outcome, so far there are no treatments that can stop or reverse the progressive cognitive decline that defines Alzheimer's disease. The utilization of preventative treatment before significant cognitive decline has occurred may ultimately be the solution, necessitating a reliable biomarker of preclinical/prodromal disease stages to determine which older adults are most at risk. Quantitative cerebral blood flow is a promising potential early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, but the spatiotemporal patterns of altered cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease are not fully understood. The current systematic review compiles the findings of 81 original studies that compared resting gray matter cerebral blood flow in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and that of cognitively normal older adults and/or assessed the relationship between cerebral blood flow and objective cognitive function. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease had relatively decreased cerebral blood flow in all brain regions investigated, especially the temporoparietal and posterior cingulate, while individuals with mild cognitive impairment had consistent results of decreased cerebral blood flow in the posterior cingulate but more mixed results in other regions, especially the frontal lobe. Most papers reported a positive correlation between regional cerebral blood flow and cognitive function.

"Thiazolidin-4-one prevents against memory deficits, increase in phosphorylated tau protein, oxidative damage and cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer disease model: Comparison with donepezil drug.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized mostly by memory decline. The current therapeutic arsenal for treating AD is limited, and the available drugs only produce symptomatic benefits, but do not stop disease progression. The search for effective therapeutic alternatives with multitarget actions is therefore imperative. One such a potential alternative is thiazolidin-4-one, a compound that exhibits anti-amnesic, anticholinesterase, and antioxidant activities. The aim of this study was evaluated the effects of 2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)- 3-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl) thiazolidin-4-one (DS12) on memory and neurochemical parameters in a model of AD induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Adult male rats were divided into five groups: I, control (saline); II, DS12 (10 mg/kg); III, STZ; IV, STZ + DS12 (10 mg/kg); V, STZ + donepezil (5 mg/kg). The rats were orally treated with DS12 and donepezil for a period of 20 days. Memory, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, phosphorylated tau protein levels and oxidative stress were analyzed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Biochemical and hematological parameters were evaluated in the blood and serum. Memory impairment and the increase in AChE activity and phosphorylated tau protein level induced by STZ were prevented by DS12 and donepezil treatment. Streptozotocin induces an increase in reactive oxygen species levels and a decrease in catalase activity in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. DS12 treatment conferred protection from oxidative alterations in all brain structures. No changes were observed in serum biochemical parameters (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid, and urea) or hematological parameters, such as platelets, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total plasma protein. DS12 improved memory and neurochemical changes in an AD model and did not show toxic effects, suggesting the promising therapeutic potential of this compound.",2023,Acetylcholinesterase; Alzheimer’s disease; Brain; Oxidative stress; Tau protein; Thiazolidin-4-ones,"Rats; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Donepezil; tau Proteins; Streptozocin; Acetylcholinesterase; Oxidative Stress; Memory Disorders; Antioxidants; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Disease Models, Animal; Maze Learning","Dos Santos, A; Teixeira, FC; da Silva, DS; Veleda, TA; de Mello, JE; Luduvico, KP; Tavares, RG; Stefanello, FM; Cunico, W; Spanevello, RM"

Gray matter hypoperfusion is a late pathological event in the course of Alzheimer's disease.,"Several studies have shown decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of hypoperfusion in the disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Combining arterial spin labeling MRI, PET, and CSF biomarkers, we investigated the associations between gray matter (GM)-CBF and the key mechanisms in AD including amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology, synaptic and axonal degeneration. Further, we applied a disease progression modeling to characterize the temporal sequence of different AD biomarkers. Lower perfusion was observed in temporo-occipito-parietal cortex in the Aβ-positive cognitively impaired compared to both Aβ-negative and Aβ-positive cognitively unimpaired individuals. In participants along the AD spectrum, GM-CBF was associated with tau, synaptic and axonal dysfunction, but not Aβ in similar cortical regions. Axonal degeneration was further associated with hypoperfusion in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Disease progression modeling revealed that GM-CBF disruption Followed the abnormality of biomarkers of Aβ, tau and brain atrophy. These findings indicate that tau tangles and neurodegeneration are more closely connected with GM-CBF changes than Aβ pathology. Although subjected to the sensitivity of the employed neuroimaging techniques and the modeling approach, these findings suggest that hypoperfusion might not be an early event associated with the build-up of Aβ in preclinical phase of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; arterial spin labeling; cerebral blood flow; neurodegeneration; tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gray Matter; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Disease Progression,"Ahmadi, K; Pereira, JB; Berron, D; Vogel, J; Ingala, S; Strandberg, OT; Janelidze, S; Barkhof, F; Pfeuffer, J; Knutsson, L; van Westen, D; Palmqvist, S; Mutsaerts, HJ; Hansson, O"
Modifiable risk factors of dementia linked to excitation-inhibition imbalance.,"Recent evidence identifies 12 potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia to which 40% of dementia cases are attributed. While the recognition of these risk factors has paved the way for the development of new prevention measures, the link between these risk factors and the underlying pathophysiology of dementia is yet not well understood. A growing number of recent clinical and preclinical studies support a role of Excitation-Inhibition (E-I) imbalance in the pathophysiology of dementia. In this review, we aim to propose a conceptual model on the links between the modifiable risk factors and the E-I imbalance in dementia. This model, which aims to address the current gap in the literature, is based on 12 mediating common mechanisms: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cerebral hypo-perfusion, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, beta-amyloid deposition, elevated homocysteine level, impaired neurogenesis, tau tangles, GABAergic dysfunction, and glutamatergic dysfunction.

We also assessed PBMCs isolated from the whole blood of AD patients and a healthy control group, and subsequently analyzed those samples using miRNA super-resolution imaging. We detected more miR-200a-3p expression in the cornu ammonis 1 and dentate gyrus regions of 3 month-old 5XFAD mice than in wild-type mice. Additionally, miRNA super-resolution imaging of blood provides AD diagnosis platform for studying miRNA regulation inside cells at the single molecule level.

Three-Dimensional Imaging of Fibrinogen and Neurovascular Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Cerebrovascular dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is linked to cognitive decline. However, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in AD is focal and requires sensitive methods to detect extravasated blood proteins and vasculature in large brain volumes. Fibrinogen, a blood coagulation factor, is deposited in AD brains at sites of BBB disruption and cerebrovascular damage. This chapter presents the methodology of fibrinogen immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional (3D) imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO) which, when combined with immunolabeling of amyloid β (Aβ) and vasculature, enables sensitive detection of focal BBB vascular abnormalities, and reveals the spatial distribution of Aβ plaques and fibrin deposits, in large tissue volumes from cleared human brains.

"Investigation of Relationship Between Small Noncoding RNA (sncRNA) Expression Levels and Serum Iron, Copper, and Zinc Levels in Clinical Diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis Patients.","In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between microRNA (miRNA) expression levels and serum iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) levels in Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral venous blood containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) of MS patients and controls. Total RNA was labeled with Cy3-CTP fluorescent dye. Hybridization of samples was performed on microarray slides and arrays were scanned. Data argument and bioinformatics analysis were performed. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer method was used to measure serum Fe, Cu, and Zn levels. In our study, in bioinformatics analysis, although differently expressed miRNAs were not detected between 16 MS patients and 16 controls, hsa-miR-744-5p upregulation was detected between 4 MS patients and 4 controls. This may be stem from the patient group consisting of MS patients who have never had an attack for 1 year. Serum iron levels were detected significantly higher in the 16 MS patients compared to the 16 controls. This may be stem from the increase in iron accumulation based on inflammation in MS disease. According to the findings in our study, hsa-miR-744-5p upregulation has been determined as an early diagnostic biomarker for the development together of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus associated with insulin signaling, and Alzheimer's diseases. Therefore, hsa-miR-744-5p is recommended as an important biomarker for the development together of diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and MS disease.

Overview of the blood biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: Promises and challenges.,"The increasing number of people with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant psychological and financial cost to the world population. Accurate detection of the earliest phase of preclinical AD is of major importance for the success of preventive and therapeutic strategies (Cullen et al., 2021).

Blood biomarkers hold promising potential for early and minimally invasive detection of AD, but also for differential diagnosis of dementia and for monitoring the course of the disease. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of current blood biomarkers of AD, from tau proteins and amyloid peptides to biomarkers of neuronal degeneration and inflammation, reactive and metabolic factors.

Therefore, the critical point of early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AD is to monitor the levels of Aβ. In view of the potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for diagnosing and treating the AD, much attention has been focused in recent years.

Blood-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: a mini-review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and has far reaching consequences for patients and their caregivers. Early detection and treatment are key factors in limiting the impact of the disease. However, a definitive diagnosis of AD requires an examination of brain tissue during an autopsy. Although a plethora of biomarkers such as neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are available, their utility is limited to research due to their poor reach and prohibitive cost. In order for biomarkers to be widely used, they need to be accessible, affordable, and conducive for the patient population or disease stage. Blood-based biomarkers may not only be less expensive and more accessible compared to neuroimaging or CSF tests, but they are also preferred by patients with AD as they are much less invasive. In this mini-review article, we expand on the rationale for the use of blood-based biomarkers, review currently available biomarkers and discuss the need for the standardization of these biomarkers. We contrast the blood-based biomarkers with other available biomarkers and discuss the advantages of using a panel of blood-based biomarkers to strengthen their accuracy.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Blood-based biomarkers; CSF; Neuroimaging,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Brain; Early Diagnosis; Neuroimaging; tau Proteins,"Padala, SP; Newhouse, PA"
The induction of ferroptosis in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.,"Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a common neurological disease characterized by the disordered secretion of cerebrospinal fluid from the choroid plexus, ventricular dilation, and increased intracranial pressure after hemorrhage. Although these pathological processes are well established, the effective biomarkers for the diagnosis of PHH are still limited, largely because the underlying mechanisms-including cell death in the choroid plexus-are not well defined. Ferroptosis, a newly recognized type of programmed cell death, has been found to play a key role in a variety of pathologic conditions and diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. However, whether ferroptosis is induced in PHH is still unknown. In the current study, a rat model of PHH was established to investigate the induction of ferroptosis in PHH. Along with defects in memory and cognition, we observed that rats with experimentally induced PHH also demonstrated lipid peroxidation (a key marker of ferroptosis), as well as a significant increase and a significant decrease in two ferroptosis-specific genes, ACSL4 and SLC7A11, respectively. Thus, ferroptosis may serve as an auxiliary indicator for the diagnosis of PHH.",2023,Choroid plexus; Ferroptosis; Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus,Rats; Animals; Ferroptosis; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Hydrocephalus; Choroid Plexus; Biomarkers,"Meng, Z; Liu, C; Chen, C; Di, F; Zhang, S; Liang, X; Li, M"
Serum amyloid A1 and pregnancy zone protein in pregnancy complications and correlation with markers of placental dysfunction.,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension), diabetes mellitus, and placental dysfunction confer an increased risk of long-term maternal cardiovascular disease.

Serum amyloid A1 is involved in hypercoagulability and atherosclerosis and may aggregate into amyloid-aggregations of misfolded proteins. Pregnancy zone protein may inhibit amyloid aggregation.

A Group of Long Non-coding RNAs in Blood Acts as a Specific Biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we evaluated whether lncRNAs can be used to discriminate AD patients from controls and patients with other dementias, such as vascular, Parkinson's disease, behavioral variant frontotemporal, and dementia with Lewy body. In this study, we used three datasets to measure the blood lncRNA levels. A pilot study (dataset 1, n = 40; controls, 20; AD, 20) was used to screen for differentially expressed lncRNAs. Dataset 2 (n = 174; controls, 86; AD, 88) was used to identify a lncRNA panel for the diagnostic model. Dataset 3 (n = 333; control, 60; AD, 54; vascular dementia, 53; Parkinson's disease dementia, 55; behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, 56; and dementia with Lewy body, 55) was used to validate the diagnostic model. In dataset 1, 12 upregulated and 15 downregulated lncRNAs were identified. In dataset 2, a panel of seven lncRNAs was found to have the ability to differentiate AD patients from controls. Finally, this panel was applied to dataset 3 to successfully distinguish AD from other dementias. This study proposes a panel of seven lncRNAs as specific and promising biomarker for AD diagnosis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarker; Dementia; Diagnosis; lncRNA,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; RNA, Long Noncoding; Lewy Body Disease; Pilot Projects; Parkinson Disease; Frontotemporal Dementia; Biomarkers","Ren, Z; Chu, C; Pang, Y; Cai, H; Jia, L"

Blood plasma protein profiles of neuropsychiatric symptoms and related cognitive decline in older people.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) severely affect patients and their caregivers, and are associated with worse long-term outcomes. This study tested the hypothesis that altered protein levels in blood plasma could serve as biomarkers of NPS; and that altered protein levels are associated with persisting NPS and cognitive decline over time. We performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal study in older subjects with cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired in a memory clinic setting. NPS were recorded through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) while cognitive and functional impairment was assessed using the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SoB) score at baseline and follow-up visits. Shotgun proteomic analysis based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted in blood plasma samples, identifying 420 proteins. The presence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology was determined by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Eighty-five subjects with a mean age of 70 (±7.4) years, 62% female and 54% with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia were included. We found 15 plasma proteins with altered baseline levels in participants with NPS (NPI-Q score > 0). Adding those 15 proteins to a reference model based on clinical data (age, CDR-SoB) significantly improved the prediction of NPS (from receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC] 0.75 to AUC 0.91, p = 0.004) with a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 74%. The identified proteins additionally predicted both persisting NPS and cognitive decline at follow-up visits. The observed associations were independent of the presence of AD pathology. Using proteomics, we identified a panel of specific blood proteins associated with current and future NPS, and related cognitive decline in older people. These findings show the potential of untargeted proteomics to identify blood-based biomarkers of pathological alterations relevant for NPS and related clinical disease progression.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia; biomarkers; cognitive decline; neuropsychiatric symptoms; proteomics,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Proteomics; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Blood Proteins; Biomarkers,"Rabl, M; Clark, C; Dayon, L; Bowman, GL; Popp, J"

The effects and potential of microglial polarization and crosstalk with other cells of the central nervous system in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Microglia are resident immune cells in the central nervous system. During the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, stimulatory factors continuously act on the microglia causing abnormal activation and unbalanced phenotypic changes; these events have become a significant and promising area of research. In this review, we summarize the effects of microglial polarization and crosstalk with other cells in the central nervous system in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Our literature search found that phenotypic changes occur continuously in Alzheimer's disease and that microglia exhibit extensive crosstalk with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and penetrated peripheral innate immune cells via specific signaling pathways and cytokines. Collectively, unlike previous efforts to modulate microglial phenotypes at a single level, targeting the phenotypes of microglia and the crosstalk with other cells in the central nervous system may be more effective in reducing inflammation in the central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease. This would establish a theoretical basis for reducing neuronal death from central nervous system inflammation and provide an appropriate environment to promote neuronal regeneration in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; biomarker; central nervous system; cytokines; diabetes; inflammation; microglia; neuroinflammation; phagocytosis; tau,,"Wu, YG; Song, LJ; Yin, LJ; Yin, JJ; Wang, Q; Yu, JZ; Xiao, BG; Ma, CG"

Recall and recognition subtests of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status and their relationship to biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"Recently, two new recognition subtests for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) were developed and initially validated in a cohort of older adults who were cognitively intact or classified as amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current paper extends that validation by comparing the recall and recognition subtests of the RBANS, including the existing and recently developed scores, to three commonly used biomarkers in AD in an expanded sample from the initial validation. One hundred fifty-four older adults (65 intact, 46 MCI, 43 AD) were administered the RBANS, which included the recently developed subtests for Story Recognition and Figure Recognition (hits, false positives, total correct), as part of a study on memory and biomarkers. Participants also completed magnetic resonance imaging to obtain hippocampal volumes, positron emission tomography to obtain amyloid plaque deposition, and a blood draw to obtain APOE ε4 status. Whereas correlations between recall scores and biomarkers tended to be moderate (average r = ±0.48), these correlations were comparable across the three recognition total scores (average r = ±0.42), but tended to be lower for recognition hits (average r = ±0.28) and false positives (average r = ±0.38). These results further validate the existing and recently developed recognition scores on the RBANS as providing useful information about brain and genetic pathology in older adults with intact and impaired cognitive functioning.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; RBANS; biomarkers; neuropsychological assessment; recognition memory,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Mental Recall; Biomarkers; Neuropsychological Tests,"Euler, MJ; Duff, K; King, JB; Hoffman, JM"

Head-to-head comparison of 10 plasma phospho-tau assays in prodromal Alzheimer's disease.,"Plasma phospho-tau (p-tau) species have emerged as the most promising blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we performed a head-to-head comparison of p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 measured using 10 assays to detect abnormal brain amyloid-β (Aβ) status and predict future progression to Alzheimer's dementia. The study included 135 patients with baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (mean age 72.4 years; 60.7% women) who were followed for an average of 4.9 years. Seventy-one participants had abnormal Aβ-status (i.e. abnormal CSF Aβ42/40) at baseline; and 45 of these Aβ-positive participants progressed to Alzheimer's dementia during follow-up. P-tau concentrations were determined in baseline plasma and CSF. P-tau217 and p-tau181 were both measured using immunoassays developed by Lilly Research Laboratories (Lilly) and mass spectrometry assays developed at Washington University (WashU). P-tau217 was also analysed using Simoa immunoassay developed by Janssen Research and Development (Janss). P-tau181 was measured using Simoa immunoassay from ADxNeurosciences (ADx), Lumipulse immunoassay from Fujirebio (Fuji) and Splex immunoassay from Mesoscale Discovery (Splex). Both p-tau181 and p-tau231 were quantified using Simoa immunoassay developed at the University of Gothenburg (UGOT). We found that the mass spectrometry-based p-tau217 (p-tau217WashU) exhibited significantly better performance than all other plasma p-tau biomarkers when detecting abnormal Aβ status [area under curve (AUC) = 0.947; Pdiff < 0.015] or progression to Alzheimer's dementia (AUC = 0.932; Pdiff < 0.027). Among immunoassays, p-tau217Lilly had the highest AUCs (0.886-0.889), which was not significantly different from the AUCs of p-tau217Janss, p-tau181ADx and p-tau181WashU (AUCrange 0.835-0.872; Pdiff > 0.09), but higher compared with AUC of p-tau231UGOT, p-tau181Lilly, p-tau181UGOT, p-tau181Fuji and p-tau181Splex (AUCrange 0.642-0.813; Pdiff ≤ 0.029). Correlations between plasma and CSF values were strongest for p-tau217WashU (R = 0.891) followed by p-tau217Lilly (R = 0.755; Pdiff = 0.003 versus p-tau217WashU) and weak to moderate for the rest of the p-tau biomarkers (Rrange 0.320-0.669). In conclusion, our findings suggest that among all tested plasma p-tau assays, mass spectrometry-based measures of p-tau217 perform best when identifying mild cognitive impairment patients with abnormal brain Aβ or those who will subsequently progress to Alzheimer's dementia. Several other assays (p-tau217Lilly, p-tau217Janss, p-tau181ADx and p-tau181WashU) showed relatively high and consistent accuracy across both outcomes. The results further indicate that the highest performing assays have performance metrics that rival the gold standards of Aβ-PET and CSF. If further validated, our findings will have significant impacts in diagnosis, screening and treatment for Alzheimer's dementia in the future.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; blood p-tau; dementia,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Biomarkers,"Janelidze, S; Bali, D; Ashton, NJ; Barthélemy, NR; Vanbrabant, J; Stoops, E; Vanmechelen, E; He, Y; Dolado, AO; Triana-Baltzer, G; Pontecorvo, MJ; Zetterberg, H; Kolb, H; Vandijck, M; Blennow, K; Bateman, RJ; Hansson, O"

TMEM16F may be a new therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.,"TMEM16F is involved in many physiological processes such as blood coagulation, cell membrane fusion and bone mineralization. Activation of TMEM16F has been studied in various central nervous system diseases. High TMEM16F level has been also found to participate in microglial phagocytosis and transformation. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is a key factor in promoting the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, few studies have examined the effects of TMEM16F on neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we established TMEM16F-knockdown AD model in vitro and in vivo to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism about TMEM16F-mediated neuroinflammation in AD. We performed a Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory ability of animals and detected markers for the microglia M1/M2 phenotype and NLRP3 inflammasome. Our results showed that TMEM16F was elevated in 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice. After TMEM16F knockdown in mice, spatial memory ability was improved, microglia polarization to the M2 phenotype was promoted, NLRP3 inflammasome activation was inhibited, cell apoptosis and Aβ plaque deposition in brain tissue were reduced, and brain injury was alleviated.

Induction of ICAM1 in Brain Vessels is Implicated in an Early AD Pathogenesis by Modulating Neprilysin.,"Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) is a vessel adhesion protein induced during brain vascular inflammation, which could be closely linked with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the effect of ICAM1 on amyloid-degrading enzymes (ADEs) in endothelial cells and their potential involvement in inflammation and AD progression. TNF-α treatment increased ICAM1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs) but decreased the neprilysin (NEP) protein level. Knock-down of ICAM1 using siRNA enhanced NEP, which increased the degradation of amyloid-β. In the brains of 4-month-old AD transgenic mice (APPswe/PSEN1dE9), there were significantly higher levels of ICAM1 expression and amyloid deposits but lower levels of NEP and insulin-degrading enzymes (IDE), demonstrating an inverse correlation of ICAM1 with NEP and IDE expression. Further studies demonstrated significantly increased GFAP protein levels in the brain, specifically localized near blood vessels, of both TNF-α-injected and 4-month-old AD transgenic mice. Taken together, the induction of ICAM1 in endothelial cells suppresses NEP expression, accelerating the accumulation of amyloid-β in blood vessels. It also enhances leukocyte adhesion to blood vessels stimulating the migration of leukocytes into the brain, subsequently triggering brain inflammation.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Blood-brain barrier; Intercellular adhesion molecule 1; Neprilysin; Tumor necrosis factor-α,"Mice; Animals; Humans; Infant; Alzheimer Disease; Neprilysin; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Endothelial Cells; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mice, Transgenic; Insulysin; Brain","Otgongerel, D; Lee, HJ; Jo, SA"

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of the Brain After Ischemic Stroke: Mechanisms from Animal Models.,"Stroke is a common cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity, mortality, and disability worldwide. Post-stroke dysfunction is related to the death of neurons and impairment of synaptic structure, which results from cerebral ischemic damage. Currently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques are available to provide clinically effective interventions and quantitative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The development of TMS has been 40 years and a range of repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocols are now available to regulate neuronal plasticity in many neurological disorders, such as stroke, Parkinson disease, psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer disease, and so on. Basic studies in an animal model with ischemic stroke are significant for demonstrating potential mechanisms of neural restoration induced by rTMS. In this review, the mechanisms were summarized, involving synaptic plasticity, neural cell death, neurogenesis, immune response, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in vitro and vivo experiments with ischemic stroke models. Those findings can contribute to the understanding of how rTMS modulated function recovery and the exploration of novel therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of rTMS in treating ischemic stroke from animal models. rTMS can prompt synaptic plasticity by increasing NMDAR, AMPAR and BDNF expression; rTMS can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and facilitate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 by shifting astrocytic phenotypes from A1 to A2, and shifting microglial phenotypes from M1 to M2; rTMS facilitated the release of angiogenesis-related factors TGFβ and VEGF in A2 astrocytes, which can contribute to vasculogenesis and angiogenesis; rTMS can suppress apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting Bax, caspase-3 expression; rTMS can also suppress pyroptosis by decreasing caspase-1, IL-1β, ASC, GSDMD and NLRP1 expression. rTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors; AMPAR: α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; GSDMD: cleaved Caspase-1 cleaves Gasdermin D; CBF: cerebral blood flow.",2023,Blood–brain barrier; Ischemic stroke; Neurogenesis; Synaptic plasticity; rTMS,"Animals; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Ischemic Stroke; Brain; Stroke; Disease Models, Animal; Caspases","Xing, Y; Zhang, Y; Li, C; Luo, L; Hua, Y; Hu, J; Bai, Y"
Traumatic MicroRNAs: Deconvolving the Signal After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"History of traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a significant risk factor for development of dementia and neurodegenerative disorders in later life. While histopathological sequelae and neurological diagnostics of TBI are well defined, the molecular events linking the post-TBI signaling and neurodegenerative cascades remain unknown. It is not only due to the brain's inaccessibility to direct molecular analysis but also due to the lack of well-defined and highly informative peripheral biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in blood are promising candidates to address this gap. Using integrative bioinformatics pipeline including miRNA:target identification, pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interactions analysis we identified set of genes, interacting proteins, and pathways that are connected to previously reported peripheral miRNAs, deregulated following severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) in humans. This meta-analysis revealed a spectrum of genes closely related to critical biological processes, such as neuroregeneration including axon guidance and neurite outgrowth, neurotransmission, inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and response to DNA damage. More importantly, we have identified molecular pathways associated with neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, based on purely peripheral markers. The pathway signature after acute sTBI is similar to the one observed in chronic neurodegenerative conditions, which implicates a link between the post-sTBI signaling and neurodegeneration. Identified key hub interacting proteins represent a group of novel candidates for potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers.",2023,Neurodegeneration; Severe traumatic brain injury; Signaling pathways; TBI; miRNA,"Humans; MicroRNAs; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Brain Injuries; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Chronic Disease; Biomarkers","Cente, M; Matyasova, K; Csicsatkova, N; Tomikova, A; Porubska, S; Niu, Y; Majdan, M; Filipcik, P; Jurisica, I"

The many facets of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and its inhibitors in disorders of the CNS - a critical overview.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a serine protease that cleaves X-proline or X-alanine in the penultimate position. Natural substrates of the enzyme are glucagon-like peptide-1, glucagon inhibiting peptide, glucagon, neuropeptide Y, secretin, substance P, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, endorphins, endomorphins, brain natriuretic peptide, beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone and amyloid peptides as well as some cytokines and chemokines. The enzyme is involved in the maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis and regulation of the immune system. It is expressed in many organs including the brain. DPP4 activity may be effectively depressed by DPP4 inhibitors. Apart from enzyme activity, DPP4 acts as a cell surface (co)receptor, associates with adeosine deaminase, interacts with extracellular matrix, and controls cell migration and differentiation. This review aims at revealing the impact of DPP4 and DPP4 inhibitors for several brain diseases (virus infections affecting the brain, tumours of the CNS, neurological and psychiatric disorders). Special emphasis is given to a possible involvement of DPP4 expressed in the brain.While prominent contributions of extracerebral DPP4 are evident for a majority of diseases discussed herein; a possible role of ""brain"" DPP4 is restricted to brain cancers and Alzheimer disease. For a number of diseases (Covid-19 infection, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and epilepsy), use of DPP4 inhibitors has been shown to have a disease-mitigating effect. However, these beneficial effects should mostly be attributed to the depression of ""peripheral"" DPP4, since currently used DPP4 inhibitors are not able to pass through the intact blood-brain barrier.",2023,CD26; SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infection; cancer; central nervous system; enzyme inhibition; neurological and psychiatric disorders,"Humans; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon; COVID-19; Alzheimer Disease","Bernstein, HG; Keilhoff, G; Dobrowolny, H; Steiner, J"

Longitudinal changes in cerebral blood flow and their relation with cognitive decline in patients with dementia: Current knowledge and future directions.,"The pathophysiology underlying cognitive decline is multifactorial, with increasing literature suggesting a role for cerebrovascular health. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an important element of cerebrovascular health, which raises questions regarding the relation between CBF and cognitive decline. Cross-sectional studies demonstrate lower CBF in patients with cognitive decline compared to healthy age-matched peers. Remarkably, longitudinal studies do not support a link between CBF reductions and cognitive decline. These studies, however, are often limited by small sample sizes and may therefore be underpowered to detect small effect sizes. Therefore, through a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, we examined whether longitudinal changes in global CBF are related to cognitive decline in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, and qualitatively described findings on regional CBF. Considering the growing impact of dementia and the lack of treatment options, it is important to understand the role of CBF as a prognostic biomarker and/or treatment target in dementia.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; cerebrovascular circulation; cognition; dementia; meta-analysis; single-photon emission computed tomography; systematic review,Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Longitudinal Studies; Cerebrovascular Circulation,"Weijs, RWJ; Shkredova, DA; Brekelmans, ACM; Thijssen, DHJ; Claassen, JAHR"

Plasma biomarkers and genetics in the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease.,"Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease-related pathologies have undergone rapid developments during the past few years, and there are now well-validated blood tests for amyloid and tau pathology, as well as neurodegeneration and astrocytic activation. To define Alzheimer's disease with biomarkers rather than clinical assessment, we assessed prediction of research-diagnosed disease status using these biomarkers and tested genetic variants associated with the biomarkers that may reflect more accurately the risk of biochemically defined Alzheimer's disease instead of the risk of dementia. In a cohort of Alzheimer's disease cases [n = 1439, mean age 68 years (standard deviation = 8.2)] and screened controls [n = 508, mean age 82 years (standard deviation = 6.8)], we measured plasma concentrations of the 40 and 42 amino acid-long amyloid-β (Aβ) fragments (Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively), tau phosphorylated at amino acid 181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using state-of-the-art Single molecule array (Simoa) technology. We tested the relationships between the biomarkers and Alzheimer's disease genetic risk, age at onset and disease duration. We also conducted a genome-wide association study for association of disease risk genes with these biomarkers. The prediction accuracy of Alzheimer's disease clinical diagnosis by the combination of all biomarkers, APOE and polygenic risk score reached area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81, with the most significant contributors being ε4, Aβ40 or Aβ42, GFAP and NfL. All biomarkers were significantly associated with age in cases and controls (P < 4.3 × 10-5). Concentrations of the Aβ-related biomarkers in plasma were significantly lower in cases compared with controls, whereas other biomarker levels were significantly higher in cases. In the case-control genome-wide analyses, APOE-ε4 was associated with all biomarkers (P = 0.011-4.78 × 10-8), except NfL. No novel genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the case-control design; however, in a case-only analysis, we found two independent genome-wide significant associations between the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and WWOX and COPG2 genes. Disease prediction modelling by the combination of all biomarkers indicates that the variance attributed to P-tau181 is mostly captured by APOE-ε4, whereas Aβ40, Aβ42, GFAP and NfL biomarkers explain additional variation over and above APOE. We identified novel plausible genome wide-significant genes associated with Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in a sample which is 50 times smaller than current genome-wide association studies in Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Plasma biomarkers; genome-wide association study,"Humans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Amino Acids; Apolipoproteins E; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments","Stevenson-Hoare, J; Heslegrave, A; Leonenko, G; Fathalla, D; Bellou, E; Luckcuck, L; Marshall, R; Sims, R; Morgan, BP; Hardy, J; de Strooper, B; Williams, J; Zetterberg, H; Escott-Price, V"

Ultrasound deep brain stimulation decelerates telomere shortening in Alzheimer's disease and aging mice.,"Telomere length is a reliable biomarker for health and longevity prediction in both humans and animals. The common neuromodulation techniques, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) and optogenetics, have excellent spatial resolution and depth penetration but require implementation of electrodes or optical fibers. Therefore, it is important to develop methods for noninvasive modulation of telomere length. Herein, we reported on a new method for decelerating telomere shortening using noninvasive ultrasound deep brain stimulation (UDBS). Firstly, we found that UDBS could activate the telomerase-associated proteins in normal mice. Then, in the Alzheimer's disease mice, UDBS was observed to decelerate telomere shortening of the cortex and myocardial tissue and to effectively improve spatial learning and memory abilities. Similarly, UDBS was found to significantly slow down telomere shortening of the cortex and peripheral blood, and improve motor and cognitive functions in aging mice. Finally, transcriptome analysis revealed that UDBS upregulated the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. Overall, the present findings established the critical role of UDBS in delaying telomere shortening and indicated that ultrasound modulation of telomere length may constitute an effective therapeutic strategy for aging and aging-related diseases.",2023,Aging; Alzheimer's disease(AD); Brain stimulation; Noninvasive ultrasound; Telomere length,,"Zhang, Y; Pang, N; Huang, X; Meng, W; Meng, L; Zhang, B; Jiang, Z; Zhang, J; Yi, Z; Luo, Z; Wang, Z; Niu, L"
