Mechanism of action of miR-15a-5p and miR-152-3p in paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis through Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediation.,"miRNAs are small, conserved, single-stranded non-coding RNA that are typically transported by exosomes for their functional roles. The therapeutic potential of exosomal miRNAs has been explored in various diseases including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, skin diseases, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and glioma. Pathophysiological processes such as cellular inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis, immune dysfunction, and oxidative stress are closely associated with miRNAs. Internal and external factors such as tissue ischemia, hypoxia, pathogen infection, and endotoxin exposure can trigger these reactions and are linked to miRNAs. Paraquat-induced fibrosis is a protracted process that may not manifest immediately after injury but develops during bodily recovery, providing insights into potential miRNA intervention treatments.",2024,Lung fibrosis; Mechanism; Paraquat; Wnt/β-catenin; miRNA,MicroRNAs; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Paraquat; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Humans; Animals; beta Catenin,"Liu, D; Guan, Y"
Generation of an induced pluripotent stem cell line (CSBZZUi001-A) from a female Alzheimer's patient carrying the PSEN1 709 T > C heterozygous mutation.,"Pluripotent stem cells were generated through the electroporation of episomal plasmids, containing crucial reprogramming factors, into skin fibroblasts extracted from a female Alzheimer's patient harboring the PSEN1 709 T > C (p.Phe237Leu) heterozygous mutation. The pluripotent stem cells exhibit a normal karyotype and express pivotal stem cell markers including TRA-1-60, Nanog, SOX2, and OCT4. Furthermore, their capacity to differentiate into the three germ layers in in vivo teratoma experiments has been substantiated. The pluripotent stem cell line can serve as a cellular model for Alzheimer's disease, offering significant value in elucidating the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies of the disease.",2024,,,"Meng, XY; Sun, HF; Zhang, YJ; Li, WX; Wang, DD; Liu, DH; Li, SM; Wu, Y; Li, JK; Liu, XH; Liu, PP; Yang, RZ; Li, SA; Kang, JS"
The Skin and Lewy Body Disease.,"This manuscript reviews the significant skin manifestations of Lewy body disease, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and the diagnostic utility of skin biopsy. Besides classic motor and cognitive symptoms, non-motor manifestations, particularly dermatologic disorders, can play a crucial role in disease presentation and diagnosis. This review explores the intricate relationship between the skin and Lewy body disease. Seborrheic dermatitis, autoimmune blistering diseases (bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus), rosacea, and melanoma are scrutinized for their unique associations with Parkinson's disease, revealing potential links through shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Advances in diagnostic techniques allow the identification of promising biomarkers such as α-synuclein in samples obtained by skin punch biopsy. Understanding the dermatologic aspects of Lewy body disease not only contributes to its holistic characterization but also holds implications for innovative diagnostic approaches.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Lewy body disease; Parkinson’s disease; dementia with Lewy bodies; skin biopsy,,"Cassard, L; Honari, G; Tousi, B"
Implantable trilayer microneedle transdermal delivery system to enhance bioavailability and brain delivery of rivastigmine for Alzheimer treatment: A proof-of-concept study.,"Alzheimer's disease (ALZ) is a neurological disorder characterized by cognitive decline. Rivastigmine (RV), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is commonly used to treat ALZ. Unfortunately, RV is availablein capsule form, which is associated with low drug bioavailability, and in patch form, which can lead to skin irritation upon repeated use. This study successfully fabricated a trilayer dissolving microneedle (TDMN) containing RV with adequate mechanical strength by using the molding method. In vitro release and ex vivo permeation showed that the release and permeation of RV were significantly sustained compared to control without PCL. The release and permeation percentages were 91.34 ± 11.39 % and 13.76 ± 1.49 μg/cm",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Dissolving microneedle; Implant; Polycaprolactone; Rivastigmine; Trilayer,"Rivastigmine; Biological Availability; Administration, Cutaneous; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Brain; Drug Delivery Systems; Male; Rats; Needles; Proof of Concept Study; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drug Liberation; Skin Absorption; Skin","Ilyas, NRA; Putri, APD; Pratama, FA; Abdullah, DAP; Azzahra, KS; Permana, AD"

From Skin and Gut to the Brain: The Infectious Journey of the Human Commensal Fungus Malassezia and Its Neurological Consequences.,"The human mycobiome encompasses diverse communities of fungal organisms residing within the body and has emerged as a critical player in shaping health and disease. While extensive research has focused on the skin and gut mycobiome, recent investigations have pointed toward the potential role of fungal organisms in neurological disorders. Among those fungal organisms, the presence of the commensal fungus Malassezia in the brain has created curiosity because of its commensal nature and primary association with the human skin and gut. This budding yeast is responsible for several diseases, such as Seborrheic dermatitis, Atopic dermatitis, Pityriasis versicolor, Malassezia folliculitis, dandruff, and others. However recent findings surprisingly show the presence of Malassezia DNA in the brain and have been linked to diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The exact role of Malassezia in these disorders is unknown, but its ability to infect human cells, travel through the bloodstream, cross the blood-brain barrier, and reside along with the lipid-rich neuronal cells are potential mechanisms responsible for pathogenesis. This also includes the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, gut-microbe interaction, and accumulation of metabolic changes in the brain environment. In this review, we discuss these key findings from studies linking Malassezia to neurological disorders, emphasizing the complex and multifaceted nature of these cases. Furthermore, we discuss potential mechanisms through which Malassezia might contribute to the development of neurological conditions. Future investigations will open up new avenues for our understanding of the fungal gut-brain axis and how it influences human behavior. Collaborative research efforts among microbiologists, neuroscientists, immunologists, and clinicians hold promise for unraveling the enigmatic connections between human commensal Malassezia and neurological disorders.",2024,Malassezia; Blood-brain barrier; Central nervous system; Mycobiome; Neurological disorders,,"Naik, B; Sasikumar, J; Das, SP"

Does photobiomodulation alter mitochondrial dynamics?,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the leading causes of disease development. Dysfunctional mitochondria limit energy production, increase reactive oxygen species generation, and trigger apoptotic signals. Photobiomodulation is a noninvasive, nonthermal technique involving the application of monochromatic light with low energy density, inducing non-thermal photochemical effects at the cellular level, and it has been used due to its therapeutic potential. This review focuses on the mitochondrial dynamic's role in various diseases, evaluating the possible therapeutic role of low-power lasers (LPL) and light-emitting diodes (LED). Studies increasingly support that mitochondrial dysfunction is correlated with severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. Furthermore, a disturbance in mitofusin activity is also associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. The effects of PBM on mitochondrial dynamics have been observed in cells using a human fibroblast cell line and in vivo models of brain injury, diabetes, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, and skin injury. Thus, new therapies aiming to improve mitochondrial dynamics are clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that LPL and LED can be important therapies to improve health conditions when there is dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics.",2024,LED; fission; fusion; laser; mitochondrial dynamics; photobiomodulation,,"Trajano, LADSN; Siqueira, PB; Rodrigues, MMS; Pires, BRB; da Fonseca, AS; Mencalha, AL"

"Skin-brain axis in Alzheimer's disease - Pathologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications: A Hypothetical Review.","The dynamic interaction between the brain and the skin is termed the 'skin-brain axis.' Changes in the skin not only reflect conditions in the brain but also exert direct and indirect effects on the brain. Interestingly, the connection between the skin and brain is crucial for understanding aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have shown an association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various skin disorders, such as psoriasis, bullous pemphigoid, and skin cancer. Previous studies have shown a significantly increased risk of new-onset AD in patients with psoriasis. In contrast, skin cancer may reduce the risk of developing AD. Accumulating evidence suggests an interaction between skin disease and AD; however, AD-associated pathological changes mediated by the skin-brain axis are not yet clearly defined. While some studies have reported on the diagnostic implications of the skin-brain axis in AD, few have discussed its potential therapeutic applications. In this review, we address the pathological changes mediated by the skin-brain axis in AD. Furthermore, we summarize (1) the diagnostic implications elucidated through the role of the skin-brain axis in AD and (2) the therapeutic implications for AD based on the skin-brain axis. Our review suggests that a potential therapeutic approach targeting the skin-brain axis will enable significant advances in the treatment of AD.",2024,,,"Kim, HS; Jung, H; Park, YH; Heo, SH; Kim, S; Moon, M"
Omics data classification using constitutive artificial neural network optimized with single candidate optimizer.,"Recent technical advancements enable omics-based biological study of molecules with very high throughput and low cost, such as genomic, proteomic, and microbionics'. To overcome this drawback, Omics Data Classification using Constitutive Artificial Neural Network Optimized with Single Candidate Optimizer (ODC-ZOA-CANN-SCO) is proposed in this manuscript. The input data is pre-processing by using Adaptive variational Bayesian filtering (AVBF) to replace missing values. The pre-processing data is fed to Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA) for dimensionality reduction. Then, the Constitutive Artificial Neural Network (CANN) is employed to classify omics data. The weight parameter is optimized by Single Candidate Optimizer (SCO). The proposed ODC-ZOA-CANN-SCO method attains 25.36%, 21.04%, 22.18%, 26.90%, and 28.12% higher accuracy when analysed to the existing methods like multi-omics data integration utilizing adaptive graph learning and attention mode for patient categorization with biomarker identification (MOD-AGL-AM-PABI), deep learning method depending upon multi-omics data integration to create risk stratification prediction mode for skin cutaneous melanoma (DL-MODI-RSP-SCM), Deep belief network-base model for identifying Alzheimer's disease utilizing multi-omics data (DDN-DAD-MOD), hybrid cancer prediction depending upon multi-omics data and reinforcement learning state action reward state action (HCP-MOD-RL-SARSA), machine learning basis method under omics data including biological knowledge database for cancer clinical endpoint prediction (ML-ODBKD-CCEP) methods, respectively.",2024,Constitutive artificial neural network; Zebra Optimization Algorithm; omics data; single candidate optimizer,,"Madhan, S; Kalaiselvan, A"

Differentiating Prodromal Dementia with Lewy Bodies from Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease: A Pragmatic Review for Clinicians.,"This pragmatic review synthesises the current understanding of prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB) and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (pAD), including clinical presentations, neuropsychological profiles, neuropsychiatric symptoms, biomarkers, and indications for disease management. The core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)-parkinsonism, complex visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, and REM sleep behaviour disorder are common prodromal symptoms. Supportive clinical features of pDLB include severe neuroleptic sensitivity, as well as autonomic and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The neuropsychological profile in mild cognitive impairment attributable to Lewy body pathology (MCI-LB) tends to include impairment in visuospatial skills and executive functioning, distinguishing it from MCI due to AD, which typically presents with impairment in memory. pDLB may present with cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms, and/or recurrent episodes of delirium, indicating that it is not necessarily synonymous with MCI-LB. Imaging, fluid and other biomarkers may play a crucial role in differentiating pDLB from pAD. The current MCI-LB criteria recognise low dopamine transporter uptake using positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), loss of REM atonia on polysomnography, and sympathetic cardiac denervation using meta-iodobenzylguanidine SPECT as indicative biomarkers with slowing of dominant frequency on EEG among others as supportive biomarkers. This review also highlights the emergence of fluid and skin-based biomarkers. There is little research evidence for the treatment of pDLB, but pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for DLB may be discussed with patients. Non-pharmacological interventions such as diet, exercise, and cognitive stimulation may provide benefit, while evaluation and management of contributing factors like medications and sleep disturbances are vital. There is a need to expand research across diverse patient populations to address existing disparities in clinical trial participation. In conclusion, an early and accurate diagnosis of pDLB or pAD presents an opportunity for tailored interventions, improved healthcare outcomes, and enhanced quality of life for patients and care partners.",2024,Biomarkers; Clinical diagnosis; Early-stage dementia; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuropsychological profile; Psychiatric symptoms; Treatment planning,,"Wyman-Chick, KA; Chaudhury, P; Bayram, E; Abdelnour, C; Matar, E; Chiu, SY; Ferreira, D; Hamilton, CA; Donaghy, PC; Rodriguez-Porcel, F; Toledo, JB; Habich, A; Barrett, MJ; Patel, B; Jaramillo-Jimenez, A; Scott, GD; Kane, JPM"
The Aftermath of COVID-19: Exploring the Long-Term Effects on Organ Systems.,Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is a complicated disease that affects millions of people all over the world.

Alpha-lipoic Acid: An Antioxidant with Anti-Aging Properties for Disease Therapy.,"The anti-aging effects of alpha-lipoic acid (αLA), a natural antioxidant synthesized in human tissues, have attracted a growing interest in recent years. αLA is a short- -chain sulfur-containing fatty acid occurring in the mitochondria of all kinds of eukaryotic cells. Both the oxidized disulfide of αLA and its reduced form (dihydrolipoic acid, DHLA) exhibit prominent antioxidant function. The amount of αLA inside the human body gradually decreases with age resulting in various health disorders. Its lack can be compensated by supplying from external sources such as dietary supplements or medicinal dosage forms. The primary objectives of this study were the analysis of updated information on the latest two-decade research regarding the use of αLA from an anti-aging perspective. The information was collected from PubMed, Wiley Online Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov. Numerous in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies revealed that αLA shows a protective role in biological systems by direct or indirect reactive oxygen/nitrogen species quenching. αLA demonstrated beneficial properties in the prevention and treatment of many age-related disorders such as neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders, different cancers, nephropathy, infertility, and skin senescence. Its preventive effects in case of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are of particular interest. Further mechanistic and clinical studies are highly recommended to evaluate the wide spectrum of αLA therapeutic potential that could optimize its dietary intake for prevention and alleviation disorders related to aging.",2024,Free radicals; atherosclerosis; cancer; chelating metals; detoxification; diabetes; dosage forms; infertility; nanoformulations.; nephropathy; neurodegeneration; obesity; skin senescence,,"Shanaida, M; Lysiuk, R; Mykhailenko, O; Hudz, N; Abdulsalam, A; Gontova, T; Oleshchuk, O; Ivankiv, Y; Shanaida, V; Lytkin, D; Bjørklund, G"

The Olfactory Trail of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Alterations in olfactory functions are proposed as possible early biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases manifest olfactory dysfunction as a symptom, which is worth mentioning. The alterations do not occur in all patients, but they can serve to rule out neurodegenerative pathologies that are not associated with small deficits. Several prevalent neurodegenerative conditions, including impaired smell, arise in the early stages of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, presenting an attractive prospect as a snitch for early diagnosis. This review covers the current knowledge on the link between olfactory deficits and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The review also covers the emergence of olfactory receptors as actors in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Olfactory receptors are not exclusively expressed in olfactory sensory neurons. Olfactory receptors are widespread in the human body; they are expressed, among others, in the testicles, lungs, intestines, kidneys, skin, heart, and blood cells. Although information on these ectopically expressed olfactory receptors is limited, they appear to be involved in cell recognition, migration, proliferation, wound healing, apoptosis, and exocytosis. Regarding expression in non-chemosensory regions of the central nervous system (CNS), future research should address the role, in both the glia and neurons, of olfactory receptors. Here, we review the limited but relevant information on the altered expression of olfactory receptor genes in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. By unraveling how olfactory receptor activation is involved in neurodegeneration and identifying links between olfactory structures and neuronal death, valuable information could be gained for early diagnosis and intervention strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; ectopic expression; microglia; neurons; olfactory receptors,"Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Smell; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Olfaction Disorders; Receptors, Odorant","Franco, R; Garrigós, C; Lillo, J"
Evaluation of 3D-Printed Solid Microneedles Coated with Electrosprayed Polymeric Nanoparticles for Simultaneous Delivery of Rivastigmine and N-Acetyl Cysteine.,"In the current study, coated microneedle arrays were fabricated by means of digital light processing (DLP) printing. Three different shapes were designed, printed, and coated with PLGA particles containing two different actives. Rivastigmine (RIV) and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) were coformulated via electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA), and they were incorporated into the PLGA particles. The two actives are administered as a combined therapy for Alzheimer's disease. The printed arrays were evaluated regarding their ability to penetrate skin and their mechanical properties. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to further characterize the microneedle structure. Confocal laser microscopy studies were conducted to construct 3D imaging of the coating and to simulate the diffusion of the particles through artificial skin samples.

Understanding exosomes: Part 2-Emerging leaders in regenerative medicine.,"Exosomes are the smallest subset of extracellular signaling vesicles secreted by most cells with the ability to communicate with other tissues and cell types over long distances. Their use in regenerative medicine has gained tremendous momentum recently due to their ability to be utilized as therapeutic options for a wide array of diseases/conditions. Over 5000 publications are currently being published yearly on this topic, and this number is only expected to dramatically increase as novel therapeutic strategies continue to be developed. Today exosomes have been applied in numerous contexts including neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, central nervous system, depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorders, traumatic brain injury, peripheral nerve injury), damaged organs (heart, kidney, liver, stroke, myocardial infarctions, myocardial infarctions, ovaries), degenerative processes (atherosclerosis, diabetes, hematology disorders, musculoskeletal degeneration, osteoradionecrosis, respiratory disease), infectious diseases (COVID-19, hepatitis), regenerative procedures (antiaging, bone regeneration, cartilage/joint regeneration, osteoarthritis, cutaneous wounds, dental regeneration, dermatology/skin regeneration, erectile dysfunction, hair regrowth, intervertebral disc repair, spinal cord injury, vascular regeneration), and cancer therapy (breast, colorectal, gastric cancer and osteosarcomas), immune function (allergy, autoimmune disorders, immune regulation, inflammatory diseases, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis).

The β-Secretase BACE1 Drives Fibroblast Activation in Systemic Sclerosis through the APP/β-Catenin/Notch Signaling Axis.,"BACE1 is well-known for its role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Recent publications, including our own, have demonstrated a role for this enzyme in other chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of BACE1 in the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc). BACE1 protein levels were elevated in the skin of patients with SSc. Inhibition of BACE1 with small-molecule inhibitors or small interfering RNA blocked SSc and fibrotic stimuli-mediated fibroblast activation. Furthermore, we show that BACE1 regulation of dermal fibroblast activation is dependent on β-catenin and Notch signaling. The neurotropic factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor negatively regulates BACE1 expression and activity in dermal fibroblasts. Finally, sera from patients with SSc show higher β-amyloid and lower brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels than healthy controls. The ability of BACE1 to regulate SSc fibroblast activation reveals a therapeutic target in SSc. Several BACE1 inhibitors have been shown to be safe in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and could be repurposed to ameliorate fibrosis progression.",2024,Autoimmunity; Bace1; Fibrosis; Notch; Wnt,,"Wasson, CW; De Lorenzis, E; Clavane, EM; Ross, RL; Walker, KA; Caballero-Ruiz, B; Antinozzi, C; Wells, R; Migneco, G; Brown, JMY; Turvey, SJ; Simmons, KJ; Riobo-Del Galdo, NA; Di Luigi, L; McKimmie, CS; Del Galdo, F; Meakin, PJ"
Development of Telmisartan Nanocrystal-Based Dissolving Microneedle for Brain Targeting via Trigeminal Pathway: A Potentially Promising Treatment for Alzheimer's with an Improved Pharmacokinetic Profile.,"Telmisartan (TMN), an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drug, is being considered as an alternative therapy for Alzheimer's disease (ALZ). However, when taken orally, its low water solubility leads to a low bioavailability and brain concentration. To overcome this problem, TMN was formulated as nanocrystals (NC), then incorporated into dissolving microneedles (DMN) to enhance drug delivery to the brain via the trigeminal route on the face. TMN-NC was formulated with 1% PVA using the top-down method and stirred for 12 h, producing the smallest particle size of 132 ± 11 nm and showing a better release profile, reaching 89.51 ± 7.52% (2 times greater than pure TMN). TMN-NC-DMN with a combination of 15% PVA and 25% PVP showed optimal mechanical strength and penetration ability; they could dissolve completely within 15 min, and their surface pH was safe for the skin. The permeation test of TMN-NC-DMN showed the highest concentration, reaching 285.80 ± 32.12 μg/mL, compared to TMN-DMN and patch control, which only reached 87.17 ± 11.24 and 94.00 ± 11.09 μg/mL, respectively. The TMN-NC-DMN combination showed better bioavailability and was found to be well-delivered to the brain without any irritation to the skin.

Telomere length and micronuclei trajectories in APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: Correlating with cognitive impairment and brain amyloidosis in a sexually dimorphic manner.,"Although studies have demonstrated that genome instability is accumulated in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the specific types of genome instability linked to AD pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we report the first characterization of the age- and sex-related trajectories of telomere length (TL) and micronuclei in APP/PS1 mice model and wild-type (WT) controls (C57BL/6). TL was measured in brain (prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, pituitary gland, and hippocampus), colon and skin, and MN was measured in bone marrow in 6- to 14-month-old mice. Variation in TL was attributable to tissue type, age, genotype and, to a lesser extent, sex. Compared to WT, APP/PS1 had a significantly shorter baseline TL across all examined tissues. TL was inversely associated with age in both genotypes and TL shortening was accelerated in brain of APP/PS1. Age-related increase of micronuclei was observed in both genotypes but was accelerated in APP/PS1. We integrated TL and micronuclei data with data on cognition performance and brain amyloidosis. TL and micronuclei were linearly correlated with cognition performance or Aβ",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Morris water maze test; amyloid β; genome instability; micronuclei; sexual dimorphism; telomere length,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Mice; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloidosis; Female; Cognitive Dysfunction; Male; Mice, Transgenic; Brain; Telomere; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Sex Characteristics; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Presenilin-1; Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective","Guo, X; Li, J; Qi, Y; Chen, J; Jiang, M; Zhu, L; Liu, Z; Wang, H; Wang, G; Wang, X"
,"β-Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has shown promising effects on intestinal health, and it is extensively applied as an anti-aging and Alzheimer's disease therapeutic, due to its medicinal properties. The effects of NMN on the growth of mouse hair were observed after hair removal. The results indicated that NMN can reverse the state of hair follicle atrophy, hair thinning, and hair sparsity induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), compared to that of minoxidil. In addition, the action mechanisms of NMN promoting hair growth in cultured human dermal papilla cells (HDPCs) treated with DHT were investigated in detail. The incubation of HDPCs with DHT led to a decrease in cell viability and the release of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1Beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor Alpha (TNF-α). It was found that NMN can significantly lower the release of inflammatory factors induced by DHT in HDPCs. HDPCs cells are protected from oxidative stress damage by NMN, which inhibits the NF-κB p65 inflammatory signaling pathway. Moreover, the levels of androgen receptor (AR), dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), and β-catenin in the HDPCs were assessed using PCR, indicating that NMN can significantly enhance the expression of VEGF, reduced IL-6 levels and suppress the expression of AR and DKK-1, and notably increase β-catenin expression in DHT-induced HDPCs.",2024,androgenetic alopecia; dermal papilla cell; minoxidil; β-Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN),Animals; Mice; Humans; beta Catenin; Nicotinamide Mononucleotide; Interleukin-6; Hair; Hair Follicle; Dihydrotestosterone; Cell Proliferation; Oxidative Stress,"Xu, C; Dai, J; Ai, H; Du, W; Ji, H"
The Potential Use of Vitamin D3 and Phytochemicals for Their Anti-Ageing Effects.,"Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D3 is synthesised in skin cells in the body. Vitamin D3 has been known as a bone-related hormone. Recently, however, it has been considered as an immune vitamin. Vitamin D3 deficiency influences the onset of a variety of diseases. Vitamin D3 regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) through binding to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) in immune cells. Since blood levels of vitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) were low in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, there has been growing interest in the importance of vitamin D3 to maintaining a healthy condition. On the other hand, phytochemicals are compounds derived from plants with over 7000 varieties and have various biological activities. They mainly have health-promoting effects and are classified as terpenoids, carotenoids, flavonoids, etc. Flavonoids are known as the anti-inflammatory compounds that control TNF-α production. Chronic inflammation is induced by the continuous production of TNF-α and is the fundamental cause of diseases like obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, heart and brain diseases, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. In addition, the ageing process is induced by chronic inflammation. This review explains the cooperative effects of vitamin D3 and phytochemicals in the suppression of inflammatory responses, how it balances the natural immune response, and its link to anti-ageing effects. In addition, vitamin D3 and phytochemicals synergistically contribute to anti-ageing by working with ageing-related genes. Furthermore, prevention of ageing processes induced by the chronic inflammation requires the maintenance of healthy gut microbiota, which is related to daily dietary habits. In this regard, supplementation of vitamin D3 and phytochemicals plays an important role. Recently, the association of the prevention of the non-disease condition called ""ME-BYO"" with the maintenance of a healthy condition has been an attractive regimen, and the anti-ageing effect discussed here is important for a healthy and long life.",2024,ME-BYO; anti-ageing; chronic inflammation; cytokine storms; phytochemicals; vitamin D,Humans; Cholecalciferol; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Aging; Flavonoids; Inflammation; Phytochemicals; Vitamin D,"Santa, K; Kumazawa, Y; Watanabe, K; Nagaoka, I"

Pre-asthma: a useful concept for prevention and disease-modification? A EUFOREA paper. Part 1-allergic asthma.,"Asthma, which affects some 300 million people worldwide and caused 455,000 deaths in 2019, is a significant burden to suffers and to society. It is the most common chronic disease in children and represents one of the major causes for years lived with disability. Significant efforts are made by organizations such as WHO in improving the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of asthma. However asthma prevention has been less studied. Currently there is a concept of pre- diabetes which allows a reduction in full blown diabetes if diet and exercise are undertaken. Similar predictive states are found in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this paper we explore the possibilities for asthma prevention, both at population level and also investigate the possibility of defining a state of pre-asthma, in which intensive treatment could reduce progression to asthma. Since asthma is a heterogeneous condition, this paper is concerned with allergic asthma. A subsequent one will deal with late onset eosinophilic asthma.",2023,asthma; asthma natural history; pre-asthma; predisposition; quality of life; risk factors,,"Scadding, GK; McDonald, M; Backer, V; Scadding, G; Bernal-Sprekelsen, M; Conti, DM; De Corso, E; Diamant, Z; Gray, C; Hopkins, C; Jesenak, M; Johansen, P; Kappen, J; Mullol, J; Price, D; Quirce, S; Reitsma, S; Salmi, S; Senior, B; Thyssen, JP; Wahn, U; Hellings, PW"
"Analysis of SIKVAV's receptor affinity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacological characteristics: a matrikine with potent biological function.","Matrikines are biologically active peptides generated from fragments fragmentation of extracellular matrix components (ECM) that are functionally distinct from the original full-length molecule. The active matricryptic sites can be unmasked by ECM components enzymatic degradation or multimerization, heterotypic binding, adsorption to other molecules, cell-mediated mechanical forces, exposure to reactive oxygen species, ECM denaturation, and others. Laminin α1-derived peptide (SIKVAV) is a bioactive peptide derived from laminin-111 that participates in tumor development, cell proliferation, angiogenesis in various cell types. SIKVAV has also a potential pharmaceutical activity that may be used for tissue regeneration and bioengineering in Alzheimer's disease and muscular dystrophies. In this work, we made computational analyzes of SIKVAV regarding the ADMET panel, that stands for Administration, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. Docking analyzes using the α3β1 and α6β1 integrin receptors were performed to fill in the gaps in the SIKVAV's signaling pathway and coupling tests showed that SIKVAV can interact with both receptors. Moreover, there is no indication of cytotoxicity, mutagenic or carcinogenic activity, skin or oral sensitivity. Our analysis suggests that SIKVAV has a high probability of interacting with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (NR-PPAR-γ), which has anti-inflammatory activity. The results of bioinformatics can help understand the participation of SIKVAV in homeostasis and influence the understanding of how this peptide can act as a biological asset in the control of dystrophies, neurodegenerative diseases, and tissue engineering.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

"Skin autofluorescence, reflecting accumulation of advanced glycation end products, and the risk of dementia in a population-based cohort.","Conditions such as hyperglycemia and oxidative stress lead to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are harmful compounds that have been implicated in dementia. Within the Rotterdam Study, we measured skin AGEs as skin autofluorescence, reflecting long-term accumulation of AGEs, and determined their association with the risk of dementia and with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. Skin autofluorescence was measured between 2013 and 2016 in 2922 participants without dementia. Of these, 1504 also underwent brain MRI, on which measures of brain atrophy and cerebral small vessel disease were assessed. All participants were followed for the incidence of dementia until 2020. Of 2922 participants (mean age 72.6 years, 57% women), 123 developed dementia. Higher skin autofluorescence (per standard deviation) was associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio 1.21 [95% confidence interval 1.01-1.46]) and Alzheimer's disease (1.19 [0.97-1.47]), independently of age and other studied potential confounders. Stronger effects were seen in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (1.34 [0.98-1.82]) and in participants with diabetes (1.35 [0.94-1.94]). Participants with higher skin autofluorescence levels also had smaller total brain volumes and smaller hippocampus volumes on MRI, and they had more often lacunes.

"Vitamin D, Calbindin, and calcium signaling: Unraveling the Alzheimer's connection.","Calcium is a ubiquitous second messenger that is indispensable in regulating neurotransmission and memory formation. A precise intracellular calcium level is achieved through the concerted action of calcium channels, and calcium exerts its effect by binding to an array of calcium-binding proteins, including calmodulin (CAM), calcium-calmodulin complex-dependent protein kinase-II (CAMK-II), calbindin (CAL), and calcineurin (CAN). Calbindin orchestrates a plethora of signaling events that regulate synaptic transmission and depolarizing signals. Vitamin D, an endogenous fat-soluble metabolite, is synthesized in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet B radiation. It modulates calcium signaling by increasing the expression of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), stimulating phospholipase C activity, and regulating the expression of calcium channels such as TRPV6. Vitamin D also modulates the activity of calcium-binding proteins, including CAM and calbindin, and increases their expression. Calbindin, a high-affinity calcium-binding protein, is involved in calcium buffering and transport in neurons. It has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and caspase-3 activity stimulated by presenilin 1 and 2 in AD. Whereas CAM, another calcium-binding protein, is implicated in regulating neurotransmitter release and memory formation by phosphorylating CAN, CAMK-II, and other calcium-regulated proteins. CAMK-II and CAN regulate actin-induced spine shape changes, which are further modulated by CAM. Low levels of both calbindin and vitamin D are attributed to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Further research on vitamin D via calbindin-CAMK-II signaling may provide newer insights, revealing novel therapeutic targets and strategies for treatment.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; CAMK-II; Calbindin; Calcium binding protein; Calcium signaling; Calmodulin; Vitamin D,Humans; Vitamin D; Calcium Signaling; Calbindins; Calmodulin; Calcium; Alzheimer Disease; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Calcium Channels; Calcineurin; Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2,"Acharya, M; Singh, N; Gupta, G; Tambuwala, MM; Aljabali, AAA; Chellappan, DK; Dua, K; Goyal, R"
Enabling Lipidomic Biomarker Studies for Protected Populations by Combining Noninvasive Fingerprint Sampling with MS Analysis and Machine Learning.,"Triacylglycerols and wax esters are two lipid classes that have been linked to diseases, including autism, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, cardiovascular disease, dry eye disease, and diabetes, and thus are molecules worthy of biomarker exploration studies. Since triacylglycerols and wax esters make up the majority of skin-surface lipid secretions, a viable sampling method for these potential biomarkers would be that of groomed latent fingerprints. Currently, however, blood-based sampling protocols predominate in the field. The invasiveness of a blood draw limits its utility to protected populations, including children and the elderly. Herein we describe a noninvasive means for sample collection (from fingerprints) paired with fast MS data-acquisition (MassIVE data set MSV000092742) and efficient data analysis via machine learning. Using both supervised and unsupervised classification, we demonstrate the usefulness of this method in determining whether a variable of interest imparts measurable change within the lipidomic data set. As a proof-of-concept, we show that the method is capable of distinguishing between the fingerprints of different individuals as well as between anatomical sebum collection regions. This noninvasive, high-throughput approach enables future lipidomic biomarker researchers to more easily include underrepresented, protected populations, such as children and the elderly, thus moving the field closer to definitive disease diagnoses that apply to all.",2024,biomarkers; fingerprints; lipidomics; lipids; machine learning; mass spectrometry; noninvasive sampling,,"Isom, M; Go, EP; Desaire, H"
Fluid and tissue biomarkers in Parkinson's disease: Immunodetection or seed amplification? Central or peripheral?,"Over the last two decades there have been meaningful developments on biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, extensively (but not solely) focusing on their proteinopathic nature. Accordingly, in Alzheimer's disease determination of levels of total and phosphorylated tau (τ and p-τ, usually p-τ181) along with amyloid-beta1-42 (Aβ1-42) by immunodetection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and currently even in peripheral blood, have been widely accepted and introduced to routine diagnosis. In the case of Parkinson's disease, α-synuclein as a potential biomarker (both for diagnosis and progression tracking) has proved more elusive under the immunodetection approach. In recent years, the emergence of the so-called seed amplification assays is proving to be a game-changer, with mounting evidence under different technical approaches and using a variety of biofluids or tissues, yielding promising diagnostic accuracies.

Toxicity Evaluation of Anti-cholinesterasic Amphibian Extracts by MTT and an Optimized Artemia salina Test.,"The amphibian skin is an important source of bioactive compounds. Recently, our workgroup reported the bioactivity of new extracts from the Hylidae, Microhylidae and Leptodactylidae families against several pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease. However, since cytotoxicity can be a limiting factor for their applicability, we evaluated the toxicity of nine amphibian skin extracts with reported anticholinesterase activity, using the traditional MTT assay and an optimized Artemia salina test. The proposed improvement, guided by experimental design, aims to reduce the amount of biological sample needed. Overall, we proved that the active extracts were non-toxic at effective concentration against cholinesterases (AChE/BChE), positioning the amphibian skin as a promising and preliminary safe source of bioactive compounds in the anti-Alzheimer's treatment. Interestingly, we demonstrated that both toxicity assays can discriminate between toxic and non-toxic samples.

Intrinsic factors behind long COVID: III. Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and its components.,"Considerable research has been done in investigating SARS-CoV-2 infection, its characteristics, and host immune response. However, debate is still ongoing over the emergence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). A multitude of long-lasting symptoms have been reported several weeks after the primary acute SARS-CoV-2 infection that resemble several other viral infections. Thousands of research articles have described various post-COVID-19 conditions. Yet, the evidence around these ongoing health problems, the reasons behind them, and their molecular underpinnings are scarce. These persistent symptoms are also known as long COVID-19. The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and/or its components in host tissues can lead to long COVID. For example, the presence of viral nucleocapsid protein and RNA was detected in the skin, appendix, and breast tissues of some long COVID patients. The persistence of viral RNA was reported in multiple anatomic sites, including non-respiratory tissues such as the adrenal gland, ocular tissue, small intestine, lymph nodes, myocardium, and sciatic nerve. Distinctive viral spike sequence variants were also found in non-respiratory tissues. Interestingly, prolonged detection of viral subgenomic RNA was observed across all tissues, sometimes in multiple tissues of the same patient, which likely reflects recent but defective viral replication. Moreover, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was noticed throughout the brain at autopsy, as late as 230 days following symptom onset among unvaccinated patients who died of severe infection. Here, we review the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and its components as an intrinsic factor behind long COVID.

A comprehensive review on federated learning based models for healthcare applications.,"A disease is an abnormal condition that negatively impacts the functioning of the human body. Pathology determines the causes behind the disease and identifies its development mechanism and functional consequences. Each disease has different identification methods, including X-ray scans for pneumonia, covid-19, and lung cancer, whereas biopsy and CT-scan can identify the presence of skin cancer and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Early disease detection leads to effective treatment and avoids abiding complications. Deep learning has provided a vast number of applications in medical sectors resulting in accurate and reliable early disease predictions. These models are utilized in the healthcare industry to provide supplementary assistance to doctors in identifying the presence of diseases. Majorly, these models are trained through secondary data sources since healthcare institutions refrain from sharing patients' private data to ensure confidentiality, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning models due to the requirement of extensive datasets for training to achieve optimal results. Federated learning deals with the data in such a way that it doesn't exploit the privacy of a patient's data. In this work, a wide variety of disease detection models trained through federated learning have been rigorously reviewed. This meta-analysis provides an in-depth review of the federated learning architectures, federated learning types, hyperparameters, dataset utilization details, aggregation techniques, performance measures, and augmentation methods applied in the existing models during the development phase.

Emerging role of the host microbiome in neuropsychiatric disorders: overview and future directions.,"The human body harbors a diverse ecosystem of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively known as the microbiota. Current research is increasingly focusing on the potential association between the microbiota and various neuropsychiatric disorders. The microbiota resides in various parts of the body, such as the oral cavity, nasal passages, lungs, gut, skin, bladder, and vagina. The gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract has received particular attention due to its high abundance and its potential role in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the microbiota presents in other body tissues, though less abundant, also plays crucial role in immune system and human homeostasis, thus influencing the development and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, oral microbiota imbalance and associated periodontitis might increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, studies using the postmortem brain samples have detected the widespread presence of oral bacteria in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This article provides an overview of the emerging role of the host microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and discusses future directions, such as underlying biological mechanisms, reliable biomarkers associated with the host microbiota, and microbiota-targeted interventions, for research in this field.",2023,,Humans; Microbiota; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Brain; Alzheimer Disease,"Hashimoto, K"

Implications of intrinsic disorder and functional proteomics in the merkel cell polyomavirus life cycle.,"Infection with merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is implicated in the development of merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare but aggressive skin cancer. MCC has a mortality rate near 50%, and incidence has been rapidly increasing in recent decades, making development of improved treatment strategies critical to addressing its growing social burden. The parallel increasing necessity for novel research to better understand MCPyV pathogenesis has prompted numerous studies in recent years, yet the role of intrinsic disorder in MCPyV proteins remains unexplored. This study carries out computational characterization of intrinsic disorder within the MCPyV proteome and suggests mechanisms that may contribute to the oncogenicity of the virus to invade and hijack host immune systems. Our analysis finds that significant levels of intrinsic disorder are present in proteins LT, ALTO, 57kT, and VP1, and suggests that regions of sT may also contain large, disordered regions. The investigation further shows correlation of disorder propensity with the outputs for functional predictors of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs), molecular recognition features (MoRFs), and propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Our findings indicate that MCPyV may use disorder and phase condensation to alter viral function that may accentuate or provide the basis for oncogenic activities. It is intended that this study will inform future experimental validation efforts around the phase separation capacity of MCPyV and its host protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, we hope to inform other investigators on the potential role of disorder in the MCPyV life cycle toward ultimately progressing the development of novel therapeutic agents.",2023,LLPS; intrinsic disorder; merkel cell carcinoma; polyomavirus; virus,,"Lanclos, N; Radulovic, P; Bland, J; Oganisyan, V; Radefeld, K; Uversky, VN"
In vitro methods to assess 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity.,"11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) converts inactive 11-keto-glucocorticoids to their active 11β-hydroxylated forms. It also catalyzes the oxoreduction of other endogenous and exogenous substrates. The ubiquitously expressed 11β-HSD1 shows high levels in liver and other metabolically active tissues such as brain and adipose tissue. Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 was found to ameliorate adverse metabolic effects of elevated glucocorticoids in rodents and humans, improve wound healing and delay skin aging, and enhance memory and cognition in rodent Alzheimer's disease models. Thus, there is an interest to develop 11β-HSD1 inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. This chapter describes in vitro methods to assess 11β-HSD1 enzyme activity for different purposes, be it in disease models, for the assessment of the kinetics of novel substrates or for the screening and characterization of inhibitors. 11β-HSD1 protein expression and preparations of the different biological samples are discussed first, followed by a description of a well-established and easily adaptable 11β-HSD1 enzyme activity assay. Finally, different readout methods are shortly described. This chapter should provide the reader with a toolbox of methods to assess 11β-HSD1 activity with instructions in the form of a decision tree for the choice and implementation of an appropriate enzyme activity assay.",2023,11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; Activity assay; Alzheimer’s disease; Diabetes; Inhibitor; Metabolic disease; Skin aging; Wound healing,Humans; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1; Glucocorticoids; Adipose Tissue; Liver,"Kley, M; Moser, SO; Winter, DV; Odermatt, A"

Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) cases are the main forms, over 95% of AD cases, but still poorly understood. Thereby there is a crucial need to develop in vitro models for studying this multifactorial disorder. Here, we report the reprogramming of skin fibroblasts from a 57-years-old male donor.

The bioaccessibility of adsorped heavy metals on biofilm-coated microplastics and their implication for the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.,"Microplastic (MP) tiny fragments (< 5 mm) of conventional and specialized industrial polymers are persistent and ubiquitous in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem. Breathing, ingestion, consumption of food stuffs, potable water, and skin are possible routes of MP exposure that pose potential human health risk. Various microorganisms including bacteria, cyanobacteria, and microalgae rapidly colonized on MP surfaces which initiate biofilm formation. It gradually changed the MP surface chemistry and polymer properties that attract environmental metals. Physicochemical and environmental parameters like polymer type, dissolved organic matter (DOM), pH, salinity, ion concentrations, and microbial community compositions regulate metal adsorption on MP biofilm surface. A set of highly conserved proteins tightly regulates metal uptake, subcellular distribution, storage, and transport to maintain cellular homeostasis. Exposure of metal-MP biofilm can disrupt that cellular homeostasis to induce toxicities. Imbalances in metal concentrations therefore led to neuronal network dysfunction, ROS, mitochondrial damage in diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Prion disorder. This review focuses on the biofilm development on MP surfaces, factors controlling the growth of MP biofilm which triggered metal accumulation to induce neurotoxicological consequences in human body and stategies to reestablish the homeostasis. Thus, the present study gives a new approach on the health risks of heavy metals associated with MP biofilm in which biofilms trigger metal accumulation and MPs serve as a vector for those accumulated metals causing metal dysbiosis in human body.",2023,Biofilm; Heavy metal; Microplastic; Neurodegeneration; Parkinson’s disease; Prion,"Humans; Adsorption; Bioaccumulation; Biofilms; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Microplastics; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Plastics","Pan, I; Umapathy, S; Issac, PK; Rahman, MM; Guru, A; Arockiaraj, J"
Characterization the prognosis role and effects of snoRNAs in melanoma patients.,"Melanoma is a melanocyte-derived malignant cancer and is known for its early metastasis and high mortality rates. It is a highly cutaneous tumour disease that could be related to the abnormal immune microenvironment, and the identification of reliable diagnostic and prognostic markers is crucial for improving patient outcomes. In the search for biomarkers, various types of RNAs have been discovered and recognized as reliable prognostic markers. Among these, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have emerged as a promising avenue for studying early diagnosis and prognostic markers in tumours due to their widespread presence in tissues, tumour specificity and stability. In our study, we analysed snoRNAs data from melanoma samples in the TCGA-SKCM cohort and developed a prognostic model comprising 12 snoRNAs (SNORD9, SNORA31, SNORD14E, SNORA14A, SNORA5A, SNORD83A, SNORA75, AL096855, AC007684, SNORD14A, SNORA65 and AC004839). This model exhibited unique prognostic accuracy and demonstrated a significant correlation with the immune infiltration tumour microenvironment. Additionally, analysis of the GSE213145 dataset, which explored the sensitivity and resistance of immune checkpoint inhibitors, further supported the potential of snoRNAs as prognostic markers for immunotherapy. Overall, our study contributes reliable prognostic and immune-related biomarkers for melanoma patients. These findings can offer valuable insights for the future discovery of novel melanoma treatment strategies and hold promise for improving clinical outcomes in melanoma patients.",2024,SnoRNA; immune checkpoint inhibitors; immune microenvironment; melanoma; prognostic model,"Humans; Melanoma; RNA, Small Nucleolar; Prognosis; Skin Neoplasms; Biomarkers; Tumor Microenvironment","Wang, LY; Song, JN; Chen, YX; Zhu, Y; Ren, HL; Li, QQ; Zhang, SH"
Licochalcone A: A Potential Multitarget Drug for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.,"Licochalcone A (Lico-A) is a flavonoid compound derived from the root of the Glycyrrhiza species, a plant commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. While the Glycyrrhiza species has shown promise in treating various diseases such as cancer, obesity, and skin diseases due to its active compounds, the investigation of Licochalcone A's effects on the central nervous system and its potential application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment have garnered significant interest. Studies have reported the neuroprotective effects of Lico-A, suggesting its potential as a multitarget compound. Lico-A acts as a PTP1B inhibitor, enhancing cognitive activity through the BDNF-TrkB pathway and exhibiting inhibitory effects on microglia activation, which enables mitigation of neuroinflammation. Moreover, Lico-A inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, a key enzyme involved in tau phosphorylation, and modulates the brain insulin receptor, which plays a role in cognitive processes. Lico-A also acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, leading to increased levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Ach) in the brain. This mechanism enhances cognitive capacity in individuals with AD. Finally, Lico-A has shown the ability to reduce amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD, and exhibits antioxidant properties by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key regulator of antioxidant defense mechanisms. In the present review, we discuss the available findings analyzing the potential of Lico-A as a neuroprotective agent. Continued research on Lico-A holds promise for the development of novel treatments for cognitive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Further investigations into its multitarget action and elucidation of underlying mechanisms will contribute to our understanding of its therapeutic potential.",2023,cognitive enhancement; multi-target therapy; neurodegeneration,Humans; Antioxidants; Alzheimer Disease; Acetylcholinesterase; Chalcones,"Olloquequi, J; Ettcheto, M; Cano, A; Fortuna, A; Bicker, J; Sánchez-Lopez, E; Paz, C; Ureña, J; Verdaguer, E; Auladell, C; Camins, A"
CDK6-mediated endothelial cell cycle acceleration drives arteriovenous malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.,"Increased endothelial cell (EC) proliferation is a hallmark of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The underlying mechanism and disease relevance of this abnormal cell proliferative state of the ECs remain unknown. Here, we report the identification of a CDK6-driven mechanism of cell cycle progression deregulation directly involved in EC proliferation and HHT vascular pathology. Specifically, HHT mouse liver ECs exhibited defects in their cell cycle control characterized by a G1/S checkpoint bypass and acceleration of cell cycle speed. Phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-RB1)-a marker of G1/S transition through the restriction point-significantly accumulated in ECs of HHT mouse retinal AVMs and HHT patient skin telangiectasias. Mechanistically, ALK1 loss of function increased the expression of key restriction point mediators, and treatment with palbociclib or ribociclib, two CDK4/6 inhibitors, blocked p-RB1 increase and retinal AVMs in HHT mice. Palbociclib also improved vascular pathology in the brain and slowed down endothelial cell cycle speed and EC proliferation.

Oral and Transdermal Rivastigmine for the Treatment of Anticholinergic Delirium: A Case Report.,Anticholinergic toxicity is a common cause of delirium in emergency department patients. The standard antidotal treatment for anticholinergic toxicity is physostigmine. Physostigmine functions as a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Rivastigmine is another member of this class currently approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

In-depth proteome analysis of brain tissue from Ewsr1 knockout mouse by multiplexed isobaric tandem mass tag labeling.,"EWS RNA binding protein 1 (EWSR1) is a multifunctional protein whose epigenetic signatures contribute to the pathogenesis of various human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, skin development, and tumorigenic processes. However, the specific cellular functions and physiological characteristics of EWSR1 remain unclear. In this study, we used quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics with tandem mass tag labeling to investigate the global proteome changes in brain tissue in Ewsr1 knockout and wild-type mice. From 9115 identified proteins, we selected 118 differentially expressed proteins, which is common to three quantitative data processing strategies including only protein level normalizations and spectrum-protein level normalization. Bioinformatics analysis of these common differentially expressed proteins revealed that proteins up-regulated in Ewsr1 knockout mouse are mostly related to the positive regulation of bone remodeling and inflammatory response. The down-regulated proteins were associated with the regulation of neurotransmitter levels or amino acid metabolic processes. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the physiological function and pathogenesis of EWSR1 on protein level. Better understanding of EWSR1 and its protein interactions will advance the field of clinical research into neuronal disorders.

Exploring the Skin Brain Link: Biomarkers in the Skin with Implications for Aging Research and Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostics.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are challenging to diagnose. Currently the field must rely on imperfect diagnostic modalities. A recent study identified differences in several key bio-mechano-physiological parameters of the skin between AD patients and healthy controls. Here, we visually align these differences with the relevant histological, aging, and embryological paradigms to raise awareness for these potential biomarkers. In a study conducted by Wu et al., a series of n = 41 patients (n = 29 with AD and n = 12 healthy controls) were evaluated, demonstrating that AD patients exhibit a less acidic skin pH, increased skin hydration, and reduced skin elasticity compared to healthy controls. We constructed a visual overview and explored the relevant paradigms. We present a visual comparison of these factors, highlighting four paradigms: (1) the findings emphasize a shared ectodermal origin of the brain and the skin; (2) functional systems such as micro-vascularization, innervation, eccrine excretory functions, and the extracellular matrix undergo distinct changes in patients with AD; (3) the human skin mirrors the alterations in brain stiffness observed in aging studies; (4) assessment of physiological features of the skin is cost-effective, accessible, and easily amenable for monitoring and integration with cognitive assessment studies. Understanding the relationship between aging skin and aging brain is an exciting frontier, holding great promise for improved diagnostics. Further prospective and larger-scale investigations are needed to solidify the brain-skin link and determine the extent to which this relationship can be leveraged for diagnostic applications.",2023,biomarker; brain stiffness; diagnostics; neurodegeneration,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Geroscience; Brain; Skin; Biomarkers,"Klostermeier, S; Li, A; Hou, HX; Green, U; Lennerz, JK"

Neuroprotective Role of Klotho on Dementia.,"Klotho, a gene found on chromosome 13q12, is involved in a variety of processes and signaling pathways in the human body related to vitamin D metabolism; cardiovascular, renal, musculoskeletal, and skin diseases; and cancer biology. However, more importantly, it has been linked to beneficial effects related to anti-aging. The levels of soluble Klotho in the blood have been found to decline with age, increasing the risk of age-related diseases. When the Klotho gene was silenced or defective, it caused a shorter lifespan. However, when the gene was overexpressed, it resulted in a longer lifespan. Klotho has positive benefits on the neurological system by causing a higher representation of useful longevity genes, preventing further neuronal damage, and offering neuroprotection. Thus, it has the potential to become a new treatment for many age-related diseases that cause dementia, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of Klotho's benefits and roles on various organ systems, specifically on nervous system disorders that lead to dementia.",2023,aging; alzheimer’s disease; dementia; klotho; neuroprotection,,"Ananya, FN; Ahammed, MR; Lahori, S; Parikh, C; Lawrence, JA; Sulachni, F; Barqawi, T; Kamwal, C"
Macrophage lineage cells-derived migrasomes activate complement-dependent blood-brain barrier damage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy mouse model.,"Accumulation of amyloid beta protein (Aβ) in brain vessels damages blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Macrophage lineage cells scavenge Aβ and produce disease-modifying mediators. Herein, we report that Aβ40-induced macrophage-derived migrasomes are sticky to blood vessels in skin biopsy samples from CAA patients and brain tissue from CAA mouse models (Tg-SwDI/B and 5xFAD mice). We show that CD5L is packed in migrasomes and docked to blood vessels, and that enrichment of CD5L impairs the resistance to complement activation. Increased migrasome-producing capacity of macrophages and membrane attack complex (MAC) in blood are associated with disease severity in both patients and Tg-SwDI/B mice. Of note, complement inhibitory treatment protects against migrasomes-mediated blood-brain barrier injury in Tg-SwDI/B mice. We thus propose that macrophage-derived migrasomes and the consequent complement activation are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CAA.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Blood-Brain Barrier; Mice, Transgenic; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Brain; Macrophages; Alzheimer Disease","Hu, M; Li, T; Ma, X; Liu, S; Li, C; Huang, Z; Lin, Y; Wu, R; Wang, S; Lu, D; Lu, T; Men, X; Shen, S; Huang, H; Liu, Y; Song, K; Jian, B; Jiang, Y; Qiu, W; Liu, Q; Lu, Z; Cai, W"
Assessment of relationships between bullous pemphigoid and neurological diseases: A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most prevalent autoimmune vesiculobullous skin illness that tends to affect the elderly. Growing evidence has hinted a correlation between BP and neurological diseases. However, existing observational studies contained inconsistent results, and the causality and direction of their relationship remain poorly understood. To assess the causal relationship between BP and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) adopted independent top genetic variants as instruments from the largest accessible genome-wide association studies (GWASs), with BP (n = 218 348), PD (n = 482 730), AD (n = 63 926), stroke (n = 446 696), and MS (n = 115 803). Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted mode methods, weighted median, and simple mode were performed to explore the causal association. Multiple sensitivity analyses, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) was used to evaluate horizontal pleiotropy and remove outliers. With close-to-zero effect estimates, no causal impact of BP on the risk of the four neurological diseases was discovered. However, we found that MS was positively correlated with higher odds of BP (OR = 1.220, 95% CI: 1.058-1.408, p = 0.006), while no causal associations were observed between PD (OR = 0.821, 95% CI: 0.616-1.093, p = 0.176), AD (OR = 1.066, 95% CI: 0.873-1.358, p = 0.603), stroke (OR = 0.911, 95% CI: 0.485-1.713, p = 0.773) and odds of BP. In summary, no causal impact of BP on the risk of PD, AD, MS and stroke was detected in our MR analysis. However, reverse MR analysis identified that only MS was positively correlated with higher odds of BP, but not PD, AD and stroke.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Mendelian randomization; Parkinson's disease; bullous pemphigoid; multiple sclerosis; stroke,"Aged; Humans; Pemphigoid, Bullous; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Nervous System Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Stroke","Shen, S; Chu, M; Miao, H; Li, L; Fang, H; Li, X; Zhu, Z; Bai, Y; Chen, J; Zhang, J; Shao, S; Dang, E; Zhang, C; Wang, G; Qiao, H"
A novel peptide 'T14' reflects age and photo-aging in human skin.,"T14 is a 14mer peptide derived from the C-terminus of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Once cleaved, it is independently bioactive of the parent molecule and enhances calcium influx in different cell types, in a range of scenarios: it binds to an allosteric site selectively on the alpha-7 receptor, where it modulates calcium influx and is thus a potential trophic agent, as already reported in a range of normal developmental scenarios. However, if inappropriately activated, this erstwhile beneficial effect converts to a toxic one, resulting in pathologies as disparate as Alzheimer's and various metastatic cancers. Given that epidermal keratinocyte cells have the same ectodermal origin as brain cells, as well as expressing AChE and the alpha-7 receptor, we have explored whether T14 plays a comparable role. Here we report that the T14 immunoreactivity is detectable in human keratinocytes with levels inversely related to age: this decrease is even more apparent with chronic photo-exposure and thus accelerated skin aging. We conclude that T14, an agent promoting cell growth and renewal in other parts of the body, also operates in skin, Moreover, monitoring of keratinocyte T14 levels might offer further insights into the now well reported link between degenerative diseases and epidermal cell profile.",2023,acetylcholinesterase peptide; age; keratinocyte; photo-aging; skin,Humans; Skin Aging; Acetylcholinesterase; Peptide Fragments; Calcium; Peptides; Keratinocytes,"Rocha, S; Ratés, SG; Moswete, T; Kalleberg, K; Villa, A; Harcup, JP; Greenfield, SA"
Pooled analysis of frontal lobe transcriptomic data identifies key mitophagy gene changes in Alzheimer's disease brain.,"The growing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming a global health challenge without effective treatments. Defective mitochondrial function and mitophagy have recently been suggested as etiological factors in AD, in association with abnormalities in components of the autophagic machinery like lysosomes and phagosomes. Several large transcriptomic studies have been performed on different brain regions from AD and healthy patients, and their data represent a vast source of important information that can be utilized to understand this condition. However, large integration analyses of these publicly available data, such as AD RNA-Seq data, are still missing. In addition, large-scale focused analysis on mitophagy, which seems to be relevant for the aetiology of the disease, has not yet been performed.",2023,ARF1; Alzheimer's disease; GABARAPL1; VCP; lysosome; mitochondria; mitophagy; transcriptomics,,"Mei, T; Li, Y; Orduña Dolado, A; Li, Z; Andersson, R; Berliocchi, L; Rasmussen, LJ"

Developing Biomarkers for the Skin: Biomarkers for the Diagnosis and Prediction of Treatment Outcomes of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory decline and cognitive impairment. Research on biomarkers can aid in early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, evaluating treatment efficacy, and advancing fundamental research. We conducted a cross-sectional longitudinal study to see if there is an association between AD patients and age-matched healthy controls for their physiologic skin characteristics, such as pH, hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), elasticity, microcirculation, and ApoE genotyping. The study used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of the Boxes (CDR-SB) scales as references to quantify the presence of disease, if any. Our findings demonstrate that AD patients have a dominantly neutral pH, greater skin hydration, and less elasticity compared to the control subjects. At baseline, the tortuous capillary percentage negatively correlated with MMSE scores in AD patients. However, AD patients who carry the ApoE E4 allele and exhibit a high percentage of tortuous capillaries and capillary tortuous numbers have shown better treatment outcomes at six months. Therefore, we believe that physiologic skin testing is a rapid and effective way to screen, monitor progression, and ultimately guide the most appropriate treatment for AD patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); ApoE genotype; biomarker; capillary microscopy; capillary tortuosity; elasticity; non-invasive diagnosis; pH level; prognosis; skin hydration; skin physiological test,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Longitudinal Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Treatment Outcome; Apolipoproteins E; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Neuropsychological Tests,"Wu, CY; Ho, CY; Yang, YH"
A New Generation of IMiDs as Treatments for Neuroinflammatory and Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) class, which includes the founding drug member thalidomide and later generation drugs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, has dramatically improved the clinical treatment of specific cancers, such as multiple myeloma, and it combines potent anticancer and anti-inflammatory actions. These actions, in large part, are mediated by IMiD binding to the human protein cereblon that forms a critical component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex ubiquitinates and thereby regulates the levels of multiple endogenous proteins. However, IMiD-cereblon binding modifies cereblon's normal targeted protein degradation towards a new set of neosubstrates that underlies the favorable pharmacological action of classical IMiDs, but also their adverse actions-in particular, their teratogenicity. The ability of classical IMiDs to reduce the synthesis of key proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-α levels, makes them potentially valuable to reposition as drugs to mitigate inflammatory-associated conditions and, particularly, neurological disorders driven by an excessive neuroinflammatory element, as occurs in traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and ischemic stroke. The teratogenic and anticancer actions of classical IMiDs are substantial liabilities for effective drugs in these disorders and can theoretically be dialed out of the drug class. We review a select series of novel IMiDs designed to avoid binding with human cereblon and/or evade degradation of downstream neosubstrates considered to underpin the adverse actions of thalidomide-like drugs. These novel non-classical IMiDs hold potential as new medications for erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a painful inflammatory skin condition associated with Hansen's disease for which thalidomide remains widely used, and, in particular, as a new treatment strategy for neurodegenerative disorders in which neuroinflammation is a key component.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; cereblon; erythema nodosum leprosum; immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs); neurodegeneration; neuroinflammation; pomalidomide; thalidomide; traumatic brain injury,Humans; Thalidomide; Immunomodulating Agents; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Multiple Myeloma; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Kopp, KO; Greer, ME; Glotfelty, EJ; Hsueh, SC; Tweedie, D; Kim, DS; Reale, M; Vargesson, N; Greig, NH"

Increased Risk of Dementia in Patients with Atopic Dermatitis: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder with bimodal incidence peaks in early childhood and middle-aged and older adults. Few studies have focused on the risk of dementia in AD. The aims of this study were to analyse the incidence, and risk factors for dementia in patients with AD. This nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study enrolled 38,391 adults ≥ 40 years of age with AD and 2,643,602 controls without AD from the Korean National Health Insurance System (NHIS) database from 2009 to 2016. The cumulative incidence probability of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or vascular dementia at 8 years was 50, 39, and 7 per 1,000 person-years in patients with AD, respectively. The adjusted risks of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio (HR), 1.072; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.026-1.120), and Alzheimer's disease (HR 1.051; 95% CI 1.000-1.104) were increased in patients with AD. The effect of AD on the development of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's dementia varied according to age and diabetes mellitus (all p for interaction, < 0.05).

"Aluminium in the Human Brain: Routes of Penetration, Toxicity, and Resulting Complications.","Aluminium (Al) is the most ubiquitous metal in the Earth's crust. Even though its toxicity is well-documented, the role of Al in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases remains debatable. To establish the basic framework for future studies, we review literature reports on Al toxicokinetics and its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dialysis encephalopathy (DE) from 1976 to 2022. Despite poor absorption via mucosa, the biggest amount of Al comes with food, drinking water, and inhalation. Vaccines introduce negligible amounts of Al, while the data on skin absorption (which might be linked with carcinogenesis) is limited and requires further investigation. In the above-mentioned diseases, the literature shows excessive Al accumulation in the central nervous system (AD, AUD, MS, PD, DE) and epidemiological links between greater Al exposition and their increased prevalence (AD, PD, DE). Moreover, the literature suggests that Al has the potential as a marker of disease (AD, PD) and beneficial results of Al chelator use (such as cognitive improvement in AD, AUD, MS, and DE cases).",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; alcohol use disorder; aluminium; autism spectrum disorder; dialysis encephalopathy; human brain; multiple sclerosis,Humans; Aluminum; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Central Nervous System; Parkinson Disease; Multiple Sclerosis,"Bryliński, Ł; Kostelecka, K; Woliński, F; Duda, P; Góra, J; Granat, M; Flieger, J; Teresiński, G; Buszewicz, G; Sitarz, R; Baj, J"

Cellular heterogeneity and stem cells of vascular endothelial cells in blood vessel formation and homeostasis: Insights from single-cell RNA sequencing.,"Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) that constitute the inner surface of blood vessels are essential for new vessel formation and organ homeostasis. ECs display remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity across different organs and the vascular tree during angiogenesis and homeostasis. Recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have allowed a new understanding of EC heterogeneity in both mice and humans. In particular, scRNA-seq has identified new molecular signatures for arterial, venous and capillary ECs in different organs, as well as previously unrecognized specialized EC subtypes, such as the aerocytes localized in the alveolar capillaries of the lung. scRNA-seq has also revealed the gene expression profiles of specialized tissue-resident EC subtypes that are capable of clonal expansion and contribute to adult angiogenesis, a process of new vessel formation from the pre-existing vasculature. These specialized tissue-resident ECs have been identified in various different mouse tissues, including aortic endothelium, liver, heart, lung, skin, skeletal muscle, retina, choroid, and brain. Transcription factors and signaling pathways have also been identified in the specialized tissue-resident ECs that control angiogenesis. Furthermore, scRNA-seq has also documented responses of ECs in diseases such as cancer, age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction. These new findings revealed by scRNA-seq have the potential to provide new therapeutic targets for different diseases associated with blood vessels. In this article, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of the vascular endothelial cell heterogeneity and endothelial stem cells associated with angiogenesis and homeostasis in mice and humans, and we discuss future prospects for the application of scRNA-seq technology.",2023,"CD157/Bst1, pathological angiogenesis; angiogenesis; clonal expansion; heterogeneity; single-cell RNA sequencing; vascular endothelial cells (VECs); vascular endothelial stem cells",,"Wakabayashi, T; Naito, H"

Review on Carbon Dot-Based Fluorescent Detection of Biothiols.,"Biothiols, such as cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy), and glutathione (GSH), play a vital role in gene expression, maintaining redox homeostasis, reducing damages caused by free radicals/toxins, etc. Likewise, abnormal levels of biothiols can lead to severe diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurotoxicity, hair depigmentation, liver/skin damage, etc. To quantify the biothiols in a biological system, numerous low-toxic probes, such as fluorescent quantum dots, emissive organic probes, composited nanomaterials, etc., have been reported with real-time applications. Among these fluorescent probes, carbon-dots (CDs) have become attractive for biothiols quantification because of advantages of easy synthesis, nano-size, crystalline properties, low-toxicity, and real-time applicability. A CDs-based biothiols assay can be achieved by fluorescent ""Turn-On"" and ""Turn-Off"" responses via direct binding, metal complex-mediated detection, composite enhanced interaction, reaction-based reports, and so forth. To date, the availability of a review focused on fluorescent CDs-based biothiols detection with information on recent trends, mechanistic aspects, linear ranges, LODs, and real applications is lacking, which allows us to deliver this comprehensive review.

Excisional biopsy was performed for suspected malignant lymphoma, and the biopsy revealed melanoma. Close examination of the skin, nasal cavity, oral pharyngeal and laryngeal cavities, and gastrointestinal tract were performed. No primary tumor was detected by these examinations, and the patient was diagnosed with cervical LN metastasis from melanoma of unknown primary of clinical stage T0N3bM0 stage IIIC. The patient refused cervical neck dissection because of his age and comorbidity of Alzheimer's disease and instead opted for proton beam therapy (PBT) at a total dose of 69 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 23 fractions. He did not receive any systemic therapy. The enlarged LNs shrunk slowly, and FDG PET/CT at 1 year after PBT showed that the right submandibular LN had shrunk from 27 to 7 mm in length, and there was no significant FDG accumulation.

Repurposing of phyto-ligand molecules from the honey bee products for Alzheimer's disease as novel inhibitors of BACE-1: small molecule bioinformatics strategies as amyloid-based therapy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases, manifesting dementia, spatial disorientation, language, cognitive, and functional impairment, mainly affects the elderly population with a growing concern about the financial burden on society. Repurposing can improve the traditional progress of drug design applications and could speed up the identification of innovative remedies for AD. The pursuit of potent anti-BACE-1 drugs for AD treatment has become a pot boiler topic in the recent past and to instigate the design of novel improved inhibitors from the bee products. Drug-likeness characteristics (ADMET: absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), docking (AutoDock Vina), simulation (GROMACS), and free energy interaction (MM-PBSA, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) analyses were performed to identify the lead candidates from the bee products (500 bioactives from the honey, royal jelly, propolis, bee bread, bee wax, and bee venom) for Alzheimer's disease as novel inhibitors of BACE-1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (1) receptor using appropriate bioinformatics tools. Forty-four bioactive lead compounds were screened from the bee products through high throughput virtual screening on the basis of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics characteristics, showing favorable intestinal and oral absorption, bioavailability, blood brain barrier penetration, less skin permeability, and no inhibition of cytochrome P450 inhibitors. The docking score of the forty-four ligand molecules was found to be between -4 and -10.3 kcal/mol, respectively, exhibiting strong binding affinity to BACE1 receptor. The highest binding affinity was observed in the rutin (-10.3 kcal/mol), 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid (-9.5 kcal/mol), nemorosone (-9.5 kcal/mol), and luteolin (-8.9 kcal/mol). Furthermore, these compounds demonstrated high total binding energy -73.20 to -105.85 kJ/mol), and low root mean square deviation (0.194-0.202 nm), root mean square fluctuation (0.0985-0.1136 nm), radius of gyration (2.12 nm), number of H-bonds (0.778-5.436), and eigenvector values (2.39-3.54 nm",2023,ADMET; Alzheimer’s disease; BACE1; Honeybee products; Molecular dynamics; Repurposing,Aged; Bees; Humans; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Molecular Docking Simulation; Ligands; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Drug Repositioning; Luteolin; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases,"Nisa, N; Rasmita, B; Arati, C; Uditraj, C; Siddhartha, R; Dinata, R; Bhanushree, B; Bidanchi, RM; Manikandan, B; Laskar, SA; Abinash, G; Pori, B; Roy, VK; Gurusubramanian, G"
Modifications of the endosomal compartment in fibroblasts from sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients are associated with cognitive impairment.,"Morphological alterations of the endosomal compartment have been widely described in post-mortem brains from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and subjects with Down syndrome (DS) who are at high risk for AD. Immunostaining with antibodies against endosomal markers such as Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) revealed increased size of EEA1-positive puncta. In DS, peripheral cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and fibroblasts, share similar phenotype even in the absence of AD. We previously found that PBMCs from AD patients have larger EEA1-positive puncta, correlating with brain amyloid load. Here we analysed the endosomal compartment of fibroblasts from a very well characterised cohort of AD patients (IMABio3) who underwent thorough clinical, imaging and biomarkers assessments. Twenty-one subjects were included (7 AD with mild cognitive impairment (AD-MCI), 7 AD with dementia (AD-D) and 7 controls) who had amyloid-PET at baseline (PiB) and neuropsychological tests at baseline and close to skin biopsy. Fibroblasts isolated from skin biopsies were immunostained with anti-EEA1 antibody and imaged using a spinning disk microscope. Endosomal compartment ultrastructure was also analysed by electron microscopy. All fibroblast lines were genotyped and their AD risk factors identified. Our results show a trend to an increased EEA1-positive puncta volume in fibroblasts from AD-D as compared to controls (p.adj = 0.12) and reveal enhanced endosome area in fibroblasts from AD-MCI and AD-AD versus controls. Larger puncta size correlated with PiB retention in different brain areas and with worse cognitive scores at the time of biopsy as well as faster decline from baseline to the time of biopsy. Finally, we identified three genetic risk factors for AD (ABCA1, COX7C and MYO15A) that were associated with larger EEA1 puncta volume. In conclusion, the endosomal compartment in fibroblasts could be used as cellular peripheral biomarker for both amyloid deposition and cognitive decline in AD patients.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Endosomes; Fibroblasts; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Positron-Emission Tomography","Xicota, L; Lagarde, J; Eysert, F; Grenier-Boley, B; Rivals, I; Botté, A; Forlani, S; Landron, S; Gautier, C; Gabriel, C; Bottlaender, M; Lambert, JC; Chami, M; Sarazin, M; Potier, MC"
Prospective use of amniotic mesenchymal stem cell metabolite products for tissue regeneration.,"Chronic disease can cause tissue and organ damage constituting the largest obstacle to therapy which, in turn, reduces patients' quality-adjusted life-year. Degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and infectious conditions such as hepatitis, cause physical injury to organs. Moreover, damage resulting from chronic conditions such as diabetes can also culminate in the loss of organ function. In these cases, organ transplantation constitutes the therapy of choice, despite the associated problems of immunological rejection, potential disease transmission, and high morbidity rates. Tissue regeneration has the potential to heal or replace tissues and organs damaged by age, disease, or trauma, as well as to treat disabilities. Stem cell use represents an unprecedented strategy for these therapies. However, product availability and mass production remain challenges. A novel therapeutic alternative involving amniotic mesenchymal stem cell metabolite products (AMSC-MP) has been developed using metabolites from stem cells which contain cytokines and growth factors. Its potential role in regenerative therapy has recently been explored, enabling broad pharmacological applications including various gastrointestinal, lung, bladder and renal conditions, as well as the treatment of bone wounds, regeneration and skin aging due to its low immunogenicity and anti-inflammatory effects. The various kinds of growth factors present in AMSC-MP, namely bFGF, VEGF, TGF-β, EGF and KGF, have their respective functions and activities. Each growth factor is formed by different proteins resulting in molecules with various physicochemical properties and levels of stability. This knowledge will assist in the manufacture and application of AMSC-MP as a therapeutic agent.",2023,Amniotic mesenchymal stem cell metabolite products; Growth factors; Molecular therapy; Quality-adjusted life-year; Stem cells; Tissue injury,,"Miatmoko, A; Hariawan, BS; Cahyani, DM; Dewangga, SS; Handoko, KK; Sahu, RK; Hariyadi, DM"
DNA Aβ42 immunization via needle-less Jet injection in mice and rabbits as potential immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia found in the elderly and disease progression is associated with accumulation of Amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ42) in brain. An immune-mediated approach as a preventive intervention to reduce amyloid plaques without causing brain inflammation is highly desirable for future clinical use. Genetic immunization, in which the immunizing agent is DNA encoding Aβ42, has great potential because the immune response to DNA delivered into the skin is generally non-inflammatory, and thus differs quantitatively and qualitatively from immune responses elicited by peptides, which are inflammatory with production of IFNγ and IL-17 cytokines by activated T cells. DNA immunization has historically been proven difficult to apply to larger mammals. A potential barrier to use DNA immunization in large mammals is the method for delivery of the DNA antigen. We tested jet injection in mice and rabbits and found good antibody production and safe immune responses (no inflammatory cytokines). We found significant reduction of amyloid plaques and Aβ peptides in brains of the DNA Aβ42 immunized 3xTg-AD mouse model. This study was designed to optimize DNA delivery for possible testing of the DNA Aβ42 vaccine for AD prevention in a clinical trial.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; DNA vaccine; Immunotherapy; Jet injection; Large mammals; Mouse models; Nesting behavior,"Mice; Rabbits; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Peptide Fragments; Immunotherapy; Brain; Cytokines; Immunization; Injections, Jet; DNA; Mice, Transgenic; Disease Models, Animal; Mammals","Lambracht-Washington, D; Fu, M; Wight-Carter, M; Riegel, M; Hynan, LS; Rosenberg, RN"
Net benefit of diagnostic tests for multistate diseases: an indicator variables approach.,"A limitation of the common measures of diagnostic test performance, such as sensitivity and specificity, is that they do not consider the relative importance of false negative and false positive test results, which are likely to have different clinical consequences. Therefore, the use of classification or prediction measures alone to compare diagnostic tests or biomarkers can be inconclusive for clinicians. Comparing tests on net benefit can be more conclusive because clinical consequences of misdiagnoses are considered. The literature suggested evaluating the binary diagnostic tests based on net benefit, but did not consider diagnostic tests that classify more than two disease states, e.g., stroke subtype (large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small-vessel occlusion, stroke of other determined etiology, stroke of undetermined etiology), skin lesion subtype, breast cancer subtypes (benign, mass, calcification, architectural distortion, etc.), METAVIR liver fibrosis state (F0- F4), histopathological classification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), prostate Gleason grade, brain injury (intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, cranial fracture) . Other diseases have more than two stages, such as Alzheimer's disease (dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive disability (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease, and preclinical presymptomatics due to Alzheimer's disease). In diseases with more than two states, the benefits and risks may vary between states. This paper extends the net-benefit approach of evaluating binary diagnostic tests to multi-state clinical conditions to rule-in or rule-out a clinical condition based on adverse consequences of work-up delay (due to false negative test result) and unnecessary workup (due to false positive test result). We demonstrate our approach with numerical examples and real data.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; benefit-risk; clinical utility; decision theory; diagnostic yield table; loss function; relative net-benefit,"Male; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stroke; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Neuropsychological Tests","Samawi, H; Ahmed, F; Pennello, G; Yin, J"
The paradigm of amyloid precursor protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: The potential role of the ,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive decline of neuronal function in several brain areas, and are always associated with cognitive, psychiatric, or motor deficits due to the atrophy of certain neuronal populations. Most neurodegenerative diseases share common pathological mechanisms, such as neurotoxic protein misfolding, oxidative stress, and impairment of autophagy machinery. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common adult-onset motor neuron disorders worldwide. It is clinically characterized by the selective and progressive loss of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord, ultimately leading to muscle atrophy and rapidly progressive paralysis. Multiple recent studies have indicated that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolytic fragments are not only drivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but also one of the earliest signatures in ALS, preceding or anticipating neuromuscular junction instability and denervation. Indeed, altered levels of APP peptides have been found in the brain, muscles, skin, and cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients. In this short review, we discuss the nature and extent of research evidence on the role of APP peptides in ALS, focusing on the intracellular C-terminal peptide and its regulatory motif ",2023,682YENPTY687 motif; Amyloid precursor protein; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Neurodegeneration,,"Matrone, C"
Mechanism of action and therapeutic effects of oxidative stress and stem cell-based materials in skin aging: Current evidence and future perspectives.,"Aging is associated with multiple degenerative diseases, including atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease. As the most intuitive manifestation of aging, skin aging has received the most significant attention. Skin aging results from various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Aged skin is characterized by wrinkles, laxity, elastosis, telangiectasia, and aberrant pigmentation. The underlying mechanism is complex and may involve cellular senescence, DNA damage, oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, and genetic mutations, among other factors. Among them, OS plays an important role in skin aging, and multiple antioxidants (e.g., vitamin C, glutathione, and melatonin) are considered to promote skin rejuvenation. In addition, stem cells that exhibit self-replication, multi-directional differentiation, and a strong paracrine function can exert anti-aging effects by inhibiting OS. With the further development of stem cell technology, treatments related to OS mitigation and involving stem cell use may have a promising future in anti-skin aging therapy.",2022,aging; materials; oxidative stress; skin; stem cell,,"Qian, H; Shan, Y; Gong, R; Lin, D; Zhang, M; Wang, C; Wang, L"
"A Proteome-Centric View of Ageing, including that of the Skin and Age-Related Diseases: Considerations of a Common Cause and Common Preventative and Curative Interventions.","The proteome comprises all proteins of a cell or organism. To carry their catalytic and structure-related functions, proteins must be correctly folded into their unique native three-dimensional structures. Common oxidative protein damage affects their functionality by impairing their catalytic and interactive specificities. Oxidative damage occurs preferentially to misfolded proteins and fixes the misfolded state. This review provides an overview of the mechanism and consequences of oxidative proteome damage - specifically irreversible protein carbonylation - in relation to ageing, including that of the skin as well as to age-related degeneration and diseases (ARDD) and their mitigation. A literature review of published manuscripts, available from PubMed, focusing on proteome, proteostasis, proteotoxicity, protein carbonylation, related inflammatory diseases, ARDD and the impact of the damaged proteome on ageing. During ageing, proteome damage, especially protein carbonylation, correlates with biological age. Carbonylated proteins form aggregates which can be considered as markers and accelerators of ageing and are common markers of most ARDD. Protein carbonylation leads to general ageing of the organism and organs including the skin and potentially to diseases including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, diabetes, psoriasis, and skin cancer. Current research is promising and may open new therapeutic approaches and perspectives by targeting proteome protection as an age and ARDD management strategy.",2023,antioxidant chemical chaperones; oxidative stress; protein carbonylation; protein folding; proteome; skin ageing,,"Benoit, I; Burty-Valin, E; Radman, M"
Insights into the perinatal phenotype of Kabuki syndrome in infants identified by genome-wide sequencing.,"Increasing use of unbiased genomic sequencing in critically ill infants can expand understanding of rare diseases such as Kabuki syndrome (KS). Infants diagnosed with KS through genome-wide sequencing performed during the initial hospitalization underwent retrospective review of medical records. Human phenotype ontology terms used in genomic analysis were aggregated and analyzed. Clinicians were surveyed regarding changes in management and other care changes. Fifteen infants met inclusion criteria. KS was not suspected prior to genomic sequencing. Variants were classified as Pathogenic (n = 10) or Likely Pathogenic (n = 5) by American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Guidelines. Fourteen variants were de novo (KMT2D, n = 12, KDM6A, n = 2). One infant inherited a likely pathogenic variant in KMT2D from an affected father. Frequent findings involved cardiovascular (14/15) and renal (7/15) systems, with palatal defects also identified (6/15). Three infants had non-immune hydrops. No minor anomalies were universally documented; ear anomalies, micrognathia, redundant nuchal skin, and hypoplastic nails were common. Changes in management were reported in 14 infants. Early use of unbiased genome-wide sequencing enabled a molecular diagnosis prior to clinical recognition including infants with atypical or rarely reported features of KS while also expanding the phenotypic spectrum of this rare disorder.",2023,Kabuki syndrome; infant; phenotype; unbiased genome-wide sequencing,"Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Infant; Abnormalities, Multiple; Face; Hematologic Diseases; Vestibular Diseases; Phenotype; Histone Demethylases","Wigby, K; Hammer, M; Tokita, M; Patel, P; Jones, MC; Larson, A; Bartolomei, FV; Dykzeul, N; Slavotinek, A; Yip, T; Bandres-Ciga, S; Simpson, BN; Suhrie, K; Shankar, S; Veith, R; Bragg, J; Powell, C; Kingsmore, SF; Dimmock, D; Maron, J; Davis, J; Del Campo, M"
Brain MRI findings in patients with bullous pemphigoid: A case-control study.,"Evidence suggests that bullous pemphigoid (BP) is associated with multiple neurological disorders. We aimed to compare brain magnetic resonance (MRI) findings between BP patients and a control group. This case-control study included patients with BP referred to two dermatology clinics during a two-year period. A group of individuals attending the same clinics for cosmetic procedures were selected as controls. First, participants' general information including age, gender, education, weight and underlying disease was recorded. For BP patients, the drugs and the BP Disease Area Index (BPDAI) were recorded as well. Then, all participants underwent brain MRI without contrast. The Fazekas scale, the general cerebral atrophy (GCA) score, and the Medial Temporal lobe Atrophy (MTA) score were used to assess MRI images. Overall, 24 BP patients and 24 controls were evaluated in this study. Both groups were comparable regarding age, gender and education. However, diabetes and hypertension were more frequent in the control group. The mean BPDAI total score was 51.39 ± 68.92 in BP patients and most of them used rituximab (41.7%). None of the participants had MS or Alzheimer MRI patterns. There was no difference between groups in terms of GCA and MTA scores. Furthermore, the frequency of partially empty sella did not differ significantly between BP patients and controls (p = 0.461); nevertheless, grade-3 Fazekas was significantly higher in BP patients compared to controls (25% vs. 0%, p = 0.019). Of note, one BP patient had an epidermoid cyst and another had moderate enlargement of three ventricles. Also, new infarcts were observed in two and old infarcts in four BP patients. Although the majority of abnormal brain MRI findings were more frequent in BP patients compared to controls, only grade-3 Fazekas was significantly higher and acute infarcts were exclusively observed in BP patients.",2023,brain MRI; bullous pemphigoid; neurological disorders,"Humans; Pemphigoid, Bullous; Case-Control Studies; Nervous System Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain","Ganji, R; Mahboubi-Fooladi, Z; Shahidi-Dadras, M; Tehranchinia, Z; Abdollahimajd, F; Ghalamkarpour, F; Robati, RM; Gheisari, M; Mozafari, N; Dadkhahfar, S; Nasiri, S"

Identification of Apolipoprotein D as a Dermal Fibroblast Marker of Human Aging for Development of Skin Rejuvenation Therapy.,"The current understanding of skin aging is that senescent fibroblasts accumulate within the dermis and subcutaneous fat to cause abnormal tissue remodeling and extracellular matrix dysfunction, triggering a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). A novel therapeutic approach to prevent skin aging is to specifically eliminate senescent dermal fibroblasts; this requires the identification of specific protein markers for senescent cells. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is involved in lipid metabolism and antioxidant responses and is abundantly expressed in tissues affected by age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. However, its behavior and role in skin aging remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether ApoD functions as a marker of aging using human dermal fibroblast aging models. In cellular senescence models induced through replicative aging and ionizing radiation exposure, ApoD expression was upregulated at the gene and protein levels and correlated with senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the decreased uptake of the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine, which was concomitant with the upregulation of SASP genes. Furthermore, ApoD-positive cells were found to be more abundant in the aging human dermis using fluorescence flow cytometry. These results suggest that ApoD is a potential clinical marker for identifying aging dermal fibroblasts.",2023,apolipoprotein; cellular senescence; dermis; fibroblast; senescence-associated secretory phenotype; skin aging,"Humans; Apolipoproteins D; Cells, Cultured; Cellular Senescence; Fibroblasts; Rejuvenation; Skin Aging","Takaya, K; Asou, T; Kishi, K"
"Sulfotransferase 2B1b, Sterol Sulfonation, and Disease.","The primary function of human sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) is to sulfonate cholesterol and closely related sterols.

Many are signaling molecules whose activities are redefined by sulfonation-allosteric properties are switched ""on"" or ""off,"" agonists are transformed into antagonists, and vice versa. Sterol sulfonation is tightly coupled to cholesterol homeostasis, and sulfonation imbalances are causally linked to cholesterol-related diseases including certain cancers, Alzheimer disease, and recessive X-linked ichthyosis-an orphan skin disease. Numerous studies link SULT2B1b activity to disease-relevant molecular processes. Here, these multifaceted processes are integrated into metabolic maps that highlight their interdependence and how their actions are regulated and coordinated by SULT2B1b oxysterol sulfonation. The maps help explain why SULT2B1b inhibition arrests the growth of certain cancers and make the novel prediction that SULT2B1b inhibition will suppress production of amyloid ",2023,,Humans; Sterols; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Sulfotransferases; Sulfates; Ichthyosis,"Cook, I; Leyh, TS"

Social cognition deficits and biometric signatures in the behavioural variant of Alzheimer's disease.,"The behavioural variant of Alzheimer's disease (bvAD) is characterized by early predominant behavioural changes, mimicking the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), which is characterized by social cognition deficits and altered biometric responses to socioemotional cues. These functions remain understudied in bvAD. We investigated multiple social cognition components (i.e. emotion recognition, empathy, social norms and moral reasoning), using the Ekman 60 faces test, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, empathy eliciting videos, Social Norms Questionnaire and moral dilemmas, while measuring eye movements and galvanic skin response. We compared 12 patients with bvAD with patients with bvFTD (n = 14), typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD, n = 13) and individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 13), using ANCOVAs and age- and sex-adjusted post hoc testing. Patients with bvAD (40.1 ± 8.6) showed lower scores on the Ekman 60 faces test compared to individuals with SCD (49.7 ± 5.0, P < 0.001), and patients with tAD (46.2 ± 5.3, P = 0.05) and higher scores compared to patients with bvFTD (32.4 ± 7.3, P = 0.002). Eye-tracking during the Ekman 60 faces test revealed no differences in dwell time on the eyes (all P > 0.05), but patients with bvAD (18.7 ± 9.5%) and bvFTD (19.4 ± 14.3%) spent significantly less dwell time on the mouth than individuals with SCD (30.7 ± 11.6%, P < 0.01) and patients with tAD (32.7 ± 12.1%, P < 0.01). Patients with bvAD (11.3 ± 4.6) exhibited lower scores on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index compared with individuals with SCD (15.6 ± 3.1, P = 0.05) and similar scores to patients with bvFTD (8.7 ± 5.6, P = 0.19) and tAD (13.0 ± 3.2, P = 0.43). The galvanic skin response to empathy eliciting videos did not differ between groups (all P > 0.05). Patients with bvAD (16.0 ± 1.6) and bvFTD (15.2 ± 2.2) showed lower scores on the Social Norms Questionnaire than patients with tAD (17.8 ± 2.1, P < 0.05) and individuals with SCD (18.3 ± 1.4, P < 0.05). No group differences were observed in scores on moral dilemmas (all P > 0.05), while only patients with bvFTD (0.9 ± 1.1) showed a lower galvanic skin response during personal dilemmas compared with SCD (3.4 ± 3.3 peaks per min, P = 0.01). Concluding, patients with bvAD showed a similar although milder social cognition profile and a similar eye-tracking signature to patients with bvFTD and greater social cognition impairments and divergent eye movement patterns compared with patients with tAD.

Phosphorylated α-synuclein in skin Schwann cells: a new biomarker for multiple system atrophy.,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-syn) as glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the brain and a specific biomarker for this disorder is urgently needed. We aimed at investigating if p-syn can also be detected in skin Remak non-myelinating Schwann cells (RSCs) as Schwann cell cytoplasmic inclusions (SCCi) and may represent a reliable clinical biomarker for MSA. This cross-sectional diagnostic study evaluated skin p-syn in 96 patients: 46 with probable MSA (29 with parkinsonism type MSA and 17 with cerebellar type MSA), 34 with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 16 with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We also included 50 healthy control subjects. Patients were recruited from five different medical centres. P-syn aggregates in skin sections were stained by immunofluorescence, followed by analyses with confocal microscopy and immuno-electron microscopy. All analyses were performed in a blinded fashion. Overall, p-syn aggregates were found in 78% of MSA patients and 100% of patients with PD/DLB, whereas they could not be detected in controls. As for neuronal aggregates 78% of MSA patients were positive for p-syn in somatic neurons, whereas all PD/DLB patients were positive in autonomic neurons. When analysing the presence of p-syn in RSCs, 74% of MSA patients were positive, whereas no such SCCi could be observed in PD/DLB patients. Analyses by immuno-electron microscopy confirmed that SCCi were only found in cases with MSA and thus absent in those with PD/DLB. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that (i) fibrillar p-syn in RSCs is a pathological hallmark of MSA and may be used as a specific and sensitive disease biomarker; (ii) in Lewy body synucleinopathies (PD/DLB) only neurons contain p-syn deposits; and (iii) the cell-specific deposition of p-syn in the skin thus mirrors that of the brain in many aspects and suggests that non-myelinated glial cells are also involved in the MSA pathogenesis.",2023,biomarker; fibrillar α-synuclein; multiple system atrophy; skin biopsy; skin non-myelinating Schwann cell,Humans; alpha-Synuclein; Multiple System Atrophy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Schwann Cells; Biomarkers; Lewy Body Disease,"Donadio, V; Incensi, A; Rizzo, G; Westermark, GT; Devigili, G; De Micco, R; Tessitore, A; Nyholm, D; Parisini, S; Nyman, D; Tedeschi, G; Eleopra, R; Ingelsson, M; Liguori, R"
"Artificial intelligence in disease diagnosis: a systematic literature review, synthesizing framework and future research agenda.","Artificial intelligence can assist providers in a variety of patient care and intelligent health systems. Artificial intelligence techniques ranging from machine learning to deep learning are prevalent in healthcare for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient risk identification. Numerous medical data sources are required to perfectly diagnose diseases using artificial intelligence techniques, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, mammography, genomics, computed tomography scan, etc. Furthermore, artificial intelligence primarily enhanced the infirmary experience and sped up preparing patients to continue their rehabilitation at home. This article covers the comprehensive survey based on artificial intelligence techniques to diagnose numerous diseases such as Alzheimer, cancer, diabetes, chronic heart disease, tuberculosis, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin, and liver disease.
