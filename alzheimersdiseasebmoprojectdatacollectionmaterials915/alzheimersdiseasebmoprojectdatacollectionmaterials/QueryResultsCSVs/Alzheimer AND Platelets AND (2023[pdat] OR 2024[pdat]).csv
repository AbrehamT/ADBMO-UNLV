c-KIT inhibitors reduce pathology and improve behavior in the Tg(SwDI) model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Treatments for Alzheimer's disease have primarily focused on removing brain amyloid plaques to improve cognitive outcomes in patients. We developed small compounds, known as BK40143 and BK40197, and we hypothesize that these drugs alleviate microglial-mediated neuroinflammation and induce autophagic clearance of neurotoxic proteins to improve behavior in models of neurodegeneration. Specificity binding assays of BK40143 and BK40197 showed primary binding to c-KIT/Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptors (PDGFR)α/β, whereas BK40197 also differentially binds to FYVE finger-containing phosphoinositide kinase (PIKFYVE). Both compounds penetrate the CNS, and treatment with these drugs inhibited the maturation of peripheral mast cells in transgenic mice, correlating with cognitive improvements on measures of memory and anxiety. In the brain, microglial activation was profoundly attenuated and amyloid-beta and tau were reduced via autophagy. Multi-kinase inhibition, including c-KIT, exerts multifunctional effects to reduce neurodegenerative pathology via autophagy and microglial activity and may represent a potential therapeutic option for neurodegeneration.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Mice, Transgenic; Mice; Disease Models, Animal; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit; Microglia; Autophagy; Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Brain; Mast Cells; tau Proteins; Plaque, Amyloid; Behavior, Animal; Male","Stevenson, M; Hebron, ML; Liu, X; Balaraman, K; Wolf, C; Moussa, C"
Reduced platelet activation and thrombus formation in male transgenic model mice of Alzheimer's disease suggests early sex-specific differences in platelet pathophysiology.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and characterized by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles and neurodegeneration. Over 80 % of AD patients also exhibit cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is a cerebrovascular disease caused by deposition of Aβ in the walls of cerebral blood vessels leading to vessel damage and impairment of normal blood flow. To date, different studies suggest that platelet function, including activation, adhesion and aggregation, is altered in AD due to vascular Aβ deposition. For example, the transgenic AD model mice APP23 mice that exhibit CAA and parenchymal Aβ plaques, show pre-activated platelets in the blood circulation and increased platelet integrin activation leading to a pro-thrombotic phenotype in these mice late stages of AD. However, it is still an open question whether or not platelets exhibit changes in their activation profile before they are exposed to vascular Aβ deposits. Therefore, the present study examined platelets from middle-aged transgenic APP23 mice at the age of 8-10 months. At this age, APP23 mice show amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma but not in the vasculature. Our analyses show that these APP23 mice have unaltered platelet numbers and size, and unaltered surface expression of glycoproteins. However, the number of dense granules in transgenic platelets was increased while the release was unaltered. Male, but not female APP23 mice, exhibited reduced platelet activation after stimulation of the thrombin receptor PAR4 and decreased thrombus stability on collagen under flow conditions ex vivo compared to control mice. In an arterial thrombosis model in vivo, male APP23 mice showed attenuated occlusion of the injured artery compared to controls. These findings provide clear evidence for early changes in platelet activation and thrombus formation in male mice before development of overt CAA. Furthermore, reduced platelet activation and thrombus formation suggest sex-specific differences in platelet physiology in AD that has to be considered in future studies of platelets and their role in AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Dense granules; Platelet activation; Platelets; Sex-related differences; thrombus formation,,"Donner, L; Krüger, I; Pfeiler, S; Gerdes, N; Schaller, M; Kelm, M; Elvers, M"
Platelets and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives.,"Platelets have a fundamental role in mediating hemostasis and thrombosis. However, more recently, a new idea is making headway, highlighting the importance of platelets as significant actors in modulating immune and inflammatory responses. In particular, platelets have an important role in the development of vascular amyloid-b-peptide(ab) deposits, known to play a relevant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through accumulation and deposition within the frontal cortex and hippocampus in the brain. The involvement of platelets in the pathogenesis of AD opens up the highly attractive possibility of applying antiplatelet therapy for the treatment and/or prevention of AD, but conclusive results are scarce. Even less is known about the potential role of platelets in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim to this brief review is to summarize current knowledge on this topic and to introduce the new perspectives on the possible role of platelet activation as therapeutic target both in AD and MCI.",2024,Alzheimer’s; amyloid; cognitive impairment; platelets,Humans; Blood Platelets; Alzheimer Disease; Platelet Activation; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors,"Gallo, A; Lipari, A; Di Francesco, S; Ianuà, E; Liperoti, R; Cipriani, MC; Martone, AM; De Candia, E; Landi, F; Montalto, M"

"Resveratrol in Neurodegeneration, in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and in the Redox Biology of the Mitochondria.","Neurodegeneration is a process leading to the progressive loss of structure and functions of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease have shown many common points at the subcellular level. Neurons are metabolically active cells and need a high amount of energy. Mitochondria are known as the energy synthesis center for cells, involved in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate by oxidative phosphorylation. Rather than just being an energy synthesis center, it has critical importance for many cellular functions such as calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, cell growth, and apoptosis. In the process of mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular functions are disrupted and cells enter the apoptotic or necrotic pathway. Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4-trihydoxystilbene), a plant-derived polyphenol found in the seed of grapes, berries, peanuts, and wine, has many biological effects such as inhibition of lipid peroxidation, scavenging of free radicals, changes in eicosanoid synthesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity, and regulation of lipid metabolism. Through the reviewed literature, the current study investigated the protective role of resveratrol in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies show that resveratrol moderates mitochondrial function, redox status, and cellular dynamics in both ",2023,,,"Danışman, B; Ercan Kelek, S; Aslan, M"
Elevated protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) gene expression in Alzheimer's disease predicts cognitive decline.,"Platelet activation of protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) and thrombin are at the top of a chain of events leading to fibrin deposition, microinfarcts, blood-brain barrier disruption, and inflammation. We evaluated mRNA expression of the PAR4 gene F2RL3 in human brain and global cognitive performance in participants with and without cognitive impairment or dementia. Data were acquired from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). F2RL3 mRNA was elevated in AD cases and was associated with worse retrospective longitudinal cognitive performance. Moreover, F2RL3 expression interacted with clinical AD diagnosis on longitudinal cognition whereas this relationship was attenuated in individuals without cognitive impairment. Additionally, when adjusting for the effects of AD neuropathology, F2RL3 expression remained a significant predictor of cognitive decline. F2RL3 expression correlated positively with transcript levels of proinflammatory markers including TNFα, IL-1β, NFκB, and fibrinogen α/β/γ. Together, these results reveal that F2RL3 mRNA expression is associated with multiple AD-relevant outcomes and its encoded product, PAR4, may play a role in disease pathogenesis.",2024,Cerebrovascular disease; Cytokines; Inflammation; PAR4; Thrombin,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Receptors, Thrombin; Male; Female; Aged, 80 and over; RNA, Messenger; Gene Expression; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Cognition; Inflammation; NF-kappa B; Interleukin-1beta; Fibrinogen; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Inflammation Mediators","Winfree, RL; Erreger, K; Phillips, J; Seto, M; Wang, Y; Schneider, JA; Bennett, DA; Schrag, MS; Hohman, TJ; Hamm, HE"
Integrating the patient's voice into the research agenda for treatment of chemosensory disorders.,"World-wide some 658 million people were infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and millions suffer from chemosensory impairment associated with long COVID. Current treatments for taste and smell disorders are limited. Involving patients has the potential to catalyze the dynamic exchange and development of new ideas and approaches to facilitate biomedical research and therapeutics. We assessed patients' perceptions of the efficacy of treatments for chemosensory impairment using an online questionnaire completed by 5,815 people in the US Logistic regression determined variables predictive of reported treatment efficacy for patients aged 18 to 24, 25 to 39, 40 to 60, and 60+ yrs. who were treated with nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, smell training, theophylline, platelet-rich plasma, and Omega 3. The most consistent predictor was age, with the majority of those 40 to 60 and 60+ reporting that nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, and smell training were only slightly effective or not effective at all. Many of these treatment strategies target regeneration and immune response, processes compromised by age. Only those under 40 reported more than slight efficacy of steroids or smell training. Findings emphasize the need to include patients of all ages in clinical trials. Older adults with olfactory impairment are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We speculate that olfactory impairment associated with long COVID introduces the potential for a significant rise in AD. Long COVID-associated chemosensory impairment increases the urgency for translational and clinical research on novel treatment strategies.

Hybrid Membrane-Coated Nanoparticles for Precise Targeting and Synergistic Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) limits the application of most therapeutic drugs for neurological diseases (NDs). Hybrid cell membrane-coated nanoparticles derived from different cell types can mimic the surface properties and functionalities of the source cells, further enhancing their targeting precision and therapeutic efficacy. Neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of various NDs, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, a novel cell membrane coating is designed by hybridizing the membrane from platelets and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) cells are overexpressed to cross the BBB and target neuroinflammatory lesions. Past unsuccessful endeavors in AD drug development underscore the challenge of achieving favorable outcomes when utilizing single-mechanism drugs.Two drugs with different mechanisms of actions into liposomes are successfully loaded to realize multitargeting treatment. In a transgenic mouse model for familial AD (5xFAD), the administration of these drug-loaded hybrid cell membrane liposomes results in a significant reduction in amyloid plaque deposition, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments. Collectively, the hybrid cell membrane-coated nanomaterials offer new opportunities for precise drug delivery and disease-specific targeting, which represent a versatile platform for targeted therapy in AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; hybrid cell membrane‐coated liposomes; inflammatory targeting; synergistic therapy,"Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Mice; Nanoparticles; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Transgenic; Blood-Brain Barrier; Liposomes; Drug Delivery Systems; Cell Membrane; Humans","Lin, RR; Jin, LL; Xue, YY; Zhang, ZS; Huang, HF; Chen, DF; Liu, Q; Mao, ZW; Wu, ZY; Tao, QQ"
Polar lipids modify Alzheimer's Disease pathology by reducing astrocyte pro-inflammatory signaling through platelet-activating factor receptor (PTAFR) modulation.,"Pro-inflammatory processes triggered by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides are a well-described pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activated astrocytes surrounding Aβ plaques contribute to inflammation by secreting proinflammatory factors. While astrocytes may phagocytize Aβ and contribute to Aβ clearance, reactive astrocytes may also increase Aβ production. Therefore, identifying factors that can attenuate astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation and how these factors influence pro-inflammatory pathways is important for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies in AD. Here, we identify the platelet-activating factor receptor (PTAFR) pathway as a key mediator of astrocyte activation. Intriguingly, several polar lipids (PLs) have exhibited anti-inflammatory protective properties outside the central nervous system through their inhibitory effect on the PTAFR pathway. Thus, we additionally investigated whether different PLs also exert inhibitory effects on the PAF pathway in astrocytes and whether their presence influences astrocytic pro-inflammatory signaling and known AD pathologies in vitro.",2024,Alzheimer's Disease; Astrocytes; Beta-amyloid; Glial cells; Neuroinflammation; Nutrition; Polar lipids,Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Astrocytes; Reactive Oxygen Species; Lipids,"Hans, S; Stanton, JE; Sauer, AK; Shiels, K; Saha, SK; Lordan, R; Tsoupras, A; Zabetakis, I; Grabrucker, AM"
Peripheral Blood Cells From Older Adults Exhibit Sex-Associated Differences in Mitochondrial Function.,"Blood-based mitochondrial bioenergetic profiling is a feasible, economical, and minimally invasive approach that can be used to examine mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in human subjects. In this study, we use 2 complementary respirometric techniques to evaluate mitochondrial bioenergetics in both intact and permeabilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and platelets to examine sex dimorphism in mitochondrial function among older adults. Employing equal numbers of PBMCs and platelets to assess mitochondrial bioenergetics, we observe significantly higher respiration rates in female compared to male participants. Mitochondrial bioenergetic differences remain significant after controlling for independent parameters including demographic parameters (age, years of education), and cognitive parameters (mPACC5, COGDX). Our study illustrates that circulating blood cells, immune cells in particular, have distinctly different mitochondrial bioenergetic profiles between females and males. These differences should be taken into account as blood-based bioenergetic profiling is now commonly used to understand the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in human health and aging.",2024,"Lymphocytes; Mitochondrial bioenergetics; Neutrophils, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells; Platelets; Sex differences","Humans; Male; Female; Mitochondria; Aged; Energy Metabolism; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Blood Platelets; Aging; Sex Factors; Sex Characteristics; Aged, 80 and over","Mahapatra, G; Gao, Z; Bateman, JR; Lockhart, SN; Bergstrom, J; Piloso, JE; Craft, S; Molina, AJA"

Inorganic polyphosphate: from basic research to diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in ALS/FTD.,"Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is a simple, negatively charged biopolymer with chain lengths ranging from just a few to over a thousand ortho-phosphate (Pi) residues. polyP is detected in every cell type across all organisms in nature thus far analyzed. Despite its structural simplicity, polyP has been shown to play important roles in a remarkably broad spectrum of biological processes, including blood coagulation, bone mineralization and inflammation. Furthermore, polyP has been implicated in brain function and the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this review, we first address the challenges associated with identifying mammalian polyP metabolizing enzymes, such as Nudt3, and quantifying polyP levels in brain tissue, cultured neural cells and cerebrospinal fluid. Subsequently, we focus on recent studies that unveil how the excessive release of polyP by human and mouse ALS/FTD astrocytes contributes to these devastating diseases by inducing hyperexcitability, leading to motoneuron death. Potential implications of elevated polyP levels in ALS/FTD patients for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are explored. It is emphasized, however, that caution is required in targeting polyP in the brain due to its diverse physiological functions, serving as an energy source, a chelator for divalent cations and a scaffold for amyloidogenic proteins. Reducing polyP levels, especially in neurons, might thus have adverse effects in brain functioning. Finally, we discuss how activated mast cells and platelets also can significantly contribute to ALS progression, as they can massively release polyP.",2024,ALS; Nudt3; astrocytes; channels; motoneurons; polyP,Animals; Mice; Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Polyphosphates; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Mammals,"Garcés, P; Amaro, A; Montecino, M; van Zundert, B"

Immunothrombosis in neurovascular disease.,"A State of the Art lecture titled ""Immunothrombosis in Neurovascular Diseases"" was presented at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Congress in 2023. Despite significant clinical advancements in stroke therapy, stroke remains a prominent contributor to both mortality and disability worldwide. Brain injury resulting from an ischemic stroke is a dynamic process that unfolds over time. Initially, an infarct core forms due to the abrupt and substantial blockage of blood flow. In the subsequent hours to days, the surrounding tissue undergoes gradual deterioration, primarily driven by sustained hypoperfusion, programmed cell death, and inflammation. While anti-inflammatory strategies have proven highly effective in experimental models of stroke, their successful translation to clinical use has proven challenging. To overcome this translational hurdle, a better understanding of the distinct immune response driving ischemic stroke brain injury is needed. In this review article, we give an overview of current knowledge regarding the immune response in ischemic stroke and the contribution of immunothrombosis to this process. We discuss therapeutic approaches to overcome detrimental immunothrombosis in ischemic stroke and how these can be extrapolated to other neurovascular diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.

"Potential links between platelets and amyloid-β in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: Evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies.","Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a prevalent comorbidity among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), present in up to 80% of cases with varying levels of severity. There is evidence to suggest that CAA might intensify cognitive deterioration in AD patients, thereby accelerating the development of AD pathology. As a source of amyloids, it has been postulated that platelets play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both AD and CAA. Although several studies have demonstrated that platelet activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD and CAA, a clear understanding of the mechanisms involved in the three steps: platelet activation, platelet adhesion, and platelet aggregation in AD pathogenesis still remains elusive. Moreover, potential therapeutic targets in platelet-mediated AD pathogenesis have not been explicitly addressed. Therefore, the aim of this review is to collate and discuss the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence related to platelet dysfunction, including associated activation, adhesion, and aggregation, with specific reference to amyloid-related AD pathogenesis. Potential therapeutic targets of platelet-mediated AD pathogenesis are also discussed.

Peripheral blood amyloid-β involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via impacting on peripheral innate immune cells.,"A key pathological factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of age-related dementia in the world, is excessive β-amyloid protein (Aβ) in extracellular aggregation in the brain. And in the peripheral blood, a large amount of Aβ is derived from platelets. So far, the causality between the levels of peripheral blood Aβ and its aggregation in the brain, particularly the role of the peripheral blood Aβ in the pathology of AD, is still unclear. And the relation between the peripheral blood Aβ and tau tangles of brain, another crucial pathologic factor contributing to the pathogenesis of AD, is also ambiguous. More recently, the anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies are approved for treatment of AD patients through declining the peripheral blood Aβ mechanism of action to enhance plasma and central nervous system (CNS) Aβ clearance, leading to a decrease Aβ burden in brain and improving cognitive function, which clearly indicates that the levels of the peripheral blood Aβ impacted on the Aβ burden in brain and involved in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, the role of peripheral innate immune cells in AD remains mostly unknown and the results obtained were controversial.

Integrated omics analysis of coronary artery calcifications and myocardial infarction: the Framingham Heart Study.,"Gene function can be described using various measures. We integrated association studies of three types of omics data to provide insights into the pathophysiology of subclinical coronary disease and myocardial infarction (MI). Using multivariable regression models, we associated: (1) single nucleotide polymorphism, (2) DNA methylation, and (3) gene expression with coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores and MI. Among 3106 participants of the Framingham Heart Study, 65 (2.1%) had prevalent MI and 60 (1.9%) had incident MI, median CAC value was 67.8 [IQR 10.8, 274.9], and 1403 (45.2%) had CAC scores > 0 (prevalent CAC). Prevalent CAC was associated with AHRR (linked to smoking) and EXOC3 (affecting platelet function and promoting hemostasis). CAC score was associated with VWA1 (extracellular matrix protein associated with cartilage structure in endomysium). For prevalent MI we identified FYTTD1 (down-regulated in familial hypercholesterolemia) and PINK1 (linked to cardiac tissue homeostasis and ischemia-reperfusion injury). Incident MI was associated with IRX3 (enhancing browning of white adipose tissue) and STXBP3 (controlling trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 to plasma). Using an integrative trans-omics approach, we identified both putatively novel and known candidate genes associated with CAC and MI.

"CSF, Blood, and MRI Biomarkers in Skogholt's Disease-A Rare Neurodegenerative Disease in a Norwegian Kindred.","Skogholt's disease is a rare neurological disorder that is only observed in a small Norwegian kindred. It typically manifests in adulthood with uncharacteristic neurological symptoms from both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The etiology of the observed cerebral white matter lesions and peripheral myelin pathology is unclear. Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of protein have been confirmed, and recently, very high concentrations of CSF total and phosphorylated tau have been detected in Skogholt patients. The symptoms and observed biomarker changes in Skogholt's disease are largely nonspecific, and further studies are necessary to elucidate the disease mechanisms.

Glutamate Receptor Dysregulation and Platelet Glutamate Dynamics in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases: Insights into Current Medications.,"Two of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), present significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. While the etiologies of AD and PD differ, both diseases share commonalities in synaptic dysfunction, thereby focusing attention on the role of neurotransmitters. The possible functions that platelets may play in neurodegenerative illnesses including PD and AD are becoming more acknowledged. In AD, platelets have been investigated for their ability to generate amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides, contributing to the formation of neurotoxic plaques. Moreover, platelets are considered biomarkers for early AD diagnosis. In PD, platelets have been studied for their involvement in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are key factors in the disease's pathogenesis. Emerging research shows that platelets, which release glutamate upon activation, also play a role in these disorders. Decreased glutamate uptake in platelets has been observed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients, pointing to a systemic dysfunction in glutamate handling. This paper aims to elucidate the critical role that glutamate receptors play in the pathophysiology of both AD and PD. Utilizing data from clinical trials, animal models, and cellular studies, we reviewed how glutamate receptors dysfunction contributes to neurodegenerative (ND) processes such as excitotoxicity, synaptic loss, and cognitive impairment. The paper also reviews all current medications including glutamate receptor antagonists for AD and PD, highlighting their mode of action and limitations. A deeper understanding of glutamate receptor involvement including its systemic regulation by platelets could open new avenues for more effective treatments, potentially slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes.",2023,AMPA receptor; Alzheimer’s disease; NMDA receptor; Parkinson’s disease; glutamate; kainate receptor; metabotropic glutamate receptor; platelet,"Animals; Humans; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Glutamic Acid; Receptors, Glutamate","Gautam, D; Naik, UP; Naik, MU; Yadav, SK; Chaurasia, RN; Dash, D"
Causal relationship between psoriasis vulgaris and dementia: Insights from Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Many clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between psoriasis vulgaris and dementia, yet this correlation remains controversial. Our study employed the Mendelian randomization (MR) method to investigate the causal relationship between psoriasis vulgaris and dementia. Data were obtained from the summary statistics of the genome-wide association studies from IEU-OpenGWAS project database. In univariate Mendelian randomization (UVMR) analysis, psoriasis vulgaris was used as exposure. Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) served as the outcomes. In multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analysis, VaD served as the outcome. The first MVMR analysis used psoriasis vulgaris, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet count (PLT) as exposures. The second MVMR analysis used psoriasis vulgaris, vitamin D level and 25 hydroxyvitamin D level as exposures. The main analysis employed the inverse variance weighted method, and the outcomes were evaluated by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). In UVMR analysis, the results depicted that psoriasis vulgaris was associated with VaD (OR: 0.903, 95% CI: 0.818-0.996, p = 0.041). The results revealed insignificant associations between psoriasis vulgaris and other dementia types. After adjusting the effects of MPV, PDW and PLT in MVMR analysis, the association between psoriasis vulgaris and VaD was no longer significant (p = 0.164). Similarly, after adjusting the effects of vitamin D level and 25 hydroxyvitamin D level in MVMR analysis, the association between psoriasis vulgaris and VaD was also no longer significant (p = 0.533). Our study suggests that psoriasis vulgaris may potentially decrease VaD incidence. However, the causal association between psoriasis vulgaris and VaD may be impeded by platelet-related indices, vitamin D level and 25 hydroxyvitamin D level.",2024,causal relationship; dementia; mendelian randomization; psoriasis vulgaris; vascular dementia,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Psoriasis; Calcifediol; Vitamin D; Dementia,"Zhang, Z; Xu, W; Zheng, Y; Chen, C; Kang, X; Chen, D; Cheng, F; Wang, X"

Chronic kidney disease causes blood-brain barrier breakdown via urea-activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 and insolubility of tau protein.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes cognitive impairment and contributes to the overall global burden of dementia. However, mechanisms through which the kidneys and brain communicate are not fully understood. We established a CKD mouse model through adenine-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Novel object recognition tests indicated that CKD decreased recognition memory. Sarkosyl-insoluble-proteomic analyses of the CKD mouse hippocampus revealed an accumulation of insoluble MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) and RNA-binding proteins such as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1 subunit 70 (SNRNP70). Additionally, there was an accumulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. We identified that expressions of essential tight-junction protein claudin-5 and adherens-junction protein platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) were decreased in the brain endothelial cells of CKD mice. We determined urea as a major uremic solute that dose dependently decreased both claudin-5 and PECAM-1 expression in the mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 cells. Gelatin zymography indicated that the serum of CKD mice activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), while marimastat ameliorated the reduction of claudin-5 expression by urea in bEnd.3 cells. This study established a brain proteomic signature of CKD indicating BBB breakdown and insolubility of tau protein, which are pathologically linked to Alzheimer's disease. Urea-mediated activation of MMP2 was partly responsible for BBB breakdown in CKD.",2023,blood brain barrier; chronic kidney disease; cognitive impairment; proteomics; urea,"Animals; Mice; Blood-Brain Barrier; Claudin-5; Endothelial Cells; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Proteomics; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; tau Proteins","Matsuki, H; Mandai, S; Shiwaku, H; Koide, T; Takahashi, N; Yanagi, T; Inaba, S; Ida, S; Fujiki, T; Mori, Y; Ando, F; Mori, T; Susa, K; Iimori, S; Sohara, E; Takahashi, H; Uchida, S"

"Gut Microbiome and Circadian Interactions with Platelets Across Human Diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Cancer.","Platelets have traditionally been investigated for their role in clot formation in the course of cardiovascular diseases and strokes. However, recent work indicates platelets to be an integral aspect of wider systemic processes, with relevance to the pathophysiology of a host of diverse medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. This article reviews platelet function and interactions with the gut microbiome and circadian systems, highlighting the role of the platelet mitochondrial melatonergic pathway in determining platelet activation, fluxes and plasticity. This provides a number of novel conceptualizations of platelet function and mode of interaction with other cell types, including in the pathoetiology and pathophysiology of diverse medical conditions, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is proposed that a platelet-gut axis allows platelets to contribute to many of the pathophysiological processes linked to gut dysbiosis and gut permeability. This is at least partly via platelet sphingosine- 1-phosphate release, which regulates enteric glial cells and lymphocyte chemotaxis, indicating an etiological role for platelets in a wide array of medical conditions linked to alterations in the gut microbiome. Platelets are also an important regulator of the various microenvironments that underpin most human medical conditions, including the tumor microenvironment, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Platelet serotonin release regulates the availability of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway systemically, thereby being an important determinant of the dynamic metabolic interactions occurring across cell types that underpin the pathoetiology of many medical conditions. In addition, a number of novel and diverse future research directions and treatment implications are proposed.",2023,Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Cancer; Circadian; Gut microbiome; Melatonin; Mitochondria; N-acetylserotonin; Neurodegeneration; PLAU.; Platelets,Humans; Melatonin; Alzheimer Disease; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment,"Anderson, G"

Intrathecal autologous thrombin-activated condensed platelet cytokines in chronic neurodegenerative disease: A hypothesis for anti-inflammatory and regenerative response.,"Choroid plexus insufficiency or glymphatic stasis are often classified as prequels to harmful accretion of toxic proteins in neurodegenerative disease. Cognitive decline and disordered neuronal signaling subsequently become cardinal features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), typically progressing with amyloid-ß and tau protein accumulation. For Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein deposits and dopamine depletion are linked to impaired movement, resting tremor, and rigidity. Importantly, both diagnoses feature hyperinflammation and intrathecal cytokine changes. Thus far, numerous clinical trials have produced nothing effective for AD or PD, yet the anti-inflammatory and regenerative potential of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) remains largely unexamined in this context. Our report explores a proposed Phase I study on intrathecal condensed plasma growth factors processed from thrombin-activated PRP as monotherapy for AD or PD. The concept gains support from related work where cytokines of platelet origin successfully lowered inflammation, corrected background fibrosis, deactivated abnormal cells, and recovered local tissue function-all desirable outcomes in AD and PD. While PRP-mediated effects on membrane potentials, cellular signaling, electrolyte balance, and water clearance are less well characterized, experimental data suggest these pathways could likewise influence glymphatic drainage to ameliorate proteinopathies. As a well-tolerated 'orthobiologic' with no hypersensitivity risk, intrathecal PRP and its derivatives bring advantages over synthetic pharmaceuticals. If age-associated neuroinflammation in AD and PD is an upstream event inciting or contributing to neural disruption, then dampening local oxidative stress by a patient's own platelet cytokines (successful in other contexts) could offer therapeutic relevance to these neurodegenerative conditions as well.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Chronic Disease; Cytokines; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Thrombin; Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic","Sills, ES; Chu, HI; Wang, JW; Wood, SH; Tan, SL"
"Morphometric and Nanomechanical Screening of Peripheral Blood Cells with Atomic Force Microscopy for Label-Free Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.","Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are complex, multifactorial disorders with significant social and economic impact in today's society. NDDs are predicted to become the second-most common cause of death in the next few decades due to an increase in life expectancy but also to a lack of early diagnosis and mainly symptomatic treatment. Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic methods, there are yet no reliable biomarkers identifying the complex pathways contributing to these pathologies. The development of new approaches for early diagnosis and new therapies, together with the identification of non-invasive and more cost-effective diagnostic biomarkers, is one of the main trends in NDD biomedical research. Here we summarize data on peripheral biomarkers, biofluids (cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma), and peripheral blood cells (platelets (PLTs) and red blood cells (RBCs)), reported so far for the three most common NDDs-Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PLTs and RBCs, beyond their primary physiological functions, are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of biomarkers for NDDs. Special attention is given to the morphological and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and RBCs as biophysical markers for the three pathologies. Modifications of the surface nanostructure and morphometric and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and RBCs from patients with AD, PD, and ALS have been revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is currently experiencing rapid and widespread adoption in biomedicine and clinical medicine, in particular for early diagnostics of various medical conditions. AFM is a unique instrument without an analog, allowing the generation of three-dimensional cell images with extremely high spatial resolution at near-atomic scale, which are complemented by insights into the mechanical properties of cells and subcellular structures. Data demonstrate that AFM can distinguish between the three pathologies and the normal, healthy state. The specific PLT and RBC signatures can serve as biomarkers in combination with the currently used diagnostic tools. We highlight the strong correlation of the morphological and nanomechanical signatures between RBCs and PLTs in PD, ALS, and AD.",2023,atomic force microscopy; biomarkers; cell morphology; cell nanomechanics; neurodegenerative disorders; platelets; red blood cells,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Alzheimer Disease; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Blood Cells","Taneva, SG; Todinova, S; Andreeva, T"

Regulation of mitochondrial function by hydroquinone derivatives as prevention of platelet activation.,"Platelet activation plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in different diseases (e.g., cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular diseases, and even in patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019). Therefore, antiplatelet therapy is essential to reduce thrombus formation. However, the utility of current antiplatelet drugs is limited. Therefore, identifying novel antiplatelet compounds is very important in developing new drugs. In this context, the involvement of mitochondrial function as an efficient energy source required for platelet activation is currently accepted; however, its contribution as an antiplatelet target still has little been exploited. Regarding this, the intramolecular hydrogen bonding of hydroquinone derivatives has been described as a structural motif that allows the reach of small molecules at mitochondria, which can exert antiplatelet activity, among others. In this review, we describe the role of mitochondrial function in platelet activation and how hydroquinone derivatives exert antiplatelet activity through mitochondrial regulation.",2023,Antiplatelet; Hydroquinone; Mitochondria; Platelet; Small molecules,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Hydroquinones; COVID-19; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Platelet Activation; Mitochondria; Thrombosis; Blood Platelets","Fuentes, E; Arauna, D; Araya-Maturana, R"
Acute Myocardial Infarction and Risk of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia: A Review.,"Cognitive impairment (CI) shares common cardiovascular risk factors with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is increasingly prevalent in our ageing population. Whilst AMI is associated with increased rates of CI, CI remains underreported and infrequently identified in patients with AMI. In this review, we discuss the evidence surrounding AMI and its links to dementia and CI, including pathophysiology, risk factors, management and interventions. Vascular dysregulation plays a major role in CI, with atherosclerosis, platelet activation, microinfarcts and perivascular inflammation resulting in neurovascular unit dysfunction, disordered homeostasis and a dysfunctional neurohormonal response. This subsequently affects perfusion pressure, resulting in enlarged periventricular spaces and hippocampal sclerosis. The increased platelet activation seen in coronary artery disease (CAD) can also result in inflammation and amyloid-β protein deposition which is associated with Alzheimer's Dementia. Post-AMI, reduced blood pressure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction can cause chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, cerebral infarction and failure of normal circulatory autoregulatory mechanisms. Patients who undergo coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or bypass surgery) are at increased risk for post-procedure cognitive impairment, though whether this is related to the intervention itself or underlying cardiovascular risk factors is debated. Mortality rates are higher in dementia patients with AMI, and post-AMI CI is more prevalent in the elderly and in patients with post-AMI heart failure. Medical management (antiplatelet, statin, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, cardiac rehabilitation) can reduce the risk of post-AMI CI; however, beta-blockers may be associated with functional decline in patients with existing CI. The early identification of those with dementia or CI who present with AMI is important, as subsequent tailoring of management strategies can potentially improve outcomes as well as guide prognosis.",2023,acute coronary syndrome; acute myocardial infarction; cognitive impairment; coronary artery bypass surgery; coronary artery disease; dementia; heart failure; percutaneous coronary intervention,,"Thong, EHE; Quek, EJW; Loo, JH; Yun, CY; Teo, YN; Teo, YH; Leow, AST; Li, TYW; Sharma, VK; Tan, BYQ; Yeo, LLL; Chong, YF; Chan, MY; Sia, CH"
Mitochondrial genome study in blood of maternally inherited ALS cases.,"ALS is a heterogeneous disease in which different factors such as mitochondrial phenotypes act in combination with a genetic predisposition.

Neutrophils and platelets have crucial synergistic roles in thromboinflammation and are increasingly suspected as effector cells contributing to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases. In this review, we summarize the roles of platelet-neutrophil interactions in triggering complex pathophysiological events affecting the brain that may lead to the disruption of brain barriers, infiltration of toxic factors into the parenchyma, and amplification of neuroinflammation through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We highlight the clinical significance of thromboinflammation in neurological disorders and examine the contributions of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) derived from platelets and neutrophils. These DAMPs originate from both infectious and non-infectious risk factors and contribute to the activation of inflammasomes during brain disorders.

Post-Ischemic Permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier to Amyloid and Platelets as a Factor in the Maturation of Alzheimer's Disease-Type Brain Neurodegeneration.,"The aim of this review is to present evidence of the impact of ischemic changes in the blood-brain barrier on the maturation of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration with features of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the processes involved in the permeability of the post-ischemic blood-brain barrier during recirculation will provide clinically relevant knowledge regarding the neuropathological changes that ultimately lead to dementia of the Alzheimer's disease type. In this review, we try to distinguish between primary and secondary neuropathological processes during and after ischemia. Therefore, we can observe two hit stages that contribute to Alzheimer's disease development. The onset of ischemic brain pathology includes primary ischemic neuronal damage and death followed by the ischemic injury of the blood-brain barrier with serum leakage of amyloid into the brain tissue, leading to increased ischemic neuronal susceptibility to amyloid neurotoxicity, culminating in the formation of amyloid plaques and ending in full-blown dementia of the Alzheimer's disease type.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; amyloid plaques; astrocytes; blood–brain barrier; brain ischemia; microbleeding; neurodegeneration; neurofibrillary tangle; pericytes; platelets; tau protein,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Blood Platelets; Brain; Ischemia; Amyloid; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Pluta, R; Miziak, B; Czuczwar, SJ"

Despite significant research efforts to understand the late stages of the disease, its etiology remains largely unknown. This is in part because of the imprecise AD models in current use. In addition, little attention has been paid to neural stem cells (NSC), which are the cells responsible for the development and maintenance of brain tissue during an individual's lifespan. Thus, an in vitro 3D human brain tissue model using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neural cells in human physiological conditions may be an excellent alternative to standard models to investigate AD pathology. Following the differentiation process mimicking development, iPS cells can be turned into NSCs and, ultimately, neural cells. During differentiation, the traditionally used xenogeneic products may alter the cells' physiology and prevent accurate disease pathology modeling. Hence, establishing a xenogeneic material-free cell culture and differentiation protocol is essential. This study investigated the differentiation of iPS cells to neural cells using a novel extracellular matrix derived from human platelet lysates (PL Matrix). We compared the stemness properties and differentiation efficacies of iPS cells in a PL matrix against those in a conventional 3D scaffold made of an oncogenic murine-matrix. Using well-defined conditions without xenogeneic material, we successfully expanded and differentiated iPS cells into NSCs via dual-SMAD inhibition, which regulates the BMP and TGF signaling cascades in a manner closer to human conditions. This in vitro, 3D, xenogeneic-free scaffold will enhance the quality of disease modeling for neurodegenerative disease research, and the knowledge produced could be used in developing more effective translational medicine.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; extracellular matrix; iPS cells; neural stem cells; neurulation; platelets,,"Valerio, LSA; Carrick, FR; Bedoya, L; Sreerama, S; Sugaya, K"
Reelin through the years: From brain development to inflammation.,"Reelin was originally identified as a regulator of neuronal migration and synaptic function, but its non-neuronal functions have received far less attention. Reelin participates in organ development and physiological functions in various tissues, but it is also dysregulated in some diseases. In the cardiovascular system, Reelin is abundant in the blood, where it contributes to platelet adhesion and coagulation, as well as vascular adhesion and permeability of leukocytes. It is a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic factor with important implications for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, or cancer. Mechanistically, Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that binds to several membrane receptors, including ApoER2, VLDLR, integrins, and ephrins. Reelin signaling depends on the cell type but mostly involves phosphorylation of NF-κB, PI3K, AKT, or JAK/STAT. This review focuses on non-neuronal functions and the therapeutic potential of Reelin, while highlighting secretion, signaling, and functional similarities between cell types.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; ApoER2; CP: Cancer; CP: Immunology; JAK/STAT; NF-κB; PI3K/AKT; Reelin; VLDR; arthritis; atherosclerosis; cancer; coagulation; immune system; inflammation; intestine; kidney; leukocyte; liver; lymphatic circulation; multiple sclerosis; vascular system,"Humans; Brain; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Inflammation; LDL-Receptor Related Proteins; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Receptors, LDL; Serine Endopeptidases; Reelin Protein","Alexander, A; Herz, J; Calvier, L"
Myeloid cells in vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease: Possible therapeutic targets?,"Growing evidence supports the suggestion that the peripheral immune system plays a role in different pathologies associated with cognitive impairment, such as vascular dementia (VD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this review is to summarize, within the peripheral immune system, the implications of different types of myeloid cells in AD and VD, with a special focus on post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID). We will review the contributions of the myeloid lineage, from peripheral cells (neutrophils, platelets, monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages) to central nervous system (CNS)-associated cells (perivascular macrophages and microglia). Finally, we will evaluate different potential strategies for pharmacological modulation of pathological processes mediated by myeloid cell subsets, with an emphasis on neutrophils, their interaction with platelets and the process of immunothrombosis that triggers neutrophil-dependent capillary stall and hypoperfusion, as possible effector mechanisms that may pave the way to novel therapeutic avenues to stop dementia, the epidemic of our time.

How can platelet proteomics best be used to interrogate disease?,"Various modifications of proteins and the resulting proteoforms of a protein can associate with many diseases and are also significantly involved in the rapid regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. For example, the release of prostacyclin from the intact endothelium and the consequent following phosphorylation of VASP in platelets is a post-translational regulation to keep them in a quiescent state. In Alzheimer's disease, proteoforms arise from the altered cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, which finally causes amyloid plaques in the brain. This changed processing of the amyloid precursor protein can also be detected in platelets, making them an attractive source of biomarkers for this neurodegenerative disease. Age-related or prothrombotic disorders can have multiple origins, including genomic, transcriptional, and translational factors, which together can be mapped at the proteome level. Hence, recording these dynamic protein changes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions is paramount in platelet proteomics. To effectively study diseases through platelet proteomics, it is crucial to consider platelets' primary regulatory mechanism and thoroughly evaluate the disparities between the two leading proteomics technologies, top-down and bottom-up approaches. This commentary provides insights into the differences between these two technologies, which are particularly noticeable in detecting the different proteoforms of a protein.",2023,,"Humans; Proteomics; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Blood Platelets; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteome","Zellner, M"

A peripheral signature of Alzheimer's disease featuring microbiota-gut-brain axis markers.,Increasing evidence links the gut microbiota (GM) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the mechanisms through which gut bacteria influence the brain are still unclear.

Multifunctional magnetoliposomes as drug delivery vehicles for the potential treatment of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, development of novel technologies and strategies to treat PD is a global health priority. Current treatments include administration of Levodopa, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, and anticholinergic drugs. However, the effective release of these molecules, due to the limited bioavailability, is a major challenge for the treatment of PD. As a strategy to solve this challenge, in this study we developed a novel multifunctional magnetic and redox-stimuli responsive drug delivery system, based on the magnetite nanoparticles functionalized with the high-performance translocating protein OmpA and encapsulated into soy lecithin liposomes. The obtained multifunctional magnetoliposomes (MLPs) were tested in neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, primary human and rat astrocytes, blood brain barrier rat endothelial cells, primary mouse microvascular endothelial cells, and in a PD-induced cellular model. MLPs demonstrated excellent performance in biocompatibility assays, including hemocompatibility (hemolysis percentages below 1%), platelet aggregation, cytocompatibility (cell viability above 80% in all tested cell lines), mitochondrial membrane potential (non-observed alterations) and intracellular ROS production (negligible impact compared to controls). Additionally, the nanovehicles showed acceptable cell internalization (covered area close to 100% at 30 min and 4 h) and endosomal escape abilities (significant decrease in lysosomal colocalization after 4 h of exposure). Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to better understand the underlying translocating mechanism of the OmpA protein, showing key findings regarding specific interactions with phospholipids.

Antiplatelet drugs: Potential therapeutic options for the management of neurodegenerative diseases.,"The blood platelet plays an important role but often remains under-recognized in several vascular complications and associated diseases. Surprisingly, platelet hyperactivity and hyperaggregability have often been considered the critical risk factors for developing vascular dysfunctions in several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. In addition, platelet structural and functional impairments promote prothrombotic and proinflammatory environment that can aggravate the progression of several NDDs. These findings provide the rationale for using antiplatelet agents not only to prevent morbidity but also to reduce mortality caused by NDDs. Therefore, we thoroughly review the evidence supporting the potential pleiotropic effects of several novel classes of synthetic antiplatelet drugs, that is, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists, protease-activated receptor blockers, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in NDDs. Apart from this, the review also emphasizes the recent developments of selected natural antiplatelet phytochemicals belonging to key classes of plant-based bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids as potential therapeutic candidates in NDDs. We believe that the broad analysis of contemporary strategies and specific approaches for plausible therapeutic treatment for NDDs presented in this review could be helpful for further successful research in this area.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's disease; Parkinson's disease; antiplatelet drugs; multiple sclerosis; natural phytochemicals,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Huntington Disease,"Beura, SK; Dhapola, R; Panigrahi, AR; Yadav, P; Kumar, R; Reddy, DH; Singh, SK"

CD31 as a probable responding and gate-keeping protein of the blood-brain barrier and the risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Several studies have shown that an abnormal vascular-immunity link could increase Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk; however, the mechanism is unclear. CD31, also named platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), is a surface membrane protein of both endothelial and immune cells and plays important roles in the interaction between the vascular and immune systems. In this review, we focus on research regarding CD31 biological actions in the pathological process that may contribute to AD based on the following rationales. First, endothelial, leukocyte and soluble forms of CD31 play multi-roles in regulating transendothelial migration, increasing blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and resulting in neuroinflammation. Second, CD31 expressed by endothelial and immune cells dynamically modulates numbers of signaling pathways, including Src family kinases, selected G proteins, and β-catenin which in turn affect cell-matrix and cell-cell attachment, activation, permeability, survival, and ultimately neuronal cell injury. In endothelia and immune cells, these diverse CD31-mediated pathways act as a critical regulator in the immunity-endothelia-brain axis, thereby mediating AD pathogenesis in ApoE4 carriers, which is the major genetic risk factor for AD. This evidence suggests a novel mechanism and potential drug target for CD31 in the background of genetic vulnerabilities and peripheral inflammation for AD development and progression.",2023,Alzheimer's disease (AD); CD31; blood–brain barrier (BBB); neuroinflammation; trans-endothelia,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Signal Transduction; Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration,"Zhang, Z; Gan, Q; Han, J; Tao, Q; Qiu, WQ; Madri, JA"
"Genetic Networks of Alzheimer's Disease, Aging, and Longevity in Humans.","Human genomic analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genes that are risk factors for early and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD genes). Although the genetics of aging and longevity have been extensively studied, previous studies have focused on a specific set of genes that have been shown to contribute to or are a risk factor for AD. Thus, the connections among the genes involved in AD, aging, and longevity are not well understood. Here, we identified the genetic interaction networks (referred to as pathways) of aging and longevity within the context of AD by using a gene set enrichment analysis by Reactome that cross-references more than 100 bioinformatic databases to allow interpretation of the biological functions of gene sets through a wide variety of gene networks.

"Decreased functional connectivity is associated with increased levels of Cerebral Spinal Fluid soluble-PDGFRβ, a marker of blood brain barrier breakdown, in older adults.","Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is suggested to be cross-sectionally associated with both vascular burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. For instance, studies in pre-clinical AD subjects have shown increases of cerebral spinal fluid soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (CSF sPDGFRβ, a marker of BBB breakdown) but have not demonstrated if this vascular impairment affects neuronal dysfunction. It's possible that increased levels of sPDGFRβ in the CSF may correlate with impaired FC in metabolically demanding brain regions (i.e. Default Mode Network, DMN). Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between these two markers in older individuals that were cognitively normal and had cognitive impairment. Eighty-nine older adults without dementia from the University of Southern California were selected from a larger cohort. Region of interest (ROI) to ROI analyses were conducted using DMN seed regions. Linear regression models measured significant associations between BOLD FC strength among seed-target regions and sPDGFRβ values, while covarying for age and sex. Comparison of a composite ROI created by averaging FC values between seed and all target regions among cognitively normal and impaired individuals was also examined. Using CSF sPDGFRβ as a biomarker of BBB breakdown, we report that increased breakdown correlated with decreased functional connectivity in DMN areas, specifically the PCC while the hippocampus exhibited an interaction effect using CDR score. We conclude that BBB breakdown as measured by CSF sPDGFRβ affects neural networks resulting in decreased functional connections that leads to cognitive dysfunction.",2023,BBB breakdown; cognitive impairment; default mode network (DMN); resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI); soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (sPDGFRβ),,"Contreras, JA; Fujisaki, K; Ortega, N; Barisano, G; Sagare, A; Pappas, I; Chui, H; Ringman, JM; Joe, EB; Zlokovic, B; Toga, AW; Pa, J"

The Yin and Yang Effect of the Apelinergic System in Oxidative Stress.,"Apelin is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor APJ and has multiple biological activities in human tissues and organs, including the heart, blood vessels, adipose tissue, central nervous system, lungs, kidneys, and liver. This article reviews the crucial role of apelin in regulating oxidative stress-related processes by promoting prooxidant or antioxidant mechanisms. Following the binding of APJ to different active apelin isoforms and the interaction with several G proteins according to cell types, the apelin/APJ system is able to modulate different intracellular signaling pathways and biological functions, such as vascular tone, platelet aggregation and leukocytes adhesion, myocardial activity, ischemia/reperfusion injury, insulin resistance, inflammation, and cell proliferation and invasion. As a consequence of these multifaceted properties, the role of the apelinergic axis in the pathogenesis of degenerative and proliferative conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, osteoporosis, and cancer) is currently investigated. In this view, the dual effect of the apelin/APJ system in the regulation of oxidative stress needs to be more extensively clarified, in order to identify new potential strategies and tools able to selectively modulate this axis according to the tissue-specific profile.",2023,APJ; apelin; apelinergic system; oxidative stress,"Humans; Apelin; Apelin Receptors; Oxidative Stress; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled","Fibbi, B; Marroncini, G; Naldi, L; Peri, A"

Stroke and Vascular Cognitive Impairment: The Role of Intestinal Microbiota Metabolite TMAO.,"The gut microbiome interacts with the brain bidirectionally through the microbiome-gutbrain axis, which plays a key role in regulating various nervous system pathophysiological processes. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is produced by choline metabolism through intestinal microorganisms, which can cross the blood-brain barrier to act on the central nervous system. Previous studies have shown that elevated plasma TMAO concentrations increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but there are few studies on TMAO in cerebrovascular disease and vascular cognitive impairment. This review summarized a decade of research on the impact of TMAO on stroke and related cognitive impairment, with particular attention to the effects on vascular cognitive disorders. We demonstrated that TMAO has a marked impact on the occurrence, development, and prognosis of stroke by regulating cholesterol metabolism, foam cell formation, platelet hyperresponsiveness and thrombosis, and promoting inflammation and oxidative stress. TMAO can also influence the cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease via inducing abnormal aggregation of key proteins, affecting inflammation and thrombosis. However, although clinical studies have confirmed the association between the microbiome-gut-brain axis and vascular cognitive impairment (cerebral small vessel disease and post-stroke cognitive impairment), the molecular mechanism of TMAO has not been clarified, and TMAO precursors seem to play the opposite role in the process of poststroke cognitive impairment. In addition, several studies have also reported the possible neuroprotective effects of TMAO. Existing therapies for these diseases targeted to regulate intestinal flora and its metabolites have shown good efficacy. TMAO is probably a new target for early prediction and treatment of stroke and vascular cognitive impairment.",2024,Gut microbiome; TMAO; dementia; post-stroke cognitive impairment; stroke; vascular cognitive impairment,Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Stroke; Inflammation; Cognitive Dysfunction; Thrombosis; Choline,"Tu, R; Xia, J"

Immune-mediated platelet depletion augments Alzheimer's disease neuropathological hallmarks in APP-PS1 mice.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), platelets become dysfunctional and might contribute to amyloid beta deposition. Here, we depleted platelets in one-year-old APP Swedish PS1 dE9 (APP-PS1) transgenic mice for five days, using intraperitoneal injections of an anti-CD42b antibody, and assessed changes in cerebral amyloidosis, plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy and gliosis. In APP-PS1 female mice, platelet depletion shifted amyloid plaque size distribution towards bigger plaques and increased neuritic dystrophy in the hippocampus. In platelet-depleted females, plaque-associated Iba1+ microglia had lower amounts of fibrillar amyloid beta cargo and GFAP+ astrocytic processes showed a higher overlap with thioflavin S+ amyloid plaques. In contrast to the popular hypothesis that platelets foster plaque pathology, our data suggest that platelets might limit plaque growth and attenuate plaque-related neuritic dystrophy at advanced stages of amyloid plaque pathology in APP-PS1 female mice. Whether the changes in amyloid plaque pathology are due to a direct effect on amyloid beta deposition or are a consequence of altered glial function needs to be further elucidated.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-beta; astrocytes; microglia; platelets,"Mice; Female; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Plaque, Amyloid; Mice, Transgenic; Disease Models, Animal","de Sousa, DMB; Benedetti, A; Altendorfer, B; Mrowetz, H; Unger, MS; Schallmoser, K; Aigner, L; Kniewallner, KM"

Identification of Plasma Proteomic Biomarkers in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Plasma proteomic profiling may provide novel biomarkers for the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The early diagnosis of MCI still remains a challenging task due to its diverse origin. Currently, molecular approaches have been used to identify MCI diversified origin as its onset is governed by a variety of molecular changes. Therefore, we aimed to find out molecular alteration in plasma using proteomics in patients with MCI for early detection of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). To achieve this, we performed two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF/MS, which is used to analyze the differentially expressed proteins. In our study, we found three significantly altered proteins. Out of three differentially expressed proteins, one was downregulated and two were upregulated in MCI individuals as compared to control. Further, In silico analysis showed that identified proteins are involved in pathways such as complement and coagulation cascades, platelet activation and AD. STRING interaction network analysis revealed that the majority of proteins including apolipoprotein E (APO-E) have a common association with Transthyretin (TTR) and fibrinogen chain beta (FGB) protein. This suggests that APO-E, TTR and FGB are the key proteins with which other proteins interact to exert other biological functions. Conclusively, these proteins showing differential expression in the plasma might be used as a potent signature in blood for the diagnosis of MCI individuals.",2023,2D-gel electrophoresis; Biomarker; Diffusion tensor imaging; Mild cognitive impairment; Proteomics,,"Singh, V; Mishra, VN; Thakur, MK"
Neuroprotective activity of a virus-safe nanofiltered human platelet lysate depleted of extracellular vesicles in Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury models.,"Brain administration of human platelet lysates (HPL) is a potential emerging biotherapy of neurodegenerative and traumatic diseases of the central nervous system. HPLs being prepared from pooled platelet concentrates, thereby increasing viral risks, manufacturing processes should incorporate robust virus-reduction treatments. We evaluated a 19 ± 2-nm virus removal nanofiltration process using hydrophilic regenerated cellulose hollow fibers on the properties of a neuroprotective heat-treated HPL (HPPL). Spiking experiments demonstrated >5.30 log removal of 20-22-nm non-enveloped minute virus of mice-mock particles using an immuno-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The nanofiltered HPPL (NHPPL) contained a range of neurotrophic factors like HPPL. There was >2 log removal of extracellular vesicles (EVs), associated with decreased expression of pro-thrombogenic phosphatidylserine and procoagulant activity. LC-MS/MS proteomics showed that ca. 80% of HPPL proteins, including neurotrophins, cytokines, and antioxidants, were still found in NHPPL, whereas proteins associated with some infections and cancer-associated pathways, pro-coagulation and EVs, were removed. NHPPL maintained intact neuroprotective activity in Lund human mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron model of Parkinson's disease (PD), stimulated the differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and showed preserved anti-inflammatory function upon intranasal administration in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, nanofiltration of HPL is feasible, lowers the viral, prothrombotic and procoagulant risks, and preserves the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in neuronal pre-clinical models of PD and TBI.",2023,human platelet lysate; nanofiltration; neuroprotection; prion; virus,,"Delila, L; Nebie, O; Le, NTN; Barro, L; Chou, ML; Wu, YW; Watanabe, N; Takahara, M; Buée, L; Blum, D; Devos, D; Burnouf, T"
"A Multi-Trait Association Analysis of Brain Disorders and Platelet Traits Identifies Novel Susceptibility Loci for Major Depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease.","Among candidate neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric risk-predictive biomarkers, platelet count, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width have been associated with the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) through epidemiological and genomic studies, suggesting partial co-heritability. We exploited these relationships for a multi-trait association analysis, using publicly available summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of all traits reported above. Gene-based enrichment tests were carried out, as well as a network analysis of significantly enriched genes. We analyzed 4,540,326 single nucleotide polymorphisms shared among the analyzed GWASs, observing 149 genome-wide significant multi-trait LD-independent associations (",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; genomics; major depressive disorder; multi-trait associations; platelets,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Depression; Transcription Factors; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins","Tirozzi, A; Quiccione, MS; Cerletti, C; Donati, MB; de Gaetano, G; Iacoviello, L; Gialluisi, A"
Engineered biomembrane-derived nanoparticles for nanoscale theranostics.,"Currently, biological membrane-derived nanoparticles (NPs) have shown enormous potential as drug delivery vehicles due to their outstanding biomimetic properties. To make these NPs more adaptive to complex biological systems, some methods have been developed to modify biomembranes and endow them with more functions while preserving their inherent natures. In this review, we introduce five common approaches used for biomembrane decoration: membrane hybridization, the postinsertion method, chemical methods, metabolism engineering and gene engineering. These methods can functionalize a series of biomembranes derived from red blood cells, white blood cells, tumor cells, platelets, exosomes and so on. Biomembrane engineering could markedly facilitate the targeted drug delivery, treatment and diagnosis of cancer, inflammation, immunological diseases, bone diseases and Alzheimer's disease. It is anticipated that these membrane modification techniques will advance biomembrane-derived NPs into broader applications in the future.",2023,biomembrane engineering; biomembrane-derived nanoparticles; biomimetic; nanoscale theranostics; targeted drug delivery,Precision Medicine; Drug Delivery Systems; Nanoparticles; Cell Membrane; Blood Platelets,"Wu, Z; Zhang, H; Yan, J; Wei, Y; Su, J"
"Interleukin-17 (IL-17) triggers systemic inflammation, peripheral vascular dysfunction, and related prothrombotic state in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent forms of neurodegenerative disorders. Previously, we have shown that in vivo administration of an IL-17 neutralizing antibody (IL-17Ab) rescues amyloid-β-induced neuro-inflammation and memory impairment, demonstrating the pivotal role of IL-17 in AD-derived cognitive deficit. Recently, AD has been recognized as a more intriguing pathology affecting vascular networks and platelet function. However, not much is known about peripheral vascular inflammation and how pro-inflammatory circulating cells/mediators could affect peripheral vessels' function. This study aimed to evaluate whether IL-17Ab treatment could also impact peripheral AD features, such as systemic inflammation, peripheral vascular dysfunction, and related pro-thrombotic state in a non-genetic mouse model of AD. Mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with Aβ",2023,Alzheimer's disease; IL-17; Immunological perturbance; Systemic inflammation; Vascular dysfunction,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Inflammation; Interleukin-17; Peptide Fragments","Vellecco, V; Saviano, A; Raucci, F; Casillo, GM; Mansour, AA; Panza, E; Mitidieri, E; Femminella, GD; Ferrara, N; Cirino, G; Sorrentino, R; Iqbal, AJ; d'Emmanuele di Villa Bianca, R; Bucci, M; Maione, F"
"Thiazolidin-4-one prevents against memory deficits, increase in phosphorylated tau protein, oxidative damage and cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer disease model: Comparison with donepezil drug.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized mostly by memory decline. The current therapeutic arsenal for treating AD is limited, and the available drugs only produce symptomatic benefits, but do not stop disease progression. The search for effective therapeutic alternatives with multitarget actions is therefore imperative. One such a potential alternative is thiazolidin-4-one, a compound that exhibits anti-amnesic, anticholinesterase, and antioxidant activities. The aim of this study was evaluated the effects of 2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)- 3-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl) thiazolidin-4-one (DS12) on memory and neurochemical parameters in a model of AD induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Adult male rats were divided into five groups: I, control (saline); II, DS12 (10 mg/kg); III, STZ; IV, STZ + DS12 (10 mg/kg); V, STZ + donepezil (5 mg/kg). The rats were orally treated with DS12 and donepezil for a period of 20 days. Memory, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, phosphorylated tau protein levels and oxidative stress were analyzed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Biochemical and hematological parameters were evaluated in the blood and serum. Memory impairment and the increase in AChE activity and phosphorylated tau protein level induced by STZ were prevented by DS12 and donepezil treatment. Streptozotocin induces an increase in reactive oxygen species levels and a decrease in catalase activity in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. DS12 treatment conferred protection from oxidative alterations in all brain structures. No changes were observed in serum biochemical parameters (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid, and urea) or hematological parameters, such as platelets, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total plasma protein. DS12 improved memory and neurochemical changes in an AD model and did not show toxic effects, suggesting the promising therapeutic potential of this compound.",2023,Acetylcholinesterase; Alzheimer’s disease; Brain; Oxidative stress; Tau protein; Thiazolidin-4-ones,"Rats; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Donepezil; tau Proteins; Streptozocin; Acetylcholinesterase; Oxidative Stress; Memory Disorders; Antioxidants; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Disease Models, Animal; Maze Learning","Dos Santos, A; Teixeira, FC; da Silva, DS; Veleda, TA; de Mello, JE; Luduvico, KP; Tavares, RG; Stefanello, FM; Cunico, W; Spanevello, RM"
Adropin and MOTS-c as new peptides: Do levels change in neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke?,"Neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (AD, PD), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) are thought to be deeply affected by changes in the pathophysiological processes of neurons. As new peptides, it was aimed to evaluate the level of adropin and MOTS-c (mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c) and its possible relationship with NSE (neuron-specific enolase) and NF-L (neurofilament light chain) in terms of neuronal interaction.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; MOTS-c; Parkinson's diseases; acute stroke; adropin; multiple sclerosis,Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Peptides; Transcription Factors,"Saçmacı, H; Çakır, M; Özcan, SS"
