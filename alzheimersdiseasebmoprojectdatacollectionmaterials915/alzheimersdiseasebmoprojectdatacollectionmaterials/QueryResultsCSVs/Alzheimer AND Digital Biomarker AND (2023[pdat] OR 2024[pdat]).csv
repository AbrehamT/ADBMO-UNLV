Comparative analysis of quantitative susceptibility mapping in preclinical dementia detection.,"This review aims to explore the role of Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) in the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). By examining QSM's ability to map brain iron deposition, we seek to highlight its potential as a diagnostic tool for preclinical dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Brain iron Levels; Fronto temporal dementia (FTD); Lewis body dementia (LBD); Microstructural changes; Pre-clinical dementia; Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM),,"Suresh Paul, J; T, AR; Raghavan, S; Kesavadas, C"
Identification of Parkinson's disease PACE subtypes and repurposing treatments through integrative analyses of multimodal data.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder marked by significant clinical and progression heterogeneity. This study aimed at addressing heterogeneity of PD through integrative analysis of various data modalities. We analyzed clinical progression data (≥5 years) of individuals with de novo PD using machine learning and deep learning, to characterize individuals' phenotypic progression trajectories for PD subtyping. We discovered three pace subtypes of PD exhibiting distinct progression patterns: the Inching Pace subtype (PD-I) with mild baseline severity and mild progression speed; the Moderate Pace subtype (PD-M) with mild baseline severity but advancing at a moderate progression rate; and the Rapid Pace subtype (PD-R) with the most rapid symptom progression rate. We found cerebrospinal fluid P-tau/α-synuclein ratio and atrophy in certain brain regions as potential markers of these subtypes. Analyses of genetic and transcriptomic profiles with network-based approaches identified molecular modules associated with each subtype. For instance, the PD-R-specific module suggested STAT3, FYN, BECN1, APOA1, NEDD4, and GATA2 as potential driver genes of PD-R. It also suggested neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, metabolism, PI3K/AKT, and angiogenesis pathways as potential drivers for rapid PD progression (i.e., PD-R). Moreover, we identified repurposable drug candidates by targeting these subtype-specific molecular modules using network-based approach and cell line drug-gene signature data. We further estimated their treatment effects using two large-scale real-world patient databases; the real-world evidence we gained highlighted the potential of metformin in ameliorating PD progression. In conclusion, this work helps better understand clinical and pathophysiological complexity of PD progression and accelerate precision medicine.",2024,,,"Su, C; Hou, Y; Xu, J; Xu, Z; Zhou, M; Ke, A; Li, H; Xu, J; Brendel, M; Maasch, JRMA; Bai, Z; Zhang, H; Zhu, Y; Cincotta, MC; Shi, X; Henchcliffe, C; Leverenz, JB; Cummings, J; Okun, MS; Bian, J; Cheng, F; Wang, F"
"Identification of retinal oligomeric, citrullinated, and other tau isoforms in early and advanced AD and relations to disease status.","This study investigates various pathological tau isoforms in the retina of individuals with early and advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD), exploring their connection with disease status. Retinal cross-sections from predefined superior-temporal and inferior-temporal subregions and corresponding brains from neuropathologically confirmed AD patients with a clinical diagnosis of either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (n = 45) were compared with retinas from age- and sex-matched individuals with normal cognition (n = 30) and non-AD dementia (n = 4). Retinal tau isoforms, including tau tangles, paired helical filament of tau (PHF-tau), oligomeric-tau (Oligo-tau), hyperphosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and citrullinated-tau (Cit-tau), were stereologically analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Nanostring GeoMx digital spatial profiling, and correlated with clinical and neuropathological outcomes.

Sharing brain imaging data in the Open Science era: how and why?,"The sharing of human neuroimaging data has great potential to accelerate the development of imaging biomarkers in neurological and psychiatric disorders; however, major obstacles remain in terms of how and why to share data in the Open Science context. In this Health Policy by the European Cluster for Imaging Biomarkers, we outline the current main opportunities and challenges based on the results of an online survey disseminated among senior scientists in the field. Although the scientific community fully recognises the importance of data sharing, technical, legal, and motivational aspects often prevent active adoption. Therefore, we provide practical advice on how to overcome the technical barriers. We also call for a harmonised application of the General Data Protection Regulation across EU countries.

Beyond Macrostructure: Is There a Role for Radiomics Analysis in Neuroimaging ?,"The most commonly used neuroimaging biomarkers of brain structure, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases, have traditionally been summary measurements from ROIs derived from structural MRI, such as volume and thickness. Advances in MR acquisition techniques, including high-field imaging, and emergence of learning-based methods have opened up opportunities to interrogate brain structure in finer detail, allowing investigators to move beyond macrostructural measurements. On the one hand, superior signal contrast has the potential to make appearance-based metrics that directly analyze intensity patterns, such as texture analysis and radiomics features, more reliable. Quantitative MRI, particularly at high-field, can also provide a richer set of measures with greater interpretability. On the other hand, use of neural networks-based techniques has the potential to exploit subtle patterns in images that can now be mined with advanced imaging. Finally, there are opportunities for integration of multimodal data at different spatial scales that is enabled by developments in many of the above techniques-for example, by combining digital histopathology with high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo MRI. Some of these approaches are at early stages of development and present their own set of challenges. Nonetheless, they hold promise to drive the next generation of validation and biomarker studies. This article will survey recent developments in this area, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. However, most of the discussion is equally relevant to imaging of other neurological disorders, and even to other organ systems of interest. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review of the available literature, but rather presented as a summary of recent trends through the discussion of a collection of representative studies with an eye towards what the future may hold.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; neural networks; neurodegenerative disorders; radiomics,"Humans; Neuroimaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Biomarkers; Neural Networks, Computer; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiomics","Das, SR; Ilesanmi, A; Wolk, DA; Gee, JC"
A Novel Computerized Cognitive Test for the Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Its Association with Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Prone Brain Regions.,"During the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative changes can be identified by measuring volumetric loss in AD-prone brain regions on MRI. Cognitive assessments that are sensitive enough to measure the early brain-behavior manifestations of AD and that correlate with biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to identify and monitor individuals at risk for dementia. Weak sensitivity to early cognitive change has been a major limitation of traditional cognitive assessments. In this study, we focused on expanding our previous work by determining whether a digitized cognitive stress test, the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning, Brief Computerized Version (LASSI-BC) could differentiate between Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) groups. A second focus was to correlate LASSI-BC performance to volumetric reductions in AD-prone brain regions. Data was gathered from 111 older adults who were comprehensively evaluated and administered the LASSI-BC. Eighty-seven of these participants (51 CU; 36 aMCI) underwent MR imaging. The volumes of 12 AD-prone brain regions were related to LASSI-BC and other memory tests correcting for False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results indicated that, even after adjusting for initial learning ability, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) on the LASSI-BC differentiated between CU and aMCI groups. An optimal combination of frPSI and initial learning strength on the LASSI-BC yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.876 (76.1% sensitivity, 82.7% specificity). Further, frPSI on the LASSI-BC was associated with volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and posterior cingulate.",2023,Cortical Thickness; LASSI-L; MRI Volume; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Proactive Semantic Interference,,"Curiel Cid, RE; Zheng, DD; Kitaigorodsky, M; Adjouadi, M; Crocco, EA; Georgiou, M; Gonzalez-Jimenez, C; Ortega, A; Goryawala, M; Nagornaya, N; Pattany, P; Sfakianaki, E; Visser, U; Loewenstein, DA"

Digital cognitive assessments as low-burden markers for predicting future cognitive decline and tau accumulation across the Alzheimer's spectrum.,"Digital cognitive assessments, particularly those that can be done at home, present as low burden biomarkers for participants and patients alike, but their effectiveness in diagnosis of Alzheimer's or predicting its trajectory is still unclear. Here, we assessed what utility or added value these digital cognitive assessments provide for identifying those at high risk for cognitive decline. We analyzed >500 ADNI participants who underwent a brief digital cognitive assessment and Aβ/tau PET scans, examining their ability to distinguish cognitive status and predict cognitive decline. Performance on the digital cognitive assessment were superior to both cortical Aβ and entorhinal tau in detecting mild cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline, with mnemonic discrimination deficits emerging as the most critical measure for predicting decline and future tau accumulation. Digital assessments are effective in identifying at-risk individuals, supporting their utility as low-burden tools for early Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.",2024,,,"Vanderlip, CR; Stark, CEL"

Modern scores for traditional tests - Review of the diagnostic potential of scores derived from word list learning tests in mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's Disease.,"Episodic memory impairment is one of the early hallmarks in Alzheimer's Disease. In the clinical diagnosis and research, episodic memory impairment is typically assessed using word lists that are repeatedly presented to and recalled by the participant across several trials. Until recently, total learning scores, which consist of the total number of words that are recalled by participants, were almost exclusively used for diagnostic purposes. The present review aims at summarizing evidence on additional scores derived from the learning trials which have recently been investigated more frequently regarding their diagnostic potential. These scores reflect item acquisition, error frequencies, strategy use, intertrial fluctuations, and recall consistency. Evidence was summarized regarding the effects of clinical status on these scores. Preclinical, mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's Disease stages were associated with a pattern of reduced item acquisition, more errors, less strategy use, and reduced access of items, indicating slowed and erroneous encoding. Practical implications and limitations of the present research will be discussed.",2024,Early Alzheimer's disease; Episodic memory; Mild cognitive impairment; Word list learning,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Memory and Learning Tests","Schäfer, S; Tröger, J; Kray, J"
APOE4 homozygozity represents a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's disease.,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of APOE4 homozygosity on Alzheimer's disease (AD) by examining its clinical, pathological and biomarker changes to see whether APOE4 homozygotes constitute a distinct, genetically determined form of AD. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and five large cohorts with AD biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis included 3,297 individuals for the pathological study and 10,039 for the clinical study. Findings revealed that almost all APOE4 homozygotes exhibited AD pathology and had significantly higher levels of AD biomarkers from age 55 compared to APOE3 homozygotes. By age 65, nearly all had abnormal amyloid levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and 75% had positive amyloid scans, with the prevalence of these markers increasing with age, indicating near-full penetrance of AD biology in APOE4 homozygotes. The age of symptom onset was earlier in APOE4 homozygotes at 65.1, with a narrower 95% prediction interval than APOE3 homozygotes. The predictability of symptom onset and the sequence of biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes mirrored those in autosomal dominant AD and Down syndrome. However, in the dementia stage, there were no differences in amyloid or tau positron emission tomography across haplotypes, despite earlier clinical and biomarker changes. The study concludes that APOE4 homozygotes represent a genetic form of AD, suggesting the need for individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials and treatments.",2024,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Age of Onset; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E3; Apolipoprotein E4; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Homozygote; Positron-Emission Tomography; tau Proteins","Fortea, J; Pegueroles, J; Alcolea, D; Belbin, O; Dols-Icardo, O; Vaqué-Alcázar, L; Videla, L; Gispert, JD; Suárez-Calvet, M; Johnson, SC; Sperling, R; Bejanin, A; Lleó, A; Montal, V"

Unveiling New Strategies Facilitating the Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging for the Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a global impact. The past few decades have witnessed significant strides in comprehending the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and developing diagnostic methodologies for AD, such as neuroimaging approaches. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have revolutionized the field by providing valuable insights into the structural and functional alterations in the brains of individuals with AD. These imaging modalities enable the detection of early biomarkers such as amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles, facilitating early and precise diagnosis. Furthermore, the emerging technologies encompassing blood-based biomarkers and neurochemical profiling exhibit promising results in the identification of specific molecular signatures for AD. The integration of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence has enhanced the predictive capacity of these diagnostic tools when analyzing complex datasets. In this review article, we will highlight not only some of the most used diagnostic imaging approaches in neurodegeneration research but focus much more on new tools like artificial intelligence, emphasizing their application in the realm of AD.

Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD.

Cognitive modeling of the Mnemonic Similarity Task as a digital biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease.,"AD related pathologies, such as beta-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are evident decades before any noticeable decline in memory occurs. Identifying individuals during this asymptomatic phase is crucial for timely intervention. The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST), a modified recognition memory task, is especially relevant for early AD screening, as it assesses hippocampal integrity, a region affected (both directly and indirectly) early in the progression of the disease. Further, strong inferences on the underlying cognitive mechanisms that support performance on this task can be made using Bayesian cognitive modeling. We assessed whether analyzing MST performance using a cognitive model could detect subtle changes in cognitive function and AD biomarker status prior to overt cognitive decline. We analyzed MST data from >200 individuals (young, cognitively healthy older adults, and individuals with MCI), a subset of which also had existing CSF Aβ and pTau data. Traditional performance scores and cognitive modeling using multinomial processing trees was applied to each participants MST data using Bayesian approaches. We assessed how well each could predict age group, memory ability, MCI status, Aβ/pTau status using ROC analyses. Both approaches predicted age group membership equally, but cognitive modeling approaches exceeded traditional metrics in all other comparisons. This work establishes that cognitive modeling of the MST can detect individuals with AD prior to cognitive decline, making it a potentially useful tool for both screening and monitoring older adults during the asymptomatic phase of AD.",2024,,,"Vanderlip, C; Lee, MD; Stark, CEL"

Machine Learning and Digital Biomarkers Can Detect Early Stages of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are devastating conditions that can develop without noticeable symptoms, causing irreversible damage to neurons before any signs become clinically evident. NDs are a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Currently, there are no cures or treatments to halt their progression. Therefore, the development of early detection methods is urgently needed to delay neuronal loss as soon as possible. Despite advancements in Medtech, the early diagnosis of NDs remains a challenge at the intersection of medical, IT, and regulatory fields. Thus, this review explores ""digital biomarkers"" (tools designed for remote neurocognitive data collection and AI analysis) as a potential solution. The review summarizes that recent studies combining AI with digital biomarkers suggest the possibility of identifying pre-symptomatic indicators of NDs. For instance, research utilizing convolutional neural networks for eye tracking has achieved significant diagnostic accuracies. ROC-AUC scores reached up to 0.88, indicating high model performance in differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls. Similarly, advancements in facial expression analysis through tools have demonstrated significant potential in detecting emotional changes in ND patients, with some models reaching an accuracy of 0.89 and a precision of 0.85. This review follows a structured approach to article selection, starting with a comprehensive database search and culminating in a rigorous quality assessment and meaning for NDs of the different methods. The process is visualized in 10 tables with 54 parameters describing different approaches and their consequences for understanding various mechanisms in ND changes. However, these methods also face challenges related to data accuracy and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this review proposes strategies that emphasize the need for rigorous validation and rapid integration into clinical practice. Such integration could transform ND diagnostics, making early detection tools more cost-effective and globally accessible. In conclusion, this review underscores the urgent need to incorporate validated digital health tools into mainstream medical practice. This integration could indicate a new era in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially altering the trajectory of these conditions for millions worldwide. Thus, by highlighting specific and statistically significant findings, this review demonstrates the current progress in this field and the potential impact of these advancements on the global management of NDs.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; digital endpoints; digital phenotyping; early detection; eye-tracking; machine learning; neurodegenerative diseases; online cognitive testing,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Biomarkers; Machine Learning,"Chudzik, A; Śledzianowski, A; Przybyszewski, AW"

Blood-Based Biomarkers for Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in Real-World Settings.,"As our knowledge about the biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) expands and we recognize the significance of early intervention for effective treatment, there is a shift in focus toward detecting the disease at an early stage. AD is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau proteins in the brain, leading to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While a definitive diagnosis of AD can only be confirmed through autopsy by examining these pathological features, there are now reliable methods available for diagnosing the disease in living individuals. These methods involve analyzing cerebrospinal fluid and using positron emission tomography to accurately assess the presence of Aβ and tau proteins. While these diagnostic markers have shown high accuracy in memory-clinic populations, they do have limitations such as the requirement for invasive lumbar puncture or exposure to ionizing radiation. Additionally, they are not easily accessible outside of specialized healthcare settings. Blood-based biomarkers of the core pathological features of AD are being developed, showing promise for less invasive, scalable identification of AD cases in the community. The advantages for the healthcare systems of this development are obvious, but the diagnostic performance of blood-based biomarkers in broader, non-selected populations outside of retrospective analyses and research cohorts still requires further investigation, including the combination with more effective neuropsychological assessments such as digital cognitive test solutions.",2024,Early and targeted treatment and prevention of neurodegeneration; Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; Patient and service user value; Scalable diagnostic technologies; Subjective cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Retrospective Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers,"Perneczky, R; Hansen, N; Hofmann, A; Laske, C; Priller, J; Grimmer, T; Frölich, L; Düzel, E; Jessen, F; Wiltfang, J"

DeepResBat: deep residual batch harmonization accounting for covariate distribution differences.,"Pooling MRI data from multiple datasets requires harmonization to reduce undesired inter-site variabilities, while preserving effects of biological variables (or covariates). The popular harmonization approach ComBat uses a mixed effect regression framework that explicitly accounts for covariate distribution differences across datasets. There is also significant interest in developing harmonization approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs), such as conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE). However, current DNN approaches do not explicitly account for covariate distribution differences across datasets. Here, we provide mathematical results, suggesting that not accounting for covariates can lead to suboptimal harmonization outcomes. We propose two DNN-based harmonization approaches that explicitly account for covariate distribution differences across datasets: covariate VAE (coVAE) and DeepResBat. The coVAE approach is a natural extension of cVAE by concatenating covariates and site information with site- and covariate-invariant latent representations. DeepResBat adopts a residual framework inspired by ComBat. DeepResBat first removes the effects of covariates with nonlinear regression trees, followed by eliminating site differences with cVAE. Finally, covariate effects are added back to the harmonized residuals. Using three datasets from three different continents with a total of 2787 participants and 10085 anatomical T1 scans, we find that DeepResBat and coVAE outperformed ComBat, CovBat and cVAE in terms of removing dataset differences, while enhancing biological effects of interest. However, coVAE hallucinates spurious associations between anatomical MRI and covariates even when no association exists. Therefore, future studies proposing DNN-based harmonization approaches should be aware of this false positive pitfall. Overall, our results suggest that DeepResBat is an effective deep learning alternative to ComBat.",2024,,,"An, L; Zhang, C; Wulan, N; Zhang, S; Chen, P; Ji, F; Ng, KK; Chen, C; Zhou, JH; Thomas Yeo, BT"
Naturalistic assessment of reaction time variability in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Maintaining attention underlies many aspects of cognition and becomes compromised early in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Estimating dementia risk in an African American population using the DCTclock.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is increasing. African Americans are twice as likely to develop dementia than other ethnic populations. Traditional cognitive screening solutions lack the sensitivity to independently identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline. The DCTclock is a 3-min AI-enabled adaptation of the well-established clock drawing test. The DCTclock can estimate dementia risk for both general cognitive impairment and the presence of AD pathology. Here we performed a retrospective analysis to assess the performance of the DCTclock to estimate future conversion to ADRD in African American participants from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and African American Clinical Core (AACORE). We assessed baseline DCTclock scores in 646 participants (baseline median age = 78.0 ± 6.4, median years of education = 14.0 ± 3.2, 78% female) and found significantly lower baseline DCTclock scores in those who received a dementia diagnosis within 3 years. We also found that 16.4% of participants with a baseline DCTclock score less than 60 were significantly more likely to develop dementia in 5 years vs. those with the highest DCTclock scores (75-100). This research demonstrates the DCTclock's ability to estimate the 5-year risk of developing dementia in an African American population. Early detection of elevated dementia risk using the DCTclock could provide patients, caregivers, and clinicians opportunities to plan and intervene early to improve cognitive health trajectories. Early detection of dementia risk can also enhance participant selection in clinical trials while reducing screening costs.",2023,African American clinical; Alzheimer’s disease; DCTclock; Minority Aging Research Study (MARS); Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center; dementia; dementia estimation,,"Ciesla, M; Pobst, J; Gomes-Osman, J; Lamar, M; Barnes, LL; Banks, R; Jannati, A; Libon, D; Swenson, R; Tobyne, S; Bates, D; Showalter, J; Pascual-Leone, A"

Digging into the intrinsic capacity concept: Can it be applied to Alzheimer's disease?,"Historically, aging research has largely centered on disease pathology rather than promoting healthy aging. The World Health Organization's (WHO) policy framework (2015-2030) underscores the significance of fostering the contributions of older individuals to their families, communities, and economies. The WHO has introduced the concept of intrinsic capacity (IC) as a key metric for healthy aging, encompassing five primary domains: locomotion, vitality, sensory, cognitive, and psychological. Past AD research, constrained by methodological limitations, has focused on single outcome measures, sidelining the complexity of the disease. Our current scientific milieu, however, is primed to adopt the IC concept. This is due to three critical considerations: (I) the decline in IC is linked to neurocognitive disorders, including AD, (II) cognition, a key component of IC, is deeply affected in AD, and (III) the cognitive decline associated with AD involves multiple factors and pathophysiological pathways. Our study explores the application of the IC concept to AD patients, offering a comprehensive model that could revolutionize the disease's diagnosis and prognosis. There is a dearth of information on the biological characteristics of IC, which are a result of complex interactions within biological systems. Employing a systems biology approach, integrating omics technologies, could aid in unraveling these interactions and understanding IC from a holistic viewpoint. This comprehensive analysis of IC could be leveraged in clinical settings, equipping healthcare providers to assess AD patients' health status more effectively and devise personalized therapeutic interventions in accordance with the precision medicine paradigm. We aimed to determine whether the IC concept could be extended from older individuals to patients with AD, thereby presenting a model that could significantly enhance the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Digital biomarkers; Digital healthcare; Dimensions; Intrinsic capacity; Systems biology,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aging,"López-Ortiz, S; Caruso, G; Emanuele, E; Menéndez, H; Peñín-Grandes, S; Guerrera, CS; Caraci, F; Nisticò, R; Lucia, A; Santos-Lozano, A; Lista, S"
Enhancing foveal avascular zone analysis for Alzheimer's diagnosis with AI segmentation and machine learning using multiple radiomic features.,"We propose a hybrid technique that employs artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation and machine learning classification using multiple features extracted from the foveal avascular zone (FAZ)-a retinal biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-to improve the disease diagnostic performance. Imaging data of optical coherence tomography angiography from 37 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 48 healthy controls were investigated. The presence or absence of brain amyloids was confirmed using amyloid positron emission tomography. In the superficial capillary plexus of the angiography scans, the FAZ was automatically segmented using an AI method to extract multiple biomarkers (area, solidity, compactness, roundness, and eccentricity), which were paired with clinical data (age and sex) as common correction variables. We used a light-gradient boosting machine (a light-gradient boosting machine is a machine learning algorithm based on trees utilizing gradient boosting) to diagnose Alzheimer's disease by integrating the corresponding multiple radiomic biomarkers. Fivefold cross-validation was applied for analysis, and the diagnostic performance for Alzheimer's disease was determined by the area under the curve. The proposed hybrid technique achieved an area under the curve of [Formula: see text]%, outperforming the existing single-feature (area) criteria by over 13%. Furthermore, in the holdout test set, the proposed technique exhibited a 14% improvement compared to single features, achieving an area under the curve of 72.0± 4.8%. Based on these facts, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our technology in achieving significant performance improvements in FAZ-based Alzheimer's diagnosis research through the use of multiple radiomic biomarkers (area, solidity, compactness, roundness, and eccentricity).",2024,,"Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Alzheimer Disease; Radiomics; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Machine Learning; Biomarkers","Yoon, JM; Lim, CY; Noh, H; Nam, SW; Jun, SY; Kim, MJ; Song, MY; Jang, H; Kim, HJ; Seo, SW; Na, DL; Chung, MJ; Ham, DI; Kim, K"
Intelligent digital tools for screening of brain connectivity and dementia risk estimation in people affected by mild cognitive impairment: the AI-Mind clinical study protocol.,"More than 10 million Europeans show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal brain aging and dementia stage memory disorder. The path MCI takes can be divergent; while some maintain stability or even revert to cognitive norms, alarmingly, up to half of the cases progress to dementia within 5 years. Current diagnostic practice lacks the necessary screening tools to identify those at risk of progression. The European patient experience often involves a long journey from the initial signs of MCI to the eventual diagnosis of dementia. The trajectory is far from ideal. Here, we introduce the AI-Mind project, a pioneering initiative with an innovative approach to early risk assessment through the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) on multimodal data.

Intron retention as a productive mechanism in human MAPT: RNA species generated by retention of intron 3.,"Tau is a microtubule-binding protein encoded by the MAPT gene. Tau is essential for several physiological functions and associated with pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Six tau isoforms are typically described in the central nervous system, but current research paints a more diverse landscape and a more nuanced balance between isoforms. Recent work has described tau isoforms generated by intron 11 and intron 12 retention. This work adds to that evidence, proving the existence of MAPT transcripts retaining intron 3.

Comprehensive allostatic load risk index is associated with increased frontal and left parietal white matter hyperintensities in mid-life cognitively healthy adults.,"To date, there is a considerable heterogeneity of methods to score Allostatic Load (AL). Here we propose a comprehensive algorithm (ALCS) that integrates commonly used approaches to generate AL risk categories and assess associations to brain structure deterioration. In a cohort of cognitively normal mid-life adults (n = 620, age 51.3 ± 5.48 years), we developed a comprehensive composite for AL scoring incorporating gender and age differences, high quartile approach, clinical reference values, and current medications, to then generate AL risk categories. Compared to the empirical approach (ALES), ALCS showed better model fit criteria and a strong association with age and sex. ALSC categories were regressed against brain and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes. Higher AL risk categories were associated with increased total, periventricular, frontal, and left parietal WMH volumes, also showing better fit compared to ALES. When cardiovascular biomarkers were removed from the ALSC algorithm, only left-frontal WMHV remained associated with AL, revealing a strong vascular burden influencing the index. Our results agree with previous evidence and suggest that sustained stress exposure enhances brain deterioration in mid-life adults. Showing better fit than ALES, our comprehensive algorithm can provide a more accurate AL estimation to explore how stress exposure enhances age-related health decline.",2024,,Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; White Matter; Allostasis; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Buller-Peralta, I; Gregory, S; Low, A; Dounavi, ME; Bridgeman, K; Ntailianis, G; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Koychev, I; Malhotra, P; O'Brien, JT; Ritchie, CW; Muniz-Terrera, G"

Subject Harmonization of Digital Biomarkers: Improved Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the early stage of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a crucial stage for therapeutic interventions and treatment. Early detection of MCI offers opportunities for early intervention and significantly benefits cohort enrichment for clinical trials. Imaging and in vivo markers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have high detection performance, yet their prohibitive costs and intrusiveness demand more affordable and accessible alternatives. The recent advances in digital biomarkers, especially language markers, have shown great potential, where variables informative to MCI are derived from linguistic and/or speech and later used for predictive modeling. A major challenge in modeling language markers comes from the variability of how each person speaks. As the cohort size for language studies is usually small due to extensive data collection efforts, the variability among persons makes language markers hard to generalize to unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel subject harmonization tool to address the issue of distributional differences in language markers across subjects, thus enhancing the generalization performance of machine learning models. Our empirical results show that machine learning models built on our harmonized features have improved prediction performance on unseen data.

Alzheimer's in the modern age: Ethical challenges in the use of digital monitoring to identify cognitive changes.,"Pushes toward earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cognitive changes are creating interest in leveraging technologies, like cellphones, that are already widespread and well-equipped for data collection to facilitate digital monitoring for AD. Studies are ongoing to identify and validate potential ""digital biomarkers"" that might indicate someone has or is at risk of developing AD dementia. Digital biomarkers for AD have potential as a tool in aiding more timely diagnosis, though more robust research is needed to support their validity and utility. While there are grounds for optimism, leveraging digital monitoring and informatics for cognitive changes also poses ethical challenges, related to topics such as algorithmic bias, consent, and data privacy and security. As we confront the modern era of Alzheimer's disease, individuals, companies, regulators and policymakers alike must prepare for a future in which our day-to-day interactions with technology in our daily life may identify AD-related cognitive changes.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; cognition; digital biomarkers; ethics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Longitudinal Studies; Cognition,"Erickson, CM; Wexler, A; Largent, EA"
Resting-state EEG signatures of Alzheimer's disease are driven by periodic but not aperiodic changes.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasize the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",2024,Alzheimer's; Dementia; EEG; Oscillations,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Electroencephalography; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Rest,"Kopčanová, M; Tait, L; Donoghue, T; Stothart, G; Smith, L; Flores-Sandoval, AA; Davila-Perez, P; Buss, S; Shafi, MM; Pascual-Leone, A; Fried, PJ; Benwell, CSY"
The effect of EEG and fNIRS in the digital assessment and digital therapy of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,"In the context of population aging, the growing problem of Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a great challenge to mankind. Although there has been considerable progress in exploring the etiology of AD, i.e., the important role of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the progression of AD has been widely accepted by the scientific community, traditional treatment and monitoring modalities have significant limitations. Therefore novel evaluation and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease are called for emergence. In this research, we sought to review the effectiveness of digital treatment based on monitoring using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). This work searched four electronic databases using a keyword approach and focused on journals focusing on AD and geriatric cognition. Finally, 21 articles were included. The progress of digital therapy and outcome monitoring in AD was reviewed, including digital therapy approaches on different platforms and different neuromonitoring techniques. Because biomarkers such as theta coherence, alpha and beta rhythms, and oxyhemoglobin are effective in monitoring the cognitive level of AD patients, and thus the efficacy of digital therapies, this review particularly focuses on the biomarker validation results of digital therapies. The results show that digital treatment based on biomarker monitoring has good effectiveness. And the effectiveness is reflected in the numerical changes of biomarker indicators monitored by EEG and fNIRS before and after digital treatment. Increases or decreases in the values of these indicators collectively point to improvements in cognitive function (mostly moderate to large effect sizes). The study is the first to examine the state of digital therapy in AD from the perspective of multimodal monitoring, which broadens the research perspective on the effectiveness of AD and gives clinical therapists a ""reference list"" of treatment options. They can select a specific protocol from this ""reference list"" in order to tailor digital therapy to the needs of individual patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; EEG; digital assessment; digital therapy; fNIRS,,"Zhang, Y; Zhang, Y; Jiang, Z; Xu, M; Qing, K"

These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

Here, we report the results of TANGO ( NCT03352557 ), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and multiple-dose long-term trial of gosuranemab-a monoclonal antibody to N-terminal tau-in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of gosuranemab compared to placebo. The secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of multiple doses of gosuranemab in slowing cognitive and functional impairment (using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores at week 78) and evaluate the immunogenicity of gosuranemab (using the incidence of anti-gosuranemab antibody responses). Participants were randomized (n = 654); received (n = 650) low-dose (125 mg once every 4 weeks (q4w), n = 58; 375 mg q12w, n = 58), intermediate-dose (600 mg q4w, n = 106) or high-dose (2,000 mg q4w, n = 214) gosuranemab or placebo (q4w, n = 214) intravenously for 78 weeks; and assigned to cerebrospinal fluid (n = 327) and/or tau positron emission tomography (n = 357) biomarker substudies. Gosuranemab had an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated (incidence of serious adverse events: placebo, 12.1%; low dose, 10.3%; intermediate dose, 12.3%; high dose, 11.7%). The incidence of treatment-emergent gosuranemab antibody responses was low at all time points.

Employing Deep-Learning Approach for the Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Transitions through the Analysis of Digital Biomarkers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the precursor to the advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it is important to detect the transition to the MCI condition as early as possible. Trends in daily routines/activities provide a measurement of cognitive/functional status, particularly in older adults. In this study, activity data from longitudinal monitoring through in-home ambient sensors are leveraged in predicting the transition to the MCI stage at a future time point. The activity dataset from the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) includes measures representing various domains such as walk, sleep, etc. Each sensor-captured activity measure is constructed as a time series, and a variety of summary statistics is computed. The similarity between one individual's activity time series and that of the remaining individuals is also computed as distance measures. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is trained with time series statistics and distance measures for the prediction modeling, and performance is evaluated by classification accuracy. The model outcomes are explained using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. LSTM model trained using the time series statistics and distance measures outperforms other modeling scenarios, including baseline classifiers, with an overall prediction accuracy of 83.84%. SHAP values reveal that sleep-related features contribute the most to the prediction of the cognitive stage at the future time point, and this aligns with the findings in the literature. Findings from this study not only demonstrate that a practical, less expensive, longitudinal monitoring of older adults' activity routines can benefit immensely in modeling AD progression but also unveil the most contributing features that are medically applicable and meaningful.",2023,AD progression; MCI transition; RNN LSTM; daily activities; deep learning; digital biomarkers; time series statistic,Humans; Aged; Deep Learning; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Aging,"Narasimhan, R; Gopalan, M; Sikkandar, MY; Alassaf, A; AlMohimeed, I; Alhussaini, K; Aleid, A; Sheik, SB"

Personalized relapse prediction in patients with major depressive disorder using digital biomarkers.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic illness wherein relapses contribute to significant patient morbidity and mortality. Near-term prediction of relapses in MDD patients has the potential to improve outcomes by helping implement a 'predict and preempt' paradigm in clinical care. In this study, we developed a novel personalized (N-of-1) encoder-decoder anomaly detection-based framework of combining anomalies in multivariate actigraphy features (passive) as triggers to utilize an active concurrent self-reported symptomatology questionnaire (core symptoms of depression and anxiety) to predict near-term relapse in MDD. The framework was evaluated on two independent longitudinal observational trials, characterized by regular bimonthly (every other month) in-person clinical assessments, weekly self-reported symptom assessments, and continuous activity monitoring data with two different wearable sensors for ≥ 1 year or until the first relapse episode. This combined passive-active relapse prediction framework achieved a balanced accuracy of ≥ 71%, false alarm rate of ≤ 2.3 alarm/patient/year with a median relapse detection time of 2-3 weeks in advance of clinical onset in both studies. The study results suggest that the proposed personalized N-of-1 prediction framework is generalizable and can help predict a majority of MDD relapses in an actionable time frame with relatively low patient and provider burden.",2023,,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Biomarkers; Chronic Disease; Self Report; Recurrence","Vairavan, S; Rashidisabet, H; Li, QS; Ness, S; Morrison, RL; Soares, CN; Uher, R; Frey, BN; Lam, RW; Kennedy, SH; Trivedi, M; Drevets, WC; Narayan, VA"

Digital Marker for Early Screening of Mild Cognitive Impairment Through Hand and Eye Movement Analysis in Virtual Reality Using Machine Learning: First Validation Study.,"With the global rise in Alzheimer disease (AD), early screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a preclinical stage of AD, is of paramount importance. Although biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid amyloid level and magnetic resonance imaging have been studied, they have limitations, such as high cost and invasiveness.

Ultrasound-enhanced catalytic hairpin assembly capable of ultrasensitive microRNA biosensing for the early screening of Alzheimer's disease.,"Catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) is a promising enzyme-free, isothermal signal amplification strategy, but the relatively time-consuming strand replacement limits its application scenarios. Here, we developed an ultrasound-enhanced catalytic hairpin assembly (UECHA) biosensing platform for early screening of Alzheimer's disease by introducing a portable acoustic-drive platform with functionalized microspheres for effective biomarkers enrichment and fluorescence enhancement. By constructing a gradient ultrasonic field in a microcavity, the platform concentrates the functionalized microspheres in a central position, accompanied by an enhanced fluorescence signal with a specific release. In addition, the programmable frequency modulation can also modify the acoustic potential well and effectively promote non-equilibrium chemical reactions such as CHA (25 min). Compared with the conventional catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), UECHA allows for direct and quantitative measurement of AD miRNAs down to 3.55 × 10",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Biosensing; Enrichment; Fluorescence; Portable,Humans; MicroRNAs; Alzheimer Disease; Biosensing Techniques; Catalysis; Biomarkers; Limit of Detection,"Luo, Y; Chen, J; Liang, J; Liu, Y; Liu, C; Liu, Y; Xu, T; Zhang, X"

Detecting value(s): Digital biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and the valuation of new diagnostic technologies.,"This article explores how the meanings and values of diagnosis are being reconfigured at the interface between technological innovation and imaginaries of precision medicine. From genome sequencing to biological and digital 'markers' of disease, technological innovation occupies an increasingly central space in the way we imagine future health and illness. These imaginaries are usually centred on the promise of faster, more precise and personalised diagnosis, and the associated hope that if detected early enough disease can be effectively treated and prevented. Underpinning and reproduced through these narratives of the future is a re-conceptualisation of diagnostic processes and categories around the anticipation of future risk, as noted by recent theoretical developments in the sociology of diagnosis and related disciplines. Adding to this literature, in this article we explore what makes these emerging diagnostic arrangements valuable, to whom and how. Drawing on interviews with experts involved in the development of digital biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, we trace how multiple and at times conflicting applications of the tools, and the value(s) attached to them, are coproduced. We thus ask what possibilities are pursued, or foreclosed, through the work of imagining the future of diagnosis.",2024,diagnosis; digital health; risk; screening; surveillance medicine,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Inventions; Precision Medicine; Sociology,"Costa, A; Milne, R"
Interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on trajectories of tau accumulation.,"Cerebrovascular pathology often co-exists with Alzheimer's disease pathology and can contribute to Alzheimer's disease-related clinical progression. However, the degree to which vascular burden contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathological progression is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on both baseline tau tangle load and longitudinal tau accumulation. We included 1229 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 Study, including cognitively unimpaired and impaired participants with and without biomarker-confirmed amyloid-β pathology. All underwent baseline tau-PET (18F-RO948), and a subset (n = 677) underwent longitudinal tau-PET after 2.5 ± 1.0 years. Tau-PET uptake was computed for a temporal meta-region-of-interest. We focused on four main vascular imaging features and risk factors: microbleeds; white matter lesion volume; stroke-related events (infarcts, lacunes and haemorrhages); and the Framingham Heart Study Cardiovascular Disease risk score. To validate our in vivo results, we examined 1610 autopsy cases from an Arizona-based neuropathology cohort on three main vascular pathological features: cerebral amyloid angiopathy; white matter rarefaction; and infarcts. For the in vivo cohort, primary analyses included age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear mixed models between tau-PET (outcome) and interactions between time, amyloid-β and each vascular feature (predictors). For the neuropathology cohort, age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear models between tau tangle density (outcome) and an interaction between plaque density and each vascular feature (predictors) were performed. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we observed a significant interaction between microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology on greater baseline tau load (β = 0.68, P < 0.001) and longitudinal tau accumulation (β = 0.11, P < 0.001). For white matter lesion volume, we did not observe a significant independent interaction effect with amyloid-β on tau after accounting for microbleeds. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we further found that stroke-related events showed a significant negative interaction with amyloid-β on longitudinal tau (β = -0.08, P < 0.001). In cognitively impaired individuals, there were no significant interaction effects between cerebrovascular and amyloid-β pathology at all. In the neuropathology dataset, the in vivo observed interaction effects between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and plaque density (β = 0.38, P < 0.001) and between infarcts and plaque density (β = -0.11, P = 0.005) on tau tangle density were replicated. To conclude, we demonstrated that cerebrovascular pathology-in the presence of amyloid-β pathology-modifies tau accumulation in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, the co-occurrence of microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology was associated with greater accumulation of tau aggregates during early disease stages. This opens the possibility that interventions targeting microbleeds may attenuate the rate of tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; tau; vascular burden; vascular risk,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Stroke; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Plaque, Amyloid; Infarction; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Apolipoproteins E","Coomans, EM; van Westen, D; Binette, AP; Strandberg, O; Spotorno, N; Serrano, GE; Beach, TG; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Ossenkoppele, R; Hansson, O"

The FNAME was administered to 257 participants across the clinical spectrum with 122 having amyloid biomarkers. Linear regression explored the association between demographics and FNAME and between amyloid (+/-) groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) identified performance thresholds that best discriminated between biomarker (+/-) individuals. Lower FNAME scores occurred in males, older ages, Black/African Americans, Hispanics, and biomarker-positive participants. ROC analyses demonstrated acceptable accuracy (0.73 to 0.77) but only when combined with clinical status. The diagnostic discrimination of amyloid positivity was acceptable but not excellent, suggesting the FNAME may be a better screening indicator of clinical status rather than amyloid deposition in cognitively normal individuals.

Dissociating memory and executive function impairment through temporal features in a word list verbal learning task.,"The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is an established verbal learning test commonly used to quantify memory impairments due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) both at a clinical dementia stage or prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Focal memory impairment-as quantified e.g. by the RAVLT-at an MCI stage is referred to as amnestic MCI (aMCI) and is often regarded as the cognitive phenotype of prodromal AD. However, recent findings suggest that not only learning and memory but also other cognitive domains, especially executive functions (EF) and processing speed (PS), influence verbal learning performance. This research investigates whether additional temporal features extracted from audio recordings from a participant's RAVLT response can better dissociate memory and EF in such tasks and eventually help to better describe MCI subtypes. 675 age-matched participants from the H70 Swedish birth cohort were included in this analysis; 68 participants were classified as MCI (33 aMCI and 35 due to executive impairment). RAVLT performances were recorded and temporal features extracted. Novel temporal features were correlated with established neuropsychological tests measuring EF and PS. Lastly, the downstream diagnostic potential of temporal features was estimated using group differences and a machine learning (ML) classification scenario. Temporal features correlated moderately with measures of EF and PS. Performance of an ML classifier could be improved by adding temporal features to traditional counts. We conclude that RAVLT temporal features are in general related to EF and that they might be capable of dissociating memory and EF in a word list learning task.",2023,Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; RAVLT; Speech analysis; Temporal analysis; aMCI; exMCI,,"Dörr, F; Schäfer, S; Öhman, F; Linz, N; Bodin, TH; Skoog, J; Zettergren, A; Kern, S; Skoog, I; Tröger, J"

A two-step workflow based on plasma p-tau217 to screen for amyloid β positivity with further confirmatory testing only in uncertain cases.,"Cost-effective strategies for identifying amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity in patients with cognitive impairment are urgently needed with recent approvals of anti-Aβ immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood biomarkers can accurately detect AD pathology, but it is unclear whether their incorporation into a full diagnostic workflow can reduce the number of confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) tests needed while accurately classifying patients. We evaluated a two-step workflow for determining Aβ-PET status in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from two independent memory clinic-based cohorts (n = 348). A blood-based model including plasma tau protein 217 (p-tau217), age and APOE ε4 status was developed in BioFINDER-1 (area under the curve (AUC) = 89.3%) and validated in BioFINDER-2 (AUC = 94.3%). In step 1, the blood-based model was used to stratify the patients into low, intermediate or high risk of Aβ-PET positivity. In step 2, we assumed referral only of intermediate-risk patients to CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 testing, whereas step 1 alone determined Aβ-status for low- and high-risk groups. Depending on whether lenient, moderate or stringent thresholds were used in step 1, the two-step workflow overall accuracy for detecting Aβ-PET status was 88.2%, 90.5% and 92.0%, respectively, while reducing the number of necessary CSF tests by 85.9%, 72.7% and 61.2%, respectively. In secondary analyses, an adapted version of the BioFINDER-1 model led to successful validation of the two-step workflow with a different plasma p-tau217 immunoassay in patients with cognitive impairment from the TRIAD cohort (n = 84). In conclusion, using a plasma p-tau217-based model for risk stratification of patients with MCI can substantially reduce the need for confirmatory testing while accurately classifying patients, offering a cost-effective strategy to detect AD in memory clinic settings.",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Workflow; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Blood Proteins; Alzheimer Disease","Brum, WS; Cullen, NC; Janelidze, S; Ashton, NJ; Zimmer, ER; Therriault, J; Benedet, AL; Rahmouni, N; Tissot, C; Stevenson, J; Servaes, S; Triana-Baltzer, G; Kolb, HC; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Rosa-Neto, P; Blennow, K; Hansson, O"

Precision medicine in neurodegeneration: the IHI-PROMINENT project.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are one of the most important contributors to morbidity and mortality in the elderly.

European Projects for Patients with Dementia and Their Caregivers.,"As we all know there is no treatment that can stop or delay the progression of dementia. The treatment we use is only symptomatic. EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) recommendations for dementia prevention by Sorbi et al. (2012) concluded that there is no treatment, no lifestyle, which could have an effect on prevention or delay of onset of different forms of dementia until today. The future studies in prevention must recruit younger people, larger sample, and for longer period. The last 10 years we have run, in collaboration with organizations in different European countries, many projects in order to support patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly patients with dementia and their caregivers. The first project was a 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe: predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS (Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe) study, an FP5 project with 1380 patients. Five studies were published. The second project was DESCRIPA study, an FP5 project to DEvelopment of Screening guidelines and clinical CRIteria for Predementia Alzheimer's disease, with 881 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). LLM (Long Lasting Memories) and VRADA (A virtual reality application for the exercise of dementia and Alzheimer patients) are two projects that include body and cognitive exercise for health for the elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment. The next is the RECAGE (REspectful Caring for the AGitated Elderly) project (Horizon 2020), a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. With six European universities we finished a very interesting FP6 project, the AddNeuroMed one, which gives even now information about the progression of normal elderly MCI and AD patients, in collaboration with other consortia. A very interesting Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project about digital biomarkers was entitled Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR project). The main goal of this project was the development and validation of technology-enabled, quantitative and sensitive measures of functional decline in people with early-stage AD. A running project is an Erasmus+ one in the higher education field, ""Genetic counseling in European universities: The case of neurodegenerative diseases"" (GECONEU project). The target of this study is to develop an online course for university students focusing on genetic counseling, and support people and society to better understand the aims of genetic testing and the usefulness of genetic counseling by involving students in an innovative learning and teaching setting.

Methods to Discover and Validate Biofluid-Based Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Dementias.,"Neurodegenerative dementias are progressive diseases that cause neuronal network breakdown in different brain regions often because of accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain extracellular matrix, such as amyloids or inside neurons or other cell types of the brain. Several diagnostic protein biomarkers in body fluids are being used and implemented, such as for Alzheimer's disease. However, there is still a lack of biomarkers for co-pathologies and other causes of dementia. Such biofluid-based biomarkers enable precision medicine approaches for diagnosis and treatment, allow to learn more about underlying disease processes, and facilitate the development of patient inclusion and evaluation tools in clinical trials. When designing studies to discover novel biofluid-based biomarkers, choice of technology is an important starting point. But there are so many technologies to choose among. To address this, we here review the technologies that are currently available in research settings and, in some cases, in clinical laboratory practice.

STRIDE: Systematic Radar Intelligence Analysis for ADRD Risk Evaluation with Gait Signature Simulation and Deep Learning.,"Abnormal gait is a significant non-cognitive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). Micro-Doppler radar, a non-wearable technology, can capture human gait movements for potential early ADRD risk assessment. In this research, we propose to design STRIDE integrating micro-Doppler radar sensors with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. STRIDE embeds a new deep learning (DL) classification framework. As a proof of concept, we develop a ""digital-twin"" of STRIDE, consisting of a human walking simulation model and a micro-Doppler radar simulation model, to generate a gait signature dataset. Taking established human walking parameters, the walking model simulates individuals with ADRD under various conditions. The radar model based on electromagnetic scattering and the Doppler frequency shift model is employed to generate micro-Doppler signatures from different moving body parts (e.g., foot, limb, joint, torso, shoulder, etc.). A band-dependent DL framework is developed to predict ADRD risks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of STRIDE for evaluating ADRD risk.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia; Deep learning; gait analysis; micro-Doppler radar,,"Cai, F; Patharkar, A; Wu, T; Lure, FYM; Chen, H; Chen, VC"
Data sharing in neurodegenerative disease research: challenges and learnings from the innovative medicines initiative public-private partnership model.,"Efficient data sharing is hampered by an array of organizational, ethical, behavioral, and technical challenges, slowing research progress and reducing the utility of data generated by clinical research studies on neurodegenerative diseases. There is a particular need to address differences between public and private sector environments for research and data sharing, which have varying standards, expectations, motivations, and interests. The Neuronet data sharing Working Group was set up to understand the existing barriers to data sharing in public-private partnership projects, and to provide guidance to overcome these barriers, by convening data sharing experts from diverse projects in the IMI neurodegeneration portfolio. In this policy and practice review, we outline the challenges and learnings of the WG, providing the neurodegeneration community with examples of good practices and recommendations on how to overcome obstacles to data sharing. These obstacles span organizational issues linked to the unique structure of cross-sectoral, collaborative research initiatives, to technical issues that affect the storage, structure and annotations of individual datasets. We also identify sociotechnical hurdles, such as academic recognition and reward systems that disincentivise data sharing, and legal challenges linked to heightened perceptions of data privacy risk, compounded by a lack of clear guidance on GDPR compliance mechanisms for public-private research. Focusing on real-world, neuroimaging and digital biomarker data, we highlight particular challenges and learnings for data sharing, such as data management planning, development of ethical codes of conduct, and harmonization of protocols and curation processes. Cross-cutting solutions and enablers include the principles of transparency, standardization and co-design - from open, accessible metadata catalogs that enhance findability of data, to measures that increase visibility and trust in data reuse.",2023,GDPR; data sharing; digital endpoint; innovative medicines initiative; neurodegenerative disease; real world data,,"Bradshaw, A; Hughes, N; Vallez-Garcia, D; Chokoshvili, D; Owens, A; Hansen, C; Emmert, K; Maetzler, W; Killin, L; Barnes, R; Brookes, AJ; Visser, PJ; Hofmann-Apitius, M; Diaz, C; Steukers, L"
Capturing Measures That Matter: The Potential Value of Digital Measures of Physical Behavior for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of dementia worldwide. Despite the magnitude of AD's impact on patients, caregivers, and society, nearly all AD clinical trials fail. A potential contributor to this high rate of failure is that established clinical outcome assessments fail to capture subtle clinical changes, entail high burden for patients and their caregivers, and ineffectively address the aspects of health deemed important by patients and their caregivers. AD progression is associated with widespread changes in physical behavior that have impacts on the ability to function independently, which is a meaningful aspect of health for patients with AD and important for diagnosis. However, established assessments of functional independence remain underutilized in AD clinical trials and are limited by subjective biases and ceiling effects. Digital measures of real-world physical behavior assessed passively, continuously, and remotely using digital health technologies have the potential to address some of these limitations and to capture aspects of functional independence in patients with AD. In particular, measures of real-world gait, physical activity, and life-space mobility captured with wearable sensors may offer value. Additional research is needed to understand the validity, feasibility, and acceptability of these measures in AD clinical research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; digital measure; drug development; gait; life-space mobility; meaningful aspect of health; physical behavior; physical function; wearable sensor,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Caregivers; Drug Development,"Bachman, SL; Blankenship, JM; Busa, M; Serviente, C; Lyden, K; Clay, I"
Spatial cognition is associated with levels of phosphorylated-tau and β-amyloid in clinically normal older adults.,Spatial cognition is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the symptomatic stages of the disease.

Using Biomarkers for Cognitive Enhancement and Evaluation in Mobile Applications.,"Clinicians are increasingly using biomarkers to diagnose and monitor cognitive conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Biomarkers are classified into two main categories based on their clinical goal: disease-associated biomarkers and drug-related biomarkers. In the case of disease-associated biomarkers, neuroimaging biomarkers are used to predict and validate Alzheimer's disease at any of its stages including mild cognitive impairment. The use of mobile and wearable devices to collect data about a person's daily activities and behaviors has led to the emergence of a new type of biomarker known as digital biomarkers. This type of data provides a digital reflection of a person's function in the context of everyday life and can be used to monitor and track changes in an individual's health and behaviors over time. The use of biomarkers in mobile applications for cognitive enhancement and evaluation can provide valuable insights into an individual's cognitive health and can help to optimize treatment and prevention strategies.",2023,Biomarkers; Cognitive enhancement; Digital biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Mobile Applications; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Disease Progression; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Giannopoulou, P; Vlamos, P"
Making Pre-screening for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Postoperative Delirium Among Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) a National Priority: The Deep Neuro Study.,"SARS-CoV-2 effects on cognition are a vibrant area of active research. Many researchers suggest that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms leading to hospitalization sustain significant neurodegenerative injury, such as encephalopathy and poor discharge disposition. However, despite some post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) case series that have described elevated neurodegenerative biomarkers, no studies have been identified that directly compared levels to those in mild cognitive impairment, non-PACS postoperative delirium patients after major non-emergent surgery, or preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients that have clinical evidence of Alzheimer's without symptoms. According to recent estimates, there may be 416 million people globally on the AD continuum, which include approximately 315 million people with preclinical AD. In light of all the above, a more effective application of digital biomarker and explainable artificial intelligence methodologies that explored amyloid beta, neuronal, axonal, and glial markers in relation to neurological complications in-hospital or later outcomes could significantly assist progress in the field. Easy and scalable subjects' risk stratification is of utmost importance, yet current international collaboration initiatives are still challenging due to the limited explainability and accuracy to identify individuals at risk or in the earliest stages that might be candidates for future clinical trials. In this open letter, we propose the administration of selected digital biomarkers previously discovered and validated in other EU-funded studies to become a routine assessment for non-PACS preoperative cognitive impairment, PACS neurological complications in-hospital, or later PACS and non-PACS improvement in cognition after surgery. The open letter also includes an economic analysis of the implications for such national-level initiatives. Similar collaboration initiatives could have existing pre-diagnostic detection and progression prediction solutions pre-screen the stage before and around diagnosis, enabling new disease manifestation mapping and pushing the field into unchartered territory.",2023,Artificial intelligence; Digital biomarkers; Genetics; National priority projects,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Artificial Intelligence; Emergence Delirium; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Tarnanas, I; Tsolaki, M"

Reduced slow-wave activity and autonomic dysfunction during sleep precede cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.,"Occurrence of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation in brain begins before the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as preclinical AD. Studies have reported that sleep problems and autonomic dysfunction associate closely with AD. However, whether they, especially the interaction between sleep and autonomic function, play critical roles in preclinical AD are unclear. Therefore, we investigated how sleep patterns and autonomic regulation at different sleep-wake stages changed and whether they were related to cognitive performance in pathogenesis of AD mice. Polysomnographic recordings in freely-moving APP/PS1 and wild-type (WT) littermates were collected to study sleep patterns and autonomic function at 4 (early disease stage) and 8 months of age (advanced disease stage), cognitive tasks including novel object recognition and Morris water maze were performed, and Aβ levels in brain were measured. APP/PS1 mice at early stage of AD pathology with Aβ aggregation but without significant differences in cognitive performance had frequent sleep-wake transitions, lower sleep-related delta power percentage, lower overall autonomic activity, and lower parasympathetic activity mainly during sleep compared with WT mice. The same phenomenon was observed in advanced-stage APP/PS1 mice with significant cognitive deficits. In mice at both disease stages, sleep-related delta power percentage correlated positively with memory performance. At early stage, memory performance correlated positively with sympathetic activity during wakefulness; at advanced stage, memory performance correlated positively with parasympathetic activity during both wakefulness and sleep. In conclusion, sleep quality and distinction between wake- and sleep-related autonomic function may be biomarkers for early AD detection.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Mice, Transgenic; Alzheimer Disease; Primary Dysautonomias; Sleep; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Chen, CW; Kwok, YT; Cheng, YT; Huang, YS; Kuo, TBJ; Wu, CH; Du, PJ; Yang, AC; Yang, CCH"

Resting-state EEG signatures of Alzheimer's disease are driven by periodic but not aperiodic changes.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasise the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",2023,,,"Kopčanová, M; Tait, L; Donoghue, T; Stothart, G; Smith, L; Sandoval, AAF; Davila-Perez, P; Buss, S; Shafi, MM; Pascual-Leone, A; Fried, PJ; Benwell, CSY"

Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Speech and language changes occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few studies have characterized their longitudinal course.

Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change.

Integrative metabolomics science in Alzheimer's disease: Relevance and future perspectives.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is determined by various pathophysiological mechanisms starting 10-25 years before the onset of clinical symptoms. As multiple functionally interconnected molecular/cellular pathways appear disrupted in AD, the exploitation of high-throughput unbiased omics sciences is critical to elucidating the precise pathogenesis of AD. Among different omics, metabolomics is a fast-growing discipline allowing for the simultaneous detection and quantification of hundreds/thousands of perturbed metabolites in tissues or biofluids, reproducing the fluctuations of multiple networks affected by a disease. Here, we seek to critically depict the main metabolomics methodologies with the aim of identifying new potential AD biomarkers and further elucidating AD pathophysiological mechanisms. From a systems biology perspective, as metabolic alterations can occur before the development of clinical signs, metabolomics - coupled with existing accessible biomarkers used for AD screening and diagnosis - can support early disease diagnosis and help develop individualized treatment plans. Presently, the majority of metabolomic analyses emphasized that lipid metabolism is the most consistently altered pathway in AD pathogenesis. The possibility that metabolomics may reveal crucial steps in AD pathogenesis is undermined by the difficulty in discriminating between the causal or epiphenomenal or compensatory nature of metabolic findings.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amino acids; Biomarkers; Lipids; Metabolomics; Systems biology,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Metabolomics; Metabolome; Biomarkers,"Lista, S; González-Domínguez, R; López-Ortiz, S; González-Domínguez, Á; Menéndez, H; Martín-Hernández, J; Lucia, A; Emanuele, E; Centonze, D; Imbimbo, BP; Triaca, V; Lionetto, L; Simmaco, M; Cuperlovic-Culf, M; Mill, J; Li, L; Mapstone, M; Santos-Lozano, A; Nisticò, R"

Normative data for COGITAB: An Italian tablet-based test battery conceived for the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease.,"The number of people with dementia is increasing worldwide.

Model-Driven Dementia Prevention and Intervention Platform.,"Most types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, are not curable. However, there are risk factors, such as obesity or hypertension, that can promote the development of dementia. Holistic treatment of these risk factors can prevent the onset of dementia or delay it in its early stages. To support individualized treatment of risk factors in dementia, this paper presents a model-driven digital platform. It enables monitoring of biomarkers using smart devices from the internet of medical things (IoMT) for the target group. The collected data from such devices can be used to optimize and adjust treatment in a patient in the loop manner. To this end, providers such as Google Fit and Withings have been connected to the platform as example data sources. To achieve treatment and monitoring data interoperability with existing medical systems, internationally accepted standards such as FHIR are used. The configuration and control of the personalized treatment processes are achieved using a self-developed domain-specific language. For this language, an associated diagram editor was implemented, which allows the management of the treatment processes through graphical models. This graphical representation should help treatment providers to understand and manage these processes more easily. To investigate this hypothesis, a usability study was conducted with twelve participants. We were able to show that such graphical representations provide advantages in clarity in reviewing the system, but lack in easy set-up (compared to wizard-style systems).",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; FHIR; IoMT; digital prevention; internet of medical things; model-driven intervention planning; precision care; treatment platform,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Language; Data Collection; Palliative Care,"Schinle, M; Dietrich, M; Stock, S; Gerdes, M; Stork, W"
Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice and trials.,"Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials.

Déjà vécu with recollective confabulation: an unusual presentation of Alzheimer's disease.,"A man in his 80s presented with gradual onset of a persistent and delusion-like perception that novel encounters are repetitions of previous experiences. Within 2 years of symptom onset, he had impaired verbal memory and executive dysfunction on neuropsychological assessment. Cerebrospinal fluid core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers analysis supported probable AD. Generalised and left temporal atrophy was seen on MRI of the brain. Neurological fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed left temporal and bilateral frontal lobe hypometabolism. His presenting symptom is known as déjà vécu with recollective confabulation, a rare phenomenon associated with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. While several potential mechanisms have been previously proposed, the fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT hypometabolism in the temporal and frontal lobes in this case suggests dual deficits in recognition memory and metacognition may be culprit mechanisms.

Remote Digital Technologies for the Early Detection and Monitoring of Cognitive Decline in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Insights From Studies of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a risk factor for cognitive decline. In neurodegenerative disease research, remote digital cognitive assessments and unobtrusive sensors are gaining traction for their potential to improve early detection and monitoring of cognitive impairment. Given the high prevalence of cognitive impairments in T2D, these digital tools are highly relevant. Further research incorporating remote digital biomarkers of cognition, behavior, and motor functioning may enable comprehensive characterizations of patients with T2D and may ultimately improve clinical care and equitable access to research participation. The aim of this commentary article is to review the feasibility, validity, and limitations of using remote digital cognitive tests and unobtrusive detection methods to identify and monitor cognitive decline in neurodegenerative conditions and apply these insights to patients with T2D.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cognitive decline; digital biomarkers; health technology; mild cognitive impairment; type 2 diabetes,,"DuBord, AY; Paolillo, EW; Staffaroni, AM"

A scoping review of neurodegenerative manifestations in explainable digital phenotyping.,"Neurologists nowadays no longer view neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, as single entities, but rather as a spectrum of multifaceted symptoms with heterogeneous progression courses and treatment responses. The definition of the naturalistic behavioral repertoire of early neurodegenerative manifestations is still elusive, impeding early diagnosis and intervention. Central to this view is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in reinforcing the depth of phenotypic information, thereby supporting the paradigm shift to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. This suggestion advocates the definition of disease subtypes in a new biomarker-supported nosology framework, yet without empirical consensus on standardization, reliability and interpretability. Although the well-defined neurodegenerative processes, linked to a triad of motor and non-motor preclinical symptoms, are detected by clinical intuition, we undertake an unbiased data-driven approach to identify different patterns of neuropathology distribution based on the naturalistic behavior data inherent to populations in-the-wild. We appraise the role of remote technologies in the definition of digital phenotyping specific to brain-, body- and social-level neurodegenerative subtle symptoms, emphasizing inter- and intra-patient variability powered by deep learning. As such, the present review endeavors to exploit digital technologies and AI to create disease-specific phenotypic explanations, facilitating the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases as ""bio-psycho-social"" conditions. Not only does this translational effort within explainable digital phenotyping foster the understanding of disease-induced traits, but it also enhances diagnostic and, eventually, treatment personalization.",2023,,,"Alfalahi, H; Dias, SB; Khandoker, AH; Chaudhuri, KR; Hadjileontiadis, LJ"
Seed amplification and neurodegeneration marker trajectories in individuals at risk of prion disease.,"Human prion diseases are remarkable for long incubation times followed typically by rapid clinical decline. Seed amplification assays and neurodegeneration biofluid biomarkers are remarkably useful in the clinical phase, but their potential to predict clinical onset in healthy people remains unclear. This is relevant not only to the design of preventive strategies in those at-risk of prion diseases, but more broadly, because prion-like mechanisms are thought to underpin many neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report the accrual of a longitudinal biofluid resource in patients, controls and healthy people at risk of prion diseases, to which ultrasensitive techniques such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and single molecule array (Simoa) digital immunoassays were applied for preclinical biomarker discovery. We studied 648 CSF and plasma samples, including 16 people who had samples taken when healthy but later developed inherited prion disease (IPD) ('converters'; range from 9.9 prior to, and 7.4 years after onset). Symptomatic IPD CSF samples were screened by RT-QuIC assay variations, before testing the entire collection of at-risk samples using the most sensitive assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), tau and UCH-L1 levels were measured in plasma and CSF. Second generation (IQ-CSF) RT-QuIC proved 100% sensitive and specific for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), iatrogenic and familial CJD phenotypes, and subsequently detected seeding activity in four presymptomatic CSF samples from three E200K carriers; one converted in under 2 months while two remain asymptomatic after at least 3 years' follow-up. A bespoke HuPrP P102L RT-QuIC showed partial sensitivity for P102L disease. No compatible RT-QuIC assay was discovered for classical 6-OPRI, A117V and D178N, and these at-risk samples tested negative with bank vole RT-QuIC. Plasma GFAP and NfL, and CSF NfL levels emerged as proximity markers of neurodegeneration in the typically slow IPDs (e.g. P102L), with significant differences in mean values segregating healthy control from IPD carriers (within 2 years to onset) and symptomatic IPD cohorts; plasma GFAP appears to change before NfL, and before clinical conversion. In conclusion, we show distinct biomarker trajectories in fast and slow IPDs. Specifically, we identify several years of presymptomatic seeding positivity in E200K, a new proximity marker (plasma GFAP) and sequential neurodegenerative marker evolution (plasma GFAP followed by NfL) in slow IPDs. We suggest a new preclinical staging system featuring clinical, seeding and neurodegeneration aspects, for validation with larger prion at-risk cohorts, and with potential application to other neurodegenerative proteopathies.",2023,GFAP; NfL; RT-QuIC; inherited; prion,Humans; tau Proteins; Prion Diseases; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Prions; Biomarkers,"Mok, TH; Nihat, A; Majbour, N; Sequeira, D; Holm-Mercer, L; Coysh, T; Darwent, L; Batchelor, M; Groveman, BR; Orr, CD; Hughson, AG; Heslegrave, A; Laban, R; Veleva, E; Paterson, RW; Keshavan, A; Schott, JM; Swift, IJ; Heller, C; Rohrer, JD; Gerhard, A; Butler, C; Rowe, JB; Masellis, M; Chapman, M; Lunn, MP; Bieschke, J; Jackson, GS; Zetterberg, H; Caughey, B; Rudge, P; Collinge, J; Mead, S"

Early amygdala and ERC atrophy linked to 3D reconstruction of rostral neurofibrillary tau tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Previous research has emphasized the unique impact of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a reflection that tau pathology is particularly striking in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortex (ERC, TEC) early in the course of disease. However, other brain regions are affected by AD pathology during its early phases. Here, we use longitudinal diffeomorphometry to measure the atrophy rate from MRI of the amygdala compared with that in the ERC and TEC in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls, CU individuals who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with MCI who progressed to dementia of the AD type (DAT), using a dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results show significantly higher atrophy rates of the amygdala in both groups of 'converters' (CU→MCI, MCI→DAT) compared to controls, with rates of volume loss comparable to rates of thickness loss in the ERC and TEC. We localize atrophy within the amygdala within each of these groups using fixed effects modeling. Controlling for the familywise error rate highlights the medial regions of the amygdala as those with significantly higher atrophy in both groups of converters than in controls. Using our recently developed method, referred to as Projective LDDMM, we map measures of neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) from digital pathology to MRI atlases and reconstruct dense 3D spatial distributions of NFT density within regions of the MTL. The distribution of NFTs is consistent with the spatial distribution of MR measured atrophy rates, revealing high densities (and atrophy) in the amygdala (particularly medial), ERC, and rostral third of the MTL. The similarity of the location of NFTs in AD and shape changes in a well-defined clinical population suggests that amygdalar atrophy rate, as measured through MRI may be a viable biomarker for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amygdala atrophy; Digital pathology; MRI biomarkers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Temporal Lobe; Amygdala; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Atrophy; Cognitive Dysfunction","Stouffer, KM; Chen, C; Kulason, S; Xu, E; Witter, MP; Ceritoglu, C; Albert, MS; Mori, S; Troncoso, J; Tward, DJ; Miller, MI"
The localization of molecularly distinct microglia populations to Alzheimer's disease pathologies using QUIVER.,"New histological techniques are needed to examine protein distribution in human tissues, which can reveal cell shape and disease pathology connections. Spatial proteomics has changed the study of tumor microenvironments by identifying spatial relationships of immunomodulatory cells and proteins and contributing to the discovery of new cancer immunotherapy biomarkers. However, the fast-expanding toolkit of spatial proteomic approaches has yet to be systematically applied to investigate pathological alterations in the aging human brain in health and disease states. Moreover, post-mortem human brain tissue presents distinct technical problems due to fixation procedures and autofluorescence, which limit fluorescence methodologies. This study sought to develop a multiplex immunohistochemistry approach (visualizing the immunostain with brightfield microscopy). Quantitative multiplex Immunohistochemistry with Visual colorimetric staining to Enhance Regional protein localization (QUIVER) was developed to address these technical challenges. Using QUIVER, a ten-channel pseudo-fluorescent image was generated using chromogen removal and digital microscopy to identify unique molecular microglia phenotypes. Next, the study asked if the tissue environment, specifically the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, has any bearing on microglia's cellular and molecular phenotypes. QUIVER allowed the visualization of five molecular microglia/macrophage phenotypes using digital pathology tools. The recognizable reactive and homeostatic microglia/macrophage phenotypes demonstrated spatial polarization towards and away from amyloid plaques, respectively. Yet, microglia morphology appearance did not always correspond to molecular phenotype. This research not only sheds light on the biology of microglia but also offers QUIVER, a new tool for examining pathological alterations in the brains of the elderly.",2023,Digital pathology; Glia; Histology; Multiplexed tissue imaging; Neurodegenerative disease; Neuropathology; Single-cell analysis,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Microglia; Plaque, Amyloid; Proteomics; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Brain; Tremor; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Shahidehpour, RK; Nelson, AS; Sanders, LG; Embry, CR; Nelson, PT; Bachstetter, AD"

A New Smart 2-Min Mobile Alerting Method for Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease in the Community.,"The early identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), in an early stage of AD can expand the AD warning window. We propose a new capability index evaluating the spatial execution process (SEP), which can dynamically evaluate the execution process in the space navigation task. The hypothesis is proposed that there are neurobehavioral differences between normal cognitive (NC) elderly and AD patients with MCI reflected in digital biomarkers captured during SEP. According to this, we designed a new smart 2-min mobile alerting method for MCI due to AD, for community screening. Two digital biomarkers, total mission execution distance (METRtotal) and execution distance above the transverse obstacle (EDabove), were selected by step-up regression analysis. For the participants with more than 9 years of education, the alerting efficiency of the combination of the two digital biomarkers for MCI due to AD could reach 0.83. This method has the advantages of fast speed, high alerting efficiency, low cost and high intelligence and thus has a high application value for community screening in developing countries. It also provides a new intelligent alerting approach based on the human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigm for MCI due to AD in community screening.",2023,alerting in the community; digital biomarkers; mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease; spatial execution process,,"Wang, Y; Chen, T; Wang, C; Ogihara, A; Ma, X; Huang, S; Zhou, S; Li, S; Liu, J; Li, K"

Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers with Crossmodal Augmentation.,"Mild cognitive impairment is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. Its detection has been a critical task for establishing cohort studies and developing therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's. Various types of markers have been developed for detection. For example, imaging markers from neuroimaging have shown great sensitivity, while its cost is still prohibitive for large-scale screening of early dementia. Recent advances from digital biomarkers, such as language markers, have provided an accessible and affordable alternative. While imaging markers give anatomical descriptions of the brain, language markers capture the behavior characteristics of early dementia subjects. Such differences suggest the benefits of auxiliary information from the imaging modality to improve the predictive power of unimodal predictive models based on language markers alone. However, one significant barrier to the joint analysis is that in typical cohorts, there are only very limited subjects that have both imaging and language modalities. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we develop a novel crossmodal augmentation tool, which leverages auxiliary imaging information to improve the feature space of language markers so that a subject with only language markers can benefit from imaging information through the augmentation. Our experimental results show that the multi-modal predictive model trained with language markers and auxiliary imaging information significantly outperforms unimodal predictive models.",2023,,Humans; Computational Biology; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Language; Disease Progression,"Liu, G; Xue, Z; Zhan, L; Dodge, HH; Zhou, J"
Distributional data analysis via quantile functions and its application to modeling digital biomarkers of gait in Alzheimer's Disease.,"With the advent of continuous health monitoring with wearable devices, users now generate their unique streams of continuous data such as minute-level step counts or heartbeats. Summarizing these streams via scalar summaries often ignores the distributional nature of wearable data and almost unavoidably leads to the loss of critical information. We propose to capture the distributional nature of wearable data via user-specific quantile functions (QF) and use these QFs as predictors in scalar-on-quantile-function-regression (SOQFR). As an alternative approach, we also propose to represent QFs via user-specific L-moments, robust rank-based analogs of traditional moments, and use L-moments as predictors in SOQFR (SOQFR-L). These two approaches provide two mutually consistent interpretations: in terms of quantile levels by SOQFR and in terms of L-moments by SOQFR-L. We also demonstrate how to deal with multi-modal distributional data via Joint and Individual Variation Explained using L-moments. The proposed methods are illustrated in a study of association of digital gait biomarkers with cognitive function in Alzheimers disease. Our analysis shows that the proposed methods demonstrate higher predictive performance and attain much stronger associations with clinical cognitive scales compared to simple distributional summaries.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Gait; JIVE; L-Moments; Quantile functions; Scalar-on-quantile-function regression; Wearable data,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gait; Wearable Electronic Devices; Data Analysis,"Ghosal, R; Varma, VR; Volfson, D; Hillel, I; Urbanek, J; Hausdorff, JM; Watts, A; Zipunnikov, V"

Associations between near end-of-life flortaucipir PET and postmortem CTE-related tau neuropathology in six former American football players.,Flourine-18-flortaucipir tau positron emission tomography (PET) was developed for the detection for Alzheimer's disease. Human imaging studies have begun to investigate its use in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Flortaucipir-PET to autopsy correlation studies in CTE are needed for diagnostic validation. We examined the association between end-of-life flortaucipir PET and postmortem neuropathological measurements of CTE-related tau in six former American football players.,2023,Biomarkers; Chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Flortaucipir; Football; Neurodegenerative disease; Positron emission tomography imaging; Repetitive head impacts; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Autopsy; Brain; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy; Death; Football; Positron-Emission Tomography; tau Proteins","Alosco, ML; Su, Y; Stein, TD; Protas, H; Cherry, JD; Adler, CH; Balcer, LJ; Bernick, C; Pulukuri, SV; Abdolmohammadi, B; Coleman, MJ; Palmisano, JN; Tripodis, Y; Mez, J; Rabinovici, GD; Marek, KL; Beach, TG; Johnson, KA; Huber, BR; Koerte, I; Lin, AP; Bouix, S; Cummings, JL; Shenton, ME; Reiman, EM; McKee, AC; Stern, RA"
"Unsupervised high-frequency smartphone-based cognitive assessments are reliable, valid, and feasible in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.","Smartphones have the potential for capturing subtle changes in cognition that characterize preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults. The Ambulatory Research in Cognition (ARC) smartphone application is based on principles from ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and administers brief tests of associative memory, processing speed, and working memory up to 4 times per day over 7 consecutive days. ARC was designed to be administered unsupervised using participants' personal devices in their everyday environments.",2023,digital biomarkers; ecological momentary assessment; mobile testing; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Reproducibility of Results; Cognition; Biomarkers; Positron-Emission Tomography; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Nicosia, J; Aschenbrenner, AJ; Balota, DA; Sliwinski, MJ; Tahan, M; Adams, S; Stout, SS; Wilks, H; Gordon, BA; Benzinger, TLS; Fagan, AM; Xiong, C; Bateman, RJ; Morris, JC; Hassenstab, J"
Examining the association between blood-based biomarkers and human post mortem neuropathology in the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center autopsy cohort.,"Clinically, detection of disease-causing pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is limited to magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scans, which are expensive and not widely accessible.
