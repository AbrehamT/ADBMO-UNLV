"PEMOCS: Evaluating the effects of a concept-guided, PErsonalised, MOtor-Cognitive exergame training on cognitive functions and gait in chronic Stroke-study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","Many stroke survivors remain with residual cognitive and motor impairments despite receiving timely acute and sub-acute rehabilitation. This indicates that rehabilitation following stroke should be continuous to meet the needs of individual stroke patients. Both cognitive and motor functions are essential for mastering daily life and, therefore, should be aimed at with rehabilitation. Exergames, motor-cognitive exercises performed using video games, are an auspicious method to train both motor and cognitive functions and at the same time may foster the long-term motivation for training. This study aims to assess the effect of concept-guided, personalised, motor-cognitive exergame training on cognitive and motor functions in chronic stroke survivors.",2024,Cognition; Gait; Gaming; Mobility; Protocol; Rehabilitation; Stroke; Training; Virtual reality,Humans; Stroke Rehabilitation; Video Games; Cognition; Single-Blind Method; Gait; Stroke; Exercise Therapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Chronic Disease; Treatment Outcome; Recovery of Function; Time Factors; Female; Male,"Huber, SK; Knols, RH; Held, JPO; Betschart, M; de Bruin, ED"
Heart rate variability modulates memory function in a virtual task.,"Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered one of the most relevant indicators of physical well-being and relevant biomarker for preventing cardiovascular risks. More recently, a growing amount of research has tracked an association between HRV and cognitive functions (i.e., attention). Research is still scarce on spatial orientation, a basic capability in our daily lives. It is also an important indicator of memory performance, and its malfunctioning working as an early sign of dementia. In this study, a total of 43 female students (M Age = 18.76; SD = 2.02) were measured in their lnRMSSD using the photoplethysmography technique with the Welltory smartphone app. They were also tested in their spatial memory with The Boxes Room, a virtual navigation test. Measures of physical activity were obtained with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Correlation analyses and repeated measures ANOVA were performed, comparing participants with high / low lnRMSSD in their spatial performance. Results showed that, at an equal level of physical activity, participants with a higher lnRMSSD were more effective in the early trials of The Boxes Room, being more precise in estimating the correct position of the stimuli. Moreover, a subsequent simple linear regression showed that a higher lnRMSSD was related to a smaller number of errors at the beginning of the spatial task. Overly, these results outline the relationship between HRV and navigation performance in early stages of processing, where the environment is still unknown and the situation is more demanding.",2024,Cardiology; Hippocampus; Navigation; Physical activity; Spatial orientation,Humans; Female; Heart Rate; Young Adult; Adolescent; Virtual Reality; Photoplethysmography; Spatial Memory; Spatial Navigation; Exercise; Memory,"Castillo-Escamilla, J; Ruffo, I; Carrasco-Poyatos, M; Granero-Gallegos, A; Cimadevilla, JM"
Effects of computerized cognitive training on biomarker responses in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A scoping review.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a widespread condition in older individuals, posing significant risk of dementia. However, limited research has been conducted to explore effective interventions and clarify their impact at the neural level. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of computerized cognitive training (CCT) and explore the associated neural mechanisms in preventing dementia in older individuals with MCI, with a view to inform future intervention efforts.",2024,biomarker; brain‐derived neurotrophic factor; computerized cognitive training; electroencephalography; functional near‐infrared spectroscopy; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment,,"Hayashi, H; Sone, T; Iokawa, K; Sumigawa, K; Fujita, T; Kawamata, H; Asao, A; Kawasaki, I; Ogasawara, M; Kawakatsu, S"
Exploring the Relationship between Behavioral and Neurological Impairments Due to Mild Cognitive Impairment: Correlation Study between Virtual Kiosk Test and EEG-SSVEP.,"Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease, making early screening imperative for potential intervention and prevention of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, there is a demand for research to identify effective and easy-to-use tools for aMCI screening. While behavioral tests in virtual reality environments have successfully captured behavioral features related to instrumental activities of daily living for aMCI screening, further investigations are necessary to establish connections between cognitive decline and neurological changes. Utilizing electroencephalography with steady-state visual evoked potentials, this study delved into the correlation between behavioral features recorded during virtual reality tests and neurological features obtained by measuring neural activity in the dorsal stream. As a result, this multimodal approach achieved an impressive screening accuracy of 98.38%.",2024,brain–computer interface; human cognition; instrumental activities of daily living; steady-state visual evoked potentials; virtual reality,"Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Electroencephalography; Aged; Male; Female; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Virtual Reality; Alzheimer Disease; Neuropsychological Tests; Activities of Daily Living; Middle Aged","Kim, D; Kim, Y; Park, J; Choi, H; Ryu, H; Loeser, M; Seo, K"
Exergaming and cognitive functions in people with mild cognitive impairment and dementia: a meta-analysis.,"Exergaming is a combination of exercise and gaming. Evidence shows an association between exercise and cognition in older people. However, previous studies showed inconsistent results on the cognitive benefits of exergaming in people with cognitive impairment. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of exergaming intervention on cognitive functions in people with MCI or dementia. A systematic literature search was conducted via OVID databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined the effect of an exergaming intervention on cognitive functions in people with MCI or dementia were included. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the type of intervention and training duration. Twenty RCTs with 1152 participants were identified, including 14 trials for MCI and 6 trials for dementia. In people with MCI, 13 studies used virtual-reality (VR)-based exergaming. Those who received VR-based exergaming showed significantly better global cognitive function [SMD (95%CI) = 0.67 (0.23-1.11)], learning and memory [immediate recall test: 0.79 (0.31-1.27); delayed recall test: 0.75 (0.20-1.31)], working memory [5.83 (2.27-9.39)], verbal fluency [0.58 (0.12-1.03)], and faster in executive function than the controls. For people with dementia, all studies used video-based exergaming intervention. Participants with exergaming intervention showed significantly better global cognitive function than the controls [0.38 (0.10-0.67)]. Subgroup analyses showed that longer training duration generated larger effects. The findings suggest that exergaming impacts cognitive functions in people with MCI and dementia. Cognitive benefits are demonstrated for those with a longer training duration. With technological advancement, VR-based exergaming attracts the attention of people with MCI and performs well in improving cognitive functions.",2024,,,"Chan, JYC; Liu, J; Chan, ATC; Tsoi, KKF"

Acceptability of virtual reality to screen for dementia in older adults.,"Early detection of dementia and cognitive decline is crucial for effective interventions and overall wellbeing. Although virtual reality (VR) tools offer potential advantages to traditional dementia screening tools, there is a lack of knowledge regarding older adults' acceptance of VR tools, as well as the predictors and features influencing their adoption. This study aims to (i) explore older adults' perceptions of the acceptability and usefulness of VR diagnostic tools for dementia, and (ii) identify demographic predictors of adoption and features of VR applications that contribute to future adoption among older adults.",2024,Acceptability; Cognition digital health; Older adults; Virtual reality,"Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Dementia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Virtual Reality; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Mass Screening; Independent Living","Siette, J; Adam, PJ; Harris, CB"
Multidimensional assessment of social cognition using non-immersive virtual reality in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease: an exploratory study.,"Few studies have focused on social cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), even though some brain structures being well known as underlying social cognitive processes are directly impacted in this disease. Furthermore, social cognition processes have been mostly studied independently using evaluations with poor ecological validity.

Differential disruptions in population coding along the dorsal-ventral axis of CA1 in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Aβ pathology.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by a range of behavioral alterations, including memory loss and psychiatric symptoms. While there is evidence that molecular pathologies, such as amyloid beta (Aβ), contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology gives rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis is that Aβ exerts differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the neurophysiology and connectivity of different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), two hippocampal areas known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in the APP/PS1 mouse model of amyloidosis. Despite similar levels of Aβ pathology, dCA1 and vCA1 showed distinct disruptions in neuronal population activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dCA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in APP/PS1 mice relative to age-matched C57BL/6 controls. However, in vCA1, APP/PS1 mice had increased pair-wise correlations and entropy as compared to age matched controls. Finally, using maximum entropy models, we connected the microscopic features of population activity (correlations) to the macroscopic features of the population code (entropy). We found that the models' performance increased in predicting dCA1 activity, but decreased in predicting vCA1 activity, in APP/PS1 mice relative to the controls. Taken together, we found that Aβ exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions, suggesting that the various behavioral deficits of AD may reflect underlying heterogeneities in neuronal circuits and the different disruptions that Aβ pathology causes in those circuits.",2024,,"Animals; Male; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; Computational Biology; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Neurons; Presenilin-1","Chockanathan, U; Padmanabhan, K"
Bodily and Visual-Cognitive Navigation Aids to Enhance Spatial Recall in Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) syndrome often report navigation difficulties, accompanied by impairments in egocentric and allocentric spatial memory.

Integrating Biomarkers From Virtual Reality and Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using a Multimodal Learning Approach: Validation Study.,"Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer disease, is crucial for preventing the progression of dementia. Virtual reality (VR) biomarkers have proven to be effective in capturing behaviors associated with subtle deficits in instrumental activities of daily living, such as challenges in using a food-ordering kiosk, for early detection of MCI. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers have demonstrated their efficacy in quantifying observable structural brain changes that can aid in early MCI detection. Nevertheless, the relationship between VR-derived and MRI biomarkers remains an open question. In this context, we explored the integration of VR-derived and MRI biomarkers to enhance early MCI detection through a multimodal learning approach.",2024,MRI; VR; early detection; eye movement; hand movement; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment; multimodal learning; virtual reality,Humans; Aged; Activities of Daily Living; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Virtual Reality,"Park, B; Kim, Y; Park, J; Choi, H; Kim, SE; Ryu, H; Seo, K"
Virtual rehabilitation for patients with osteoporosis or other musculoskeletal disorders: a systematic review.,"This study aims to identify effective ways to design virtual rehabilitation to obtain physical improvement (e.g. balance and gait) and support engagement (i.e. motivation) for people with osteoporosis or other musculoskeletal disorders. Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder and is among the most prevalent diseases globally, affecting 0.5 billion adults. Despite the fact that the number of people with osteoporosis is similar to, or greater than those diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and dementia, osteoporosis does not receive the same recognition. Worldwide, osteoporosis causes 8.9 million fractures annually; it is associated with substantial pain, suffering, disability and increased mortality. The importance of physical therapy as a rehabilitation strategy to avoid osteoporosis fracture cannot be over-emphasised. However, the main rehabilitation challenges relate to engagement and participation. The use of virtual rehabilitation to address such challenges in the delivery of physical improvement is gaining in popularity. As there currently is a paucity of literature applying virtual rehabilitation to patients with osteoporosis, the authors broadened the search parameters to include articles relating to the virtual rehabilitation of other skeletal disorders (e.g. Ankylosing spondylitis, spinal cord injury, motor rehabilitation, etc.). This systematic review initially identified 130 titles, from which 23 articles (involving 539 participants) met all eligibility and selection criteria. Four groups of devices supporting virtual rehabilitation were identified: a head-mounted display, a balance board, a camera and more specific devices. Each device supported physical improvement (i.e. balance, muscle strength and gait) post-training. This review has shown that: (a) each device allowed improvement with different degrees of immersion, (b) the technology choice is dependent on the care need and (c) virtual rehabilitation can be equivalent to and enhance conventional therapy and potentially increase the patient's engagement with physical therapy.",2024,Exergames; Musculoskeletal disorders; Osteoporosis; Patient engagement; VR/AR; Virtual rehabilitation for older adults,,"Thuilier, E; Carey, J; Dempsey, M; Dingliana, J; Whelan, B; Brennan, A"
"Physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and cognitive function among older adults: A bibliometric analysis from 2004 to 2024.","Because of population ageing, there will be a vast increase in the prevalence of cognitive decline and dementia. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour have been identified as modifiable lifestyle behaviours associated with these cognitive conditions. Therefore, the aim of this bibliometric analysis is to reveal the knowledge structure of the field of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and cognitive function among older adults from 2004 to 2024, and to predict emerging research trends. A total of 1290 publications were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were applied to conduct performance analysis, science mapping, and enrichment. T. Liu-Ambrose was the most prolific author (39 publications), and the University of British Columbia was the most prolific institution (48 publications). The USA, China, and Canada were the three most productive countries with 392, 174, and 136 publications respectively. Two research trends revealed the knowledge structure of this field, including the shift from evaluating the effectiveness of interventions on cognitive function to evaluating the effectiveness of interventions on other health-related outcomes, as well as an expansion of research on the role of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the context of healthy ageing. Sleep, sedentary behaviour, and virtual reality may be emerging research trends and may predict directions for future research.

Sensory Integration: A Novel Approach for Healthy Ageing and Dementia Management.,"Sensory processing is a fundamental aspect of the nervous system that plays a pivotal role in the cognitive decline observed in older individuals with dementia. The ""sensory diet"", derived from sensory integration theory, may provide a tailored approach to modulating sensory experiences and triggering neuroplastic changes in the brain in individuals with dementia. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate the current knowledge regarding the sensory diet and its potential application to dementia. This review encompassed an extensive search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, covering articles published from 2010 to 2023. Keywords such as ""sensory integration"", ""sensory modulation"", ""healthy aging"", and ""dementia"" were utilized to identify relevant studies. The types of materials retrieved included peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, ensuring a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape. This article offers a comprehensive exploration of the effectiveness of sensory diets such as tactile stimulation, auditory therapies, and visual interventions, which have demonstrated noteworthy efficacy in addressing challenges linked to aging and dementia. Research findings consistently report positive outcomes, such as improved cognitive function, elevated emotional well-being, and enhanced overall quality of life in older individuals. Furthermore, we found that the integration of sensory diets with the metaverse, augmented reality, and virtual reality opens up personalized experiences, fostering cognitive stimulation and emotional well-being for individuals during aging. Therefore, we conclude that customized sensory diets, based on interdisciplinary cooperation and leveraging technological advancements, are effective in optimizing sensory processing and improve the overall well-being of older individuals contending with sensory modulation challenges and dementia.",2024,dementia; healthy aging; neuromodulation; sensory integration,,"Maneemai, O; Cujilan Alvarado, MC; Calderon Intriago, LG; Donoso Triviño, AJ; Franco Coffré, JA; Pratico, D; Schwartz, K; Tesfaye, T; Yamasaki, T"
Development of a new computer simulated environment to screen cognition: assessing the feasibility and acceptability of Leaf Café in younger and older adults.,"Existing traditional cognitive screening tools for dementia have various limitations, including overreliance on tests assessing verbal memory and, to a lesser extent, on some aspects of executive functioning. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment is sensitive to impairment but time-intensive and expensive. Virtual reality may provide a dynamic and unique understanding of cognitive performance and increase the ecological validity of cognitive assessment. The use of virtual reality in screening for cognitive function in older persons is promising, but evidence for its use remains sparse.",2024,Cognition; Dementia; Performance; Screening; Technology; Virtual reality,"Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feasibility Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Neuropsychological Tests","Siette, J; Guion, J; Ijaz, K; Strutt, P; Porte, M; Savage, G; Richards, D"
Numerosity estimation of virtual humans as a digital-robotic marker for hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.,"Hallucinations are frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with dementia and higher mortality. Despite their high clinical relevance, current assessments of hallucinations are based on verbal self-reports and interviews that are limited by important biases. Here, we used virtual reality (VR), robotics, and digital online technology to quantify presence hallucination (vivid sensations that another person is nearby when no one is actually present and can neither be seen nor heard) in laboratory and home-based settings. We establish that elevated numerosity estimation of virtual human agents in VR is a digital marker for experimentally induced presence hallucinations in healthy participants, as confirmed across several control conditions and analyses. We translated the digital marker (numerosity estimation) to an online procedure that 170 PD patients carried out remotely at their homes, revealing that PD patients with disease-related presence hallucinations (but not control PD patients) showed higher numerosity estimation. Numerosity estimation enables quantitative monitoring of hallucinations, is an easy-to-use unobtrusive online method, reaching people far away from medical centers, translating neuroscientific findings using robotics and VR, to patients' homes without specific equipment or trained staff.",2024,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Hallucinations,"Albert, L; Potheegadoo, J; Herbelin, B; Bernasconi, F; Blanke, O"
Performance of digital technologies in assessing fall risks among older adults with cognitive impairment: a systematic review.,"Older adults with cognitive impairment (CI) are twice as likely to fall compared to the general older adult population. Traditional fall risk assessments may not be suitable for older adults with CI due to their reliance on attention and recall. Hence, there is an interest in using objective technology-based fall risk assessment tools to assess falls within this population. This systematic review aims to evaluate the features and performance of technology-based fall risk assessment tools for older adults with CI. A systematic search was conducted across several databases such as PubMed and IEEE Xplore, resulting in the inclusion of 22 studies. Most studies focused on participants with dementia. The technologies included sensors, mobile applications, motion capture, and virtual reality. Fall risk assessments were conducted in the community, laboratory, and institutional settings; with studies incorporating continuous monitoring of older adults in everyday environments. Studies used a combination of technology-based inputs of gait parameters, socio-demographic indicators, and clinical assessments. However, many missed the opportunity to include cognitive performance inputs as predictors to fall risk. The findings of this review support the use of technology-based fall risk assessment tools for older adults with CI. Further advancements incorporating cognitive measures and additional longitudinal studies are needed to improve the effectiveness and clinical applications of these assessment tools. Additional work is also required to compare the performance of existing methods for fall risk assessment, technology-based fall risk assessments, and the combination of these approaches.",2024,Cognitive impairment; Digital technologies; Fall prediction; Falls risk assessment; Older adults,Humans; Aged; Digital Technology; Cognitive Dysfunction; Risk Assessment; Gait,"Koh, V; Xuan, LW; Zhe, TK; Singh, N; B Matchar, D; Chan, A"
Early detection of diseases causing dementia using digital navigation and gait measures: A systematic review of evidence.,"Wearable digital technologies capable of measuring everyday behaviors could improve the early detection of dementia-causing diseases. We conducted two systematic reviews following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to establish the evidence base for measuring navigation and gait, two everyday behaviors affected early in AD and non-AD disorders and not adequately measured in current practice. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies on asymptomatic and early-stage symptomatic individuals at risk of dementia, with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale used to assess bias and evaluate methodological quality. Of 316 navigation and 2086 gait records identified, 27 and 83, respectively, were included in the final sample. We highlight several measures that may identify at-risk individuals, whose quantifiability with different devices mitigates the risk of future technological obsolescence. Beyond navigation and gait, this review also provides the framework for evaluating the evidence base for future digital measures of behaviors considered for early disease detection.",2024,ambulation; digital technology; gait; navigation; preclinical dementia; prodromal dementia; smartphones; virtual reality; wearables,"Humans; Gait; Early Diagnosis; Wearable Electronic Devices; Databases, Factual; Dementia","Čepukaitytė, G; Newton, C; Chan, D"

Path integration deficits are associated with phosphorylated tau accumulation in the entorhinal cortex.,"Alzheimer's disease is a devastating disease that is accompanied by dementia, and its incidence increases with age. However, no interventions have exhibited clear therapeutic effects. We aimed to develop and characterize behavioural tasks that allow the earlier identification of signs preceding dementia that would facilitate the development of preventative and therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease. To this end, we developed a 3D virtual reality task sensitive to the activity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, which is the region that first exhibits neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated path integration (assessed by error distance) in a spatial navigation task sensitive to grid cells in the entorhinal cortex in 177 volunteers, aged 20-89 years, who did not have self-reported dementia. While place memory was intact even in old age, path integration deteriorated with increasing age. To investigate the relationship between neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex and path integration deficit, we examined a mouse model of tauopathy (P301S mutant tau-overexpressing mice; PS19 mice). At 6 months of age, PS19 mice showed a significant accumulation of phosphorylated tau only in the entorhinal cortex, associated with impaired path integration without impairments in spatial cognition. These data are consistent with the idea that path integration deficit is caused by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau in the entorhinal cortex. This method may allow the early identification of individuals likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.",2024,3D virtual reality task; entorhinal cortex; neurofibrillary tangle (NFT); path integration,,"Koike, R; Soeda, Y; Kasai, A; Fujioka, Y; Ishigaki, S; Yamanaka, A; Takaichi, Y; Chambers, JK; Uchida, K; Watanabe, H; Takashima, A"
NeuroAIreh@b: an artificial intelligence-based methodology for personalized and adaptive neurorehabilitation.,"Cognitive impairments are a prevalent consequence of acquired brain injury, dementia, and age-related cognitive decline, hampering individuals' daily functioning and independence, with significant societal and economic implications. While neurorehabilitation represents a promising avenue for addressing these deficits, traditional rehabilitation approaches face notable limitations. First, they lack adaptability, offering one-size-fits-all solutions that may not effectively meet each patient's unique needs. Furthermore, the resource-intensive nature of these interventions, often confined to clinical settings, poses barriers to widespread, cost-effective, and sustained implementation, resulting in suboptimal outcomes in terms of intervention adaptability, intensity, and duration. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces NeuroAIreh@b, an innovative cognitive profiling and training methodology that uses an AI-driven framework to optimize neurorehabilitation prescription. NeuroAIreh@b effectively bridges the gap between neuropsychological assessment and computational modeling, thereby affording highly personalized and adaptive neurorehabilitation sessions. This approach also leverages virtual reality-based simulations of daily living activities to enhance ecological validity and efficacy. The feasibility of NeuroAIreh@b has already been demonstrated through a clinical study with stroke patients employing a tablet-based intervention. The NeuroAIreh@b methodology holds the potential for efficacy studies in large randomized controlled trials in the future.",2023,artificial intelligence in health; knowledge representation and reasoning applications; neurorehabilitation; profile dynamics; stroke; virtual reality-based activities of daily living simulations,,"Faria, AL; Almeida, Y; Branco, D; Câmara, J; Cameirão, M; Ferreira, L; Moreira, A; Paulino, T; Rodrigues, P; Spinola, M; Vilar, M; Bermúdez I Badia, S; Simões, M; Fermé, E"

Applications of Artificial Intelligence in the Neuropsychological Assessment of Dementia: A Systematic Review.,"In the context of advancing healthcare, the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders, particularly Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), pose significant challenges. This review explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in neuropsychological assessment for the early detection and personalized treatment of MCI and AD. The review includes 37 articles that demonstrate that AI could be an useful instrument for optimizing diagnostic procedures, predicting cognitive decline, and outperforming traditional tests. Three main categories of applications are identified: (1) combining neuropsychological assessment with clinical data, (2) optimizing existing test batteries using ML techniques, and (3) employing virtual reality and games to overcome the limitations of traditional tests. Despite advancements, the review highlights a gap in developing tools that simplify the clinician's workflow and underscores the need for explainable AI in healthcare decision making. Future studies should bridge the gap between technical performance measures and practical clinical utility to yield accurate results and facilitate clinicians' roles. The successful integration of AI/ML in predicting dementia onset could reduce global healthcare costs and benefit aging societies.",2024,artificial intelligence; dementia; machine learning; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychological assessment,,"Veneziani, I; Marra, A; Formica, C; Grimaldi, A; Marino, S; Quartarone, A; Maresca, G"

Digital Therapeutics for Improving Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Drugs and Biological Products: Preclinical and Clinical Studies Supporting Development of Drug + Digital Combination Therapies for Chronic Diseases.,"Limitations of pharmaceutical drugs and biologics for chronic diseases (e.g., medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, or inadequate efficacy) can be mitigated by mobile medical apps, known as digital therapeutics (DTx). Authorization of adjunct DTx by the US Food and Drug Administration and draft guidelines on ""prescription drug use-related software"" illustrate opportunities to create drug + digital combination therapies, ultimately leading towards drug-device combination products (DTx has a status of medical devices). Digital interventions (mobile, web-based, virtual reality, and video game applications) demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for people living with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. In the respective animal disease models, preclinical studies on environmental enrichment and other non-pharmacological modalities (physical activity, social interactions, learning, and music) as surrogates for DTx ""active ingredients"" also show improved outcomes.

Enhancing cognitive flexibility and working memory in individuals with mild cognitive impairment: Exploring the impact of virtual reality on daily life activities.,"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serving as a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. This study aimed to explore the impact of virtual reality (VR) on enhancing cognitive flexibility, working memory, and daily life activities. Forty participants diagnosed with MCI were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (N = 20) or a control group (N = 20). Evaluations were at baseline, post-training, and three months post-training using various cognitive assessment tools. Results showed that the VR-based cognitive rehabilitation significantly improved instrumental activities of daily living performance, visual and verbal working memory, and reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. While cognitive flexibility did not exhibit significant improvement, these findings highlight VR interventions as a potential avenue for improving cognitive and functional aspects, and alleviating psychological symptoms in individuals with MCI.

Efficacy of virtual reality technology interventions for cognitive and mental outcomes in older people with cognitive disorders: An umbrella review comprising meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.,"We conducted an umbrella review of virtual reality (VR) technology interventions and cognitive improvement in older adults with cognitive disorders to establish a hierarchy of evidence. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases from database creation to February 2023. We included meta-analyses relevant to our study objectives for the overall review. We assessed the methodological quality according to AMSTAR2, and we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) method to assess the credibility of the evidence. This overall review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023423063). We identified six meta-analyses that included 12 cognitive outcomes, but only memory (Standardized Mean Difference(SMD) = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.49), depression (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI: -1.8 to -0.72), and global cognition (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.66) improved through the VR technology intervention. Using the 95% prediction interval (PI) results, we found that VR technology did not significantly affect the cognitive abilities of people with cognitive decline despite increasing the subject size.

Virtual Reality-Based Education Program for Managing Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia: Development and Feasibility Test.,"This study aims to develop a virtual reality-based education program for managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia for family carers of persons living with dementia and investigate the feasibility for users. The program was developed through literature review, interviews with family carers, surveys, and expert content validity assessment. User feasibility was evaluated quantitatively through a questionnaire on usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction, and qualitatively through participant interviews. The program was produced in two parts, Type 1 and Type 2, consisting of three and six episodes, respectively. Participants showed a high level of satisfaction with overall program scores of 4.28 ± 0.66 and 4.34 ± 0.41 for the two evaluations. Participants also expressed that both programs were helpful, Type 1 for achieving changes in attitude associated with more understanding of persons living with dementia and Type 2 for acquiring coping methods through communication training. Use of the virtual reality device was not inconvenient and was identified as helpful due to the high immersion experience. Results of this study confirmed that family carers had no resistance to education using new technologies such as virtual reality devices and that virtual reality-based education could be effective for training family carers.",2024,,Humans; Feasibility Studies; Virtual Reality; Caregivers; Communication; Dementia,"Cheon, H; Song, JA; Kim, J; Jung, S; Kim, GJ"

Reduced overnight memory consolidation and associated alterations in sleep spindles and slow oscillations in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Spatial navigation critically underlies hippocampal-entorhinal circuit function that is early affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is growing evidence that AD pathophysiology dynamically interacts with the sleep/wake cycle impairing hippocampal memory. To elucidate sleep-dependent consolidation in a cohort of symptomatic AD patients (n = 12, 71.25 ± 2.16 years), we tested hippocampal place learning by means of a virtual reality task and verbal memory by a word-pair association task before and after a night of sleep. Our results show an impaired overnight memory retention in AD compared with controls in the verbal task, together with a significant reduction of sleep spindle activity (i.e., lower amplitude of fast sleep spindles, p = 0.016) and increased duration of the slow oscillation (SO; p = 0.019). Higher spindle density, faster down-to-upstate transitions within SOs, and the time delay between SOs and nested spindles predicted better memory performance in healthy controls but not in AD patients. Our results show that mnemonic processing and memory consolidation in AD is slightly impaired as reflected by dysfunctional oscillatory dynamics and spindle-SO coupling during NonREM sleep. In this translational study based on experimental paradigms in animals and extending previous work in healthy aging and preclinical disease stages, our results in symptomatic AD further deepen the understanding of the memory decline within a bidirectional relationship of sleep and AD pathology.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Hippocampal memory; Sleep-dependent memory consolidation; Spatial navigation; Spindles,Humans; Memory Consolidation; Alzheimer Disease; Polysomnography; Sleep; Memory; Memory Disorders,"Hanert, A; Schönfeld, R; Weber, FD; Nowak, A; Döhring, J; Philippen, S; Granert, O; Burgalossi, A; Born, J; Berg, D; Göder, R; Häussermann, P; Bartsch, T"

Assessing cognitive decline in the aging brain: lessons from rodent and human studies.,"As life expectancy continues to increase worldwide, age-related dysfunction will largely impact our societies in the future. Aging is well established to promote the deterioration of cognitive function and is the primary risk factor for the development of prevalent neurological disorders. Even in the absence of dementia, age-related cognitive decline impacts specific types of memories and brain structures in humans and animal models. Despite this, preclinical and clinical studies that investigate age-related changes in brain physiology often use largely different methods, which hinders the translational potential of findings. This review seeks to integrate what is known about age-related changes in the brain with analogue cognitive tests used in humans and rodent studies, ranging from ""pen and paper"" tests to virtual-reality-based paradigms. Finally, we draw parallels between the behavior paradigms used in research compared to the enrollment into clinical trials that aim to study age-related cognitive decline.",2023,,,"Brito, DVC; Esteves, F; Rajado, AT; Silva, N; Araújo, I; Bragança, J; Castelo-Branco, P; Nóbrega, C"

Overestimation in angular path integration precedes Alzheimer's dementia.,"Path integration (PI) is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but reflects multiple sub-processes that may be differentially sensitive to AD. To characterize these sub-processes, we developed a novel generative linear-angular model of PI (GLAMPI) to fit the inbound paths of healthy elderly participants performing triangle completion, a popular PI task, in immersive virtual reality with real movement. The model fits seven parameters reflecting the encoding, calculation, and production errors associated with inaccuracies in PI. We compared these parameters across younger and older participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), including those with (MCI+) and without (MCI-) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD neuropathology. MCI patients showed overestimation of the angular turn in the outbound path and more variable inbound distances and directions compared with healthy elderly. MCI+ were best distinguished from MCI- patients by overestimation of outbound turns and more variable inbound directions. Our results suggest that overestimation of turning underlies the PI errors seen in patients with early AD, indicating specific neural pathways and diagnostic behaviors for further research.",2023,cognitive neuroscience; computational modeling; entorhinal cortex; grid cells; mild cognitive impairment; navigation; virtual reality,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Castegnaro, A; Ji, Z; Rudzka, K; Chan, D; Burgess, N"
Virtual reality-based simulation intervention for enhancing the empathy of informal caregivers of people with dementia: A mixed-methods systematic review.,"Dementia is a long-term and progressive syndrome that not only influences the person with dementia (PWD) but also the caregiver. However, informal caregivers are not always empathic and understand the symptoms of dementia, leading to destructive caregiving relationships and poor quality of caregiving. VR-based simulation interventions can provide a more realistic and memorable learning experience for caregivers to walk in PWDs' shoes. This review aimed to provide practitioners and researchers with insights on developing and/or adopting an effective VR-based simulation intervention for enhancing the empathy of informal caregivers of PWD. A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies were searched from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library updating. Standard JBI critical appraisal instruments were used for the quality appraisal. A convergent segregated approach was used to synthesize and integrate the data. A total of seven studies were included. Inconsistent quantitative results were reported on the effects of VR-based simulation on empathy enhancement. Significant effects were reported on knowledge of dementia and emotion-focused coping strategies. Two themes were generated from the qualitative studies, including ""Informal caregivers gained better insight into problems encountered by older people with dementia"" and ""Thinking from the perspective of older people with dementia, leading to changes in attitudes and behaviours towards dementia"". The qualitative synthesized evidence showed that informal caregivers gained better insight into problems encountered by PWD, but the quantitative synthesized results are inconsistent.

A Physical Rehabilitation Approach for Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Literature Review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological ailments. With diverse motor affectations (postural instability, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity), people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) have a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms. These include autonomic function changes, cognitive deterioration, neuropsychiatric difficulties, and sleep interruptions. Psychological disturbances, such as anxiety and sadness, are common among PwP. This discomfort is often accompanied by a decrease in general functioning, both at work and in social contacts. Furthermore, people who are experiencing psychological distress have a quick decrease in both physical and cognitive capacities. Furthermore, Pwp who also suffer from anxiety and depression are more likely to acquire dementia. It is worth noting that studies have shown good outcomes in the treatment of physical disabilities in PWP and the various therapeutics available for each affected body part, such as in the legs when they have walking problems, resting tremor in their hands, or micrography, which is a common symptom in these patients. The medical research databases PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were used to look for relevant materials. Upon meticulous scrutiny, a thorough investigation was conducted on the papers at hand. A total of 10 publications were meticulously selected based on stringent qualifying criteria. The present investigation examines various perspectives regarding the physical rehabilitation of individuals diagnosed with PD. The majority of therapeutic interventions employed revolve around cutting-edge technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), combined with exercise regimens. These interventions have demonstrated notable statistical significance in terms of enhancing various physical aspects, including endurance, performance, gait capacity, perception, and overall independence in daily life activities. One of the gathered studies makes use of the therapeutic benefits of yoga to help PwP deal with their anxiety and improve their mental health. Based on the aforementioned information, further investigation is required to ascertain the optimal approach for physical rehabilitation management and develop diverse strategies aimed at assisting individuals with PD in attaining physical autonomy.",2023,ataxic gait; exercise training; parkinson's disease; physiotherapy education; resting tremor,,"Tobar, A; Jaramillo, AP; Costa, SC; Costa, KT; Garcia, SS"

European Projects for Patients with Dementia and Their Caregivers.,"As we all know there is no treatment that can stop or delay the progression of dementia. The treatment we use is only symptomatic. EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) recommendations for dementia prevention by Sorbi et al. (2012) concluded that there is no treatment, no lifestyle, which could have an effect on prevention or delay of onset of different forms of dementia until today. The future studies in prevention must recruit younger people, larger sample, and for longer period. The last 10 years we have run, in collaboration with organizations in different European countries, many projects in order to support patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly patients with dementia and their caregivers. The first project was a 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe: predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS (Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe) study, an FP5 project with 1380 patients. Five studies were published. The second project was DESCRIPA study, an FP5 project to DEvelopment of Screening guidelines and clinical CRIteria for Predementia Alzheimer's disease, with 881 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). LLM (Long Lasting Memories) and VRADA (A virtual reality application for the exercise of dementia and Alzheimer patients) are two projects that include body and cognitive exercise for health for the elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment. The next is the RECAGE (REspectful Caring for the AGitated Elderly) project (Horizon 2020), a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. With six European universities we finished a very interesting FP6 project, the AddNeuroMed one, which gives even now information about the progression of normal elderly MCI and AD patients, in collaboration with other consortia. A very interesting Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project about digital biomarkers was entitled Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR project). The main goal of this project was the development and validation of technology-enabled, quantitative and sensitive measures of functional decline in people with early-stage AD. A running project is an Erasmus+ one in the higher education field, ""Genetic counseling in European universities: The case of neurodegenerative diseases"" (GECONEU project).

There is no consensus on how best to assess spatial orientation and traditional tests lack ecological validity, but, recently, virtual reality (VR) has provided new opportunities for this assessment.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Virtual Reality; Alzheimer Disease,"Silva, JMD; Santos, MDD; Costa, RQMD; Moretto, EG; Viveiro, LAP; Lopes, RD; Brucki, SMD; Pompeu, JE"
Usability of an Embodied CAVE System for Spatial Navigation Training in Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) usually report navigation and spatial memory impairments. Spatial navigation is an embodied process that requires the active involvement of both physical (e.g., motor commands and proprioception) and cognitive (e.g., decision-making and mental rotation) information. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a valuable tool that employs this information as real-world navigation does. Given the crucial impact of spatial navigation on daily life, research should focus on ways to enhance it. Though they are still in their development, contemporary IVR methods for spatial navigation training in MCI seem promising. In this usability study, eight patients with MCI syndrome tested an IVR spatial navigation training demo and interacted with the CAVE using active stereo glasses, a foot-motion pad, and a joypad. During the demo, users were asked to report their impressions on the IVR training using the thinking-aloud procedure. Moreover, questionnaires regarding usability, presence and cybersickness were administered at the end of the experience. Our results show that the first version of this system is usable by the patients even if most of them did not have experience with PC/IVR. The system provided a moderate sense of spatial presence and limited negative effects. Issues found during the thinking-aloud procedure concerned the visual aspects, which affected the interaction user-system. Participants reported that they needed more practice with the foot-motion pad even though the overall experience was positively evaluated. Identifying these critical features was essential to develop an improved version of the current system.",2023,aging; dementia; embodiment; spatial memory; virtual reality,,"Tuena, C; Serino, S; Stramba-Badiale, C; Pedroli, E; Goulene, KM; Stramba-Badiale, M; Riva, G"
Wayfinding and path integration deficits detected using a virtual reality mobile app in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"The ability to navigate is supported by a wide network of brain areas which are particularly vulnerable to disruption brain injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). Wayfinding and the ability to orient back to the direction you have recently come (path integration) may likely be impacted in daily life but have so far not been tested with patients with TBI. Here, we assessed spatial navigation in thirty-eight participants, fifteen of whom had a history of TBI, and twenty-three control participants. Self-estimated spatial navigation ability was assessed using the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction (SBSOD) scale. No significant difference between TBI patients and a control group was identified. Rather, results indicated that both participant groups demonstrated 'good' self-inferred spatial navigational ability on the SBSOD scale. Objective navigation ability was tested via the virtual mobile app test Sea Hero Quest (SHQ), which has been shown to predict real-world navigation difficulties and assesses (a) wayfinding across several environments and (b) path integration. Compared to a sub-sample of 13 control participants, a matched subsample of 10 TBI patients demonstrated generally poorer performance on all wayfinding environments tested. Further analysis revealed that TBI participants consistently spent a shorter duration viewing a map prior to navigating to goals. Patients showed mixed performance on the path integration task, with poor performance evident when proximal cues were absent. Our results provide preliminary evidence that TBI impacts both wayfinding and, to some extent, path integration. The findings suggest long-lasting clinical difficulties experienced in TBI patients affect both wayfinding and to some degree path integration ability.",2023,,"Humans; Mobile Applications; Brain; Spatial Navigation; Virtual Reality; Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Seton, C; Coutrot, A; Hornberger, M; Spiers, HJ; Knight, R; Whyatt, C"

[Visualization of the functional neural circuit breakdown process in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and application to the development of new therapies].,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients cause cognitive impairment in time and space as early symptoms, in which the hippocampus plays an essential role. In the hippocampus, place cells play an important role in processing spatial information. The hippocampus recognizes space and guides creatures to their destinations using these place cells. In AD patients, the hippocampal neuronal network that place cells form could malfunction with age. However, it has remained unknown how the disruption of the neural circuits progresses at a single-cell resolution in AD. Conventional methods such as electrophysiology experiments could only record the same cells in the hippocampal neural circuit of awake mice for a few days. To clear the detail of neuronal circuit disruption in AD, it is necessary to observe brains of the same individuals over several months. Therefore, we performed chronic two-photon calcium imaging using AD model mice expressing the fluorescent calcium sensor protein G-CaMP7 to monitor spatiotemporal representation in a virtual reality environment. The activity of hundreds of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was detected over months from the same neuronal populations. In AD mice, amyloid (Aβ) plaque-like aggregates in the stratum oriens layer of hippocampal CA1 start to develop at 2.5 months of age, increase in both number and size with age, and neurons with hyperactivity increase near Aβ plaque-like aggregates. In addition, place cells observed during VR navigation showed abnormalities in the stability of activity within the place field at 4 months old, and then the stability was further deteriorated and the number of place cells decreased at 7 months old. Thus, we demonstrated that the activity patterns of various neurons, including place cells, in the neural circuitry of the hippocampal CA1 region in AD have different failure modes, and this finding is expected to be applied to the effective drug evaluation for AD.",2023,,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Calcium; Neurons; Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus","Mizuta, K"
Functional Living Skills in Patients with Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Degenerative or Non-Degenerative Conditions: Effectiveness of a Non-Immersive Virtual Reality Training.,"Virtual reality has gained attention as an effective tool for cognitive, motor, and daily activity rehabilitation in patients with major neurocognitive disorder (M-NCD). The first objective of this study was to check for differences between M-NCD caused by degenerative and non-degenerative conditions (DC and NDC, respectively) in terms of relearning four functional living skills (FLSs), by means of a non-immersive virtual reality training (VRT). The second purpose was to verify whether spontaneous transfer from the virtual environment to the real environment occurred. Four FLS apps were developed in our institute (Information, Suitcase, Medicine, and Supermarket). A nonrandomized interventional study was carried out, comparing experimental and control groups (EG and CG, respectively). The study included three phases: in vivo test at T1; VRT at T2 only for EG; in vivo test at T3. During the in vivo test, the four FLSs were assessed in their natural environments. Both EG-DC and EG-NDC significantly improved in all of the VRT variable scores (the EG-NDC group seemed to show better outcomes than the EG-DC group). Moderate-to-high satisfaction with the VRT was reported. EG-DC and EG-NDC also enhanced their performances in the in vivo test. No statistically significant differences between them were found. CG-DC and CG-NDC improved only in the execution time of Information in the in vivo test. These findings confirm the ecological validity of VRT for FLSs.",2023,degenerative dementia; functional living skills; neurocognitive disorders; non-degenerative dementia; virtual reality,Humans; Dementia; Patients; Activities of Daily Living; Biological Assay; Virtual Reality,"Panerai, S; Catania, V; Rundo, F; Tasca, D; Musso, S; Babiloni, C; Prestianni, G; Muratore, S; Ferri, R"

Affective Out-World Experience via Virtual Reality for Older Adults Living with Mild Cognitive Impairments or Mild Dementia.,"Older adults with cognitive impairments may face barriers to accessing experiences beyond their physical premises. Previous research has suggested that missing out on emotional experiences may affect mental health and impact cognitive abilities. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions to improve the health-related quality of life of older adults. With virtual reality offering endless opportunities for health support, we must consider how virtual reality can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences to older adults to enhance their emotional regulation. Thirty older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia participated in the study. Affect and emotional behavior were measured. The usability and the sense of presence were also assessed. Finally, we assessed the virtual reality experiences based on physiological responses and eye-tracking data. The results indicated that virtual reality can positively enhance the mental health of this population by eliciting a positive affective state and enhancing their emotional regulation. Overall, this paper raises awareness of the role of virtual reality in emotion elicitation, regulation, and expression and enhances our understanding of the use of virtual reality by older adults living with mild cognitive impairments or mild dementia.",2023,affective computing; dementia; emotional experiences; human-centered technologies; mild cognitive impairment; older adults; user experience; virtual reality,Humans; Aged; Quality of Life; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Cognition; Virtual Reality,"Matsangidou, M; Solomou, T; Frangoudes, F; Ioannou, K; Theofanous, P; Papayianni, E; Pattichis, CS"

Path integration selectively predicts midlife risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the first cortical region to exhibit neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with EC grid cell dysfunction. Given the role of grid cells in path integration, we predicted that path integration impairment would represent the first behavioural change in adults at-risk of AD. Using immersive virtual reality, we found that midlife path integration impairments predicted both hereditary and physiological AD risk, with no corresponding impairment on tests of episodic memory or other spatial behaviours. Impairments related to poorer angular estimation and were associated with hexadirectional grid-like fMRI signal in the posterior-medial EC. These results indicate that altered path integration may represent the transition point from at-risk state to disease onset in AD, prior to impairment in other cognitive domains.",2023,,,"Newton, C; Pope, M; Rua, C; Henson, R; Ji, Z; Burgess, N; Rodgers, CT; Stangl, M; Dounavi, ME; Castegnaro, A; Koychev, I; Malhotra, P; Wolbers, T; Ritchie, K; Ritchie, CW; O'Brien, J; Su, L; Chan, D"
An Intervention on Anxiety Symptoms in Moderate Alzheimer's Disease through Virtual Reality: A Feasibility Study and Lessons Learned.,"(1) Background: Although cognitive impairment is considered the core deficit of dementia, anxiety disorders also have a negative influence on the social and daily life of the affected population.

(2) Methods: Three participants were recruited from a day center to participate in a five-week study, which included a Pre- and Post-evaluation with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the anxiety subdomain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Participants' heart rate, oxygen saturation, arterial pressure, and respiratory rate were also monitored during intervention sessions. Three virtual scenarios from Nature Treks VR were used as the intervention over three weeks (a total of nine sessions). (3) Results: Post-intervention anxiety assessment showed a light reduction in psychological anxiety in the HARS questionnaire. A light reduction in heart rate was also observed during the exposure to iVR. (4) Discussion: The use of virtual scenarios was a satisfactory experience for all the participants.

Digital Intervention For The Management Of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial, chronic, neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence and limited therapeutic options, making it a global health crisis. Being the most common cause of dementia, AD erodes the cognitive, functional, and social abilities of the individual and causes escalating medical and psychosocial needs. As yet, this disorder has no cure and current treatment options are palliative in nature. There is an urgent need for novel therapy to address this pressing challenge. Digital therapeutics (Dtx) is one such novel therapy that is gaining popularity globally. Dtx provides evidence based therapeutic interventions driven by internet and software, employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames, apps, sensors, virtual reality aiding in the prevention, management, and treatment of ailments like neurological abnormalities and chronic diseases. Dtx acts as a supportive tool for the optimization of patient care, individualized treatment and improved health outcomes. Dtx uses visual, sound and other non-invasive approaches for instance-consistent therapy, reminiscence therapy, computerised cognitive training, semantic and phonological assistance devices, wearables and computer-assisted rehabilitation environment to find applications in Alzheimer's disease for improving memory, cognition, functional abilities and managing motor symptom. A few of the Dtx-based tools employed in AD include ""Memory Matters"", ""AlzSense"", ""Alzheimer Assistant"", ""smart robotic dog"", ""Immersive virtual reality (iVR)"" and the most current gamma stimulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current trends in digital health in AD and explore the benefits, challenges, and impediments of using Dtx as an adjunctive therapy for the management of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Dementia; Digital health.; Internet of things; Mobile apps; Reminiscence therapy,,"Manchanda, N; Aggarwal, A; Setya, S; Talegaonkar, S"

Bridging gaps in the design and implementation of socially assistive technologies for dementia care: the role of occupational therapy.,"Dementia is a global health challenge, and people living with dementia (PLWD) are especially susceptible to reduced engagement in meaningful occupations, including social participation. In the past few decades, socially assistive technologies continue to be developed amidst a rapidly evolving technological landscape to support the social health of PLWD and their caregivers. Examples include social robots, virtual reality, smart home technology, and various digital technologies, such as mobile applications for tablets and smartphones. Despite an increasing body of research and interest in this field, several gaps relating to the design and implementation process of socially assistive technologies continue to undermine their relevance for PLWD in daily life. In this paper, some of these gaps are highlighted and the role of occupational therapy in the design and implementation of socially assistive technology is presented. In the design process, occupational therapists are uniquely skilled to advise and advocate for the tailoring and personalisation of technology to address the occupational needs of PLWD. In the implementation of socially assistive technologies, occupational therapists are skilled to educate, train, and conduct ongoing evaluations with PLWD and their caregivers, to incorporate socially assistive technologies into their routine and daily lives. We recommend that occupational therapists should continue to be acquainted with such technologies through continuous professional development and educational curricula. Moreover, we highlight the necessary collaboration between occupational therapists, technology developers, and researchers to enhance the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology, so that their relevance for PLWD and their caregivers can be maximised.Implications for rehabilitationDevelopers and designers of socially assistive technology should consider the disease trajectory of different types of dementia, as well as the different needs, abilities, preferences, occupations and routines of people living with dementia (PLWD) and/or their caregivers.Collaborations between technology developers, researchers, and occupational therapists should take place iteratively throughout the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology to maximise their relevance and applicability for people living with dementia and their caregivers.To continue enhancing the current role of occupational therapy in socially assistive technology provision, occupational therapists should keep up to date with socially assistive technology that are being developed to support the social health of PLWD.",2024,Occupational therapy; dementia; design; digital technology; emerging technologies; implementation; smart home technology; social robots; socially assistive technology; virtual reality,Humans; Dementia; Occupational Therapy; Caregivers; Occupational Therapists; Self-Help Devices,"Koh, WQ; Heins, P; Flynn, A; Mahmoudi Asl, A; Garcia, L; Malinowsky, C; Brorsson, A"

Using paired survey questions, students reported significant increases in understanding how their lives would be affected by dementia (71% vs. 94%) and the needs of a person with dementia (64% vs. 95%) after VR. They reported increased understanding of being a caregiver of someone with dementia (24% vs. 81%) and the impact it can have on the entire family (64% vs. 97%). Overall students agreed this simulation made them think about their approach to clinical skills (94%) and should be utilized more in the curriculum (76%). This pilot study indicated that this VR experience can be used to advance understanding of a person's experiences with dementia and that integrating VR into the medical curricula should be considered.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; embodiment; empathy; simulation; virtual reality,"Humans; Students, Medical; Pilot Projects; Geriatrics; Alzheimer Disease; Virtual Reality","Bard, JT; Chung, HK; Shaia, JK; Wellman, LL; Elzie, CA"
Preparing future health care workers for interactions with people with dementia: A mixed methods study.,"Strategies used in training future health professionals have expanded from traditional methods to a variety of approaches, including sensitivity training. Students who receive disease-specific sensitivity training are more compassionate to patients. Alzheimer's disease (AD) sensitivity training includes deficit-focused dementia tours that physically alter sensations. This embedded-experimental (between-subjects) variant mixed-methods study assessed the effectiveness of virtual reality as a delivery format for dementia tours compared to dementia tours that physically alter sensations. It also compared the effectiveness of deficit-focused dementia sensitivity training to reading strengths-focused case studies, a traditional instruction method. Forty-one university students were randomized into one of three conditions. All participants completed pre- and post-assessments and were interviewed. Quantitative results indicate that a dementia tour offered through virtual reality is as effective as a physical-based tour; however, compared to reading case studies, participants reported poorer attitudes about living with AD and feeling less prepared for caregiving. The qualitative results show an increase in empathy across all conditions. Integration of findings indicates that dementia tours in both formats are effective at encouraging empathy and that both strengths-based and deficit-based sensitivity training are important components of education for future health care workers.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; empathy; health care; virtual reality,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Dementia; Empathy; Geriatrics; Health Personnel,"Torrence, C; Bhanu, A; Bertrand, J; Dye, C; Truong, K; Madathil, KC"
Using Virtual Reality to Improve the Quality of Life of Older Adults with Cognitive Impairments and their Family Members who Live at a Distance.,"This study examines whether using virtual reality (VR) with older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild to moderate dementia with a family member who lives at a distance can improve the quality of life of the older adult and the family member. Twenty-one older adults in a senior living community and a family member (who participated in the VR with the older adult from a distance) engaged in a baseline telephone call, followed by three weekly VR sessions. The VR was associated with improvements in older adults' affect and stress, relationship with their family member, and overall quality of life, compared to baseline. Family members' negative affect, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden also decreased and their mental health improved after using the VR, compared to baseline. Using the VR, however, did not change their relationship with the older adult. In addition, older adults and family members who experienced the VR sessions as more socially engaging reported better psychological and relational well-being, with older adults also experiencing greater improvements in overall quality of life. Finally, preliminary results suggest that older adults with dementia and their family members might benefit even more from using the VR than older adults with MCI and their family members.",2023,MCI; Rendever; dementia; family members; long-distance; older adults; relationship maintenance; senior living communities; the Theory of Resilience and Relational Load; virtual reality,Humans; Aged; Quality of Life; Cognitive Dysfunction; Virtual Reality; Family; Dementia,"Afifi, T; Collins, N; Rand, K; Otmar, C; Mazur, A; Dunbar, NE; Fujiwara, K; Harrison, K; Logsdon, R"
A Systematic Review of Navigation Assistance Systems for People With Dementia.,"Technological developments provide solutions to alleviate the tremendous impact on the health and autonomy due to the impact of dementia on navigation abilities. We systematically reviewed the literature on devices tested to provide assistance to people with dementia during indoor, outdoor and virtual navigation (PROSPERO ID number: 215585). Medline and Scopus databases were searched from inception. Our aim was to summarize the results from the literature to guide future developments. Twenty-three articles were included in our study. Three types of information were extracted from these studies. First, the types of navigation advice the devices provided were assessed through: (i) the sensorial modality of presentation, e.g., visual and tactile stimuli, (ii) the navigation content, e.g., landmarks, and (iii) the timing of presentation, e.g., systematically at intersections. Second, we analyzed the technology that the devices were based on, e.g., smartphone. Third, the experimental methodology used to assess the devices and the navigation outcome was evaluated. We report and discuss the results from the literature based on these three main characteristics. Finally, based on these considerations, recommendations are drawn, challenges are identified and potential solutions are suggested. Augmented reality-based devices, intelligent tutoring systems and social support should particularly further be explored.",2023,,"Humans; Computer Graphics; Augmented Reality; Databases, Factual; Smartphone; Dementia","Pillette, L; Moreau, G; Normand, JM; Perrier, M; Lecuyer, A; Cogne, M"
Using second life to teach health professions students about Alzheimer's Disease: A comprehensive review.,"Increased training is necessary to ensure that the next generation of health care professionals are prepared to effectively and compassionately serve patients with Alzheimer's Disease. Second Life® is a virtual world shown to provide a safe, convenient, and effective environment for teaching health-related content. To date, there has been no comprehensive review of studies using Second Life in education about Alzheimer's Disease. The authors conducted a scoping review of the literature on the use of Second Life in the education of medical, nursing, and health professions students about Alzheimer's Disease. Searches were conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL. Thirty-two studies containing outcomes of the application of virtual reality and the virtual world Second Life were identified. Studies were classified using the Kirkpatrick Four-Level Training Evaluation Model. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and confidence (Level 2), were most commonly reported, followed by positive reactions (Level 1). No studies identified system-level results and few examined changes in behavior. While results indicate positive student reactions and enhanced learning from Second Life interventions related to Alzheimer's Disease, they also highlight a need for future research examining outcomes at the higher Kirkpatrick levels.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Health professions education; second life,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Clinical Competence; Geriatrics; Students, Health Occupations; Health Personnel","Barros Una, L; Brangman, S; Indelicato, A; Krueger, A; Ludwig, A; Slutzky, AR; Stewart, T; Germain, LJ"
