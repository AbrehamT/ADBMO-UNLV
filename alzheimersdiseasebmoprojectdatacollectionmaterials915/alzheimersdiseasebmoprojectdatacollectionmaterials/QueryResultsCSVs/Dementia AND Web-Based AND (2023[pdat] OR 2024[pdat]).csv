"Dysregulation of Lipid Metabolism Serves as A Link Between Alzheimer's and Cardiovascular Disease, As Witnessed in A Cross-Sectional Study.","Cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) increase the risk of suffering dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Here, we set out to define specific molecular profiles of CVD in patients with DAT to better understand its relationship, to unravel the mechanisms underlying the high risk of developing DAT in CVD patients and to define new markers of early disease. Plasma samples from patients with DAT, with and without CVD, were analyzed through a multiomics approach, with integration of metabolomics and proteomics datasets using the OmicsNet web-based tool. Metabolomics results showed an enrichment in lipids and lipid-like molecules. Similarly, the most significant cluster identified through proteomics was formed by 5 proteins related to lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism. After integration and functional enrichment, glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation and sphingolipid metabolism were among the most significant functions. Finally, differential expression of ABCA1 and APOH proteins was verified, in an independent cohort also including controls and patients with CVD alone. Both proteins positively correlated with phospho-Tau (181), a classical hallmark of DAT. Different molecular profiles exist in patients with DAT, with and without CVD, with exacerbated alterations in patients in which DAT and CVD co-exist. This information may help to define biomarkers like ABCA1 and APOH that identify patients with cardiovascular dysfunction that are at high risk of developing DAT. Such markers will allow more personalized interventions to be selected, a further step towards precision medicine for individuals whose molecular profiles indicate a distinct response to the same management strategies.",2024,,,"Mourino-Alvarez, L; Juarez-Alia, C; Sastre-Oliva, T; Perales-Sánchez, I; Hernandez-Fernandez, G; Chicano-Galvez, E; Peralbo-Molina, Á; Madruga, F; Blanco-Lopez, E; Tejerina, T; Barderas, MG"

Evaluation of interactive web-based tools to stimulate reflection and communication about advance care planning with people with dementia and their family caregivers.,"People with dementia and their family caregivers often encounter challenges in engaging in advance care planning (ACP), such as a lack of information and difficulties in engaging in ACP conversations. Using a user-centred design, we developed two interactive web-based tools as part of an ACP support website to stimulate ACP reflection and communication: (1) the 'Thinking Now About Later' tool, with open-ended questions about 'what matters most', and (2) a digital version of the 'Life Wishes Cards', a card tool with pre-formulated statements that prompt reflection about wishes for future care. This study aimed to evaluate the use of and experiences with two web-based tools by people with dementia and their family caregivers.",2024,Advance care planning; Communication; Dementia; Reflection; Web-based tools,"Humans; Advance Care Planning; Dementia; Caregivers; Male; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Internet; Aged, 80 and over; Communication; Qualitative Research; Adult","Monnet, F; Pivodic, L; Dupont, C; Smets, T; De Vleminck, A; Van Audenhove, C; Van den Block, L"
Evaluating a mobile-based intervention to promote the mental health of informal dementia caregivers in Singapore: Study protocol for a pilot two-armed randomised controlled trial.,"Informal caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) often suffer adverse impacts on their mental health and require interventions for effective support. As they are often occupied with providing care, web-based interventions could be more convenient and efficient for them. However, there is currently a dearth of evidence-based mobile interventions to enhance the mental well-being of dementia caregivers locally, especially ones that are user-centered and culturally relevant. Hence, having designed an app based on feedback from local dementia caregivers, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of this mobile app in promoting the mental health of informal caregivers of PWD in Singapore.",2024,,Humans; Caregivers; Dementia; Singapore; Mental Health; Pilot Projects; Mobile Applications; Female; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Middle Aged,"Lee, YT; Yuan, Q; Zhang, Y; Samari, E; Goveas, R; Ng, LL; Subramaniam, M"

Evaluation of the Parkinson's Remote Interactive Monitoring System in a Clinical Setting: Usability Study.,"The fastest-growing neurological disorder is Parkinson disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 10 million people worldwide. PD is typically treated with levodopa, an oral pill taken to increase dopamine levels, and other dopaminergic agonists. As the disease advances, the efficacy of the drug diminishes, necessitating adjustments in treatment dosage according to the patient's symptoms and disease progression. Therefore, remote monitoring systems that can provide more detailed and accurate information on a patient's condition regularly are a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to manage their medication. The Parkinson's Remote Interactive Monitoring System (PRIMS), developed by PragmaClin Research Inc, was designed on the premise that it will be an easy-to-use digital system that can accurately capture motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD remotely.",2024,Parkinson disease; System Usability Scale; mobile phone; motor examination; movement disorders; remote monitoring; thematic analysis; usability,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; User-Computer Interface; Monitoring, Physiologic","Bridges, B; Taylor, J; Weber, JT"

Adapting a Dutch Web-Based Intervention to Support Family Caregivers of People With Dementia in the UK Context: Accelerated Experience-Based Co-Design.,"Around 700,000 family caregivers provide unpaid care for 900,000 people living with dementia in the United Kingdom. Few family caregivers receive support for their own psychological needs and funding for community respite services has declined. These trends are seen across Europe as demographic and budgetary pressures have intensified due to public spending cuts arising from the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization has prioritized the need to expand the provision of support for caregivers and families of people with dementia by 2025. Web-based interventions have the potential for development as they require modest investment and can be accessed by family caregivers at home. Further cost benefits can be realized by adapting existing interventions with demonstrated effectiveness for new contexts.

The cost of these responsibilities is often borne by informal caregivers, who experience an elevated risk of negative physical and psychological outcomes. Previously, we designed a positive emotion regulation intervention that was shown to improve well-being among dementia caregivers when delivered through one-on-one videoconferencing lessons with a trained facilitator. However, the format required significant resources in terms of logistics and facilitator time.

Communicating visit information to family caregivers: How does method matter? A national survey.,"The clinic visit is a critical point of contact for family caregivers. However, only 37% of family caregivers are able to accompany patients to visits. When they cannot attend, caregivers receive visit information to assist with their caregiving. However, little is known about how method of receiving information from clinic visits is associated with important caregiver outcomes.

Implementing the network-based tool, a dense module search of genome-wide association studies (dmGWAS), we integrated a large-scale GWAS dataset with DNA methylation data to identify gene network modules associated with AD. Our analysis yielded 286 significant gene network modules. Notably, the foremost module included the BIN1 gene, showing the largest GWAS signal, and the GNAS gene, the most significantly hypermethylated. We conducted Web-based Cell-type-Specific Enrichment Analysis (WebCSEA) on genes within the top 10% of dmGWAS modules, highlighting monocyte as the most significant cell type (",2024,DNA methylation; epigenetics; genome-wide association studies (GWAS); network analysis; protein–protein interaction,,"Sanders, KL; Manuel, AM; Liu, A; Leng, B; Chen, X; Zhao, Z"

Randomized controlled trial of a positive emotion regulation intervention to reduce stress in family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease: protocol and design for the LEAF 2.0 study.,"Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease can be stressful, resulting in poorer emotional and physical health among family caregivers. Although supportive resources for caregivers are available, distance, caregiver health, and the daily demands of caregiving are barriers to access. Based on research demonstrating the importance of positive emotions in coping with stress, our previous trial showed that dementia caregivers who participated in facilitated, web-based delivery of a positive emotion regulation intervention called LEAF (Life Enhancing Activities for Family caregivers) experienced increased positive emotion and decreased depression and anxiety.

Validation of a web-based self-administered test for cognitive assessment in a Swedish geriatric setting.,"Computerized cognitive tests have the potential to cost-effectively detect and monitor cognitive impairments and thereby facilitate treatment for these conditions. However, relatively few of these tests have been validated in a variety of populations. Brain on Track, a self-administered web-based test, has previously been shown to have a good ability to differentiate between healthy individuals and patients with cognitive impairment in Portuguese populations. The objective of this study was to validate the differential ability and evaluate the usability of Brain on Track in a Swedish memory clinic setting. Brain on Track was administered to 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia and 30 healthy controls, all scheduled to perform the test from home after one week and after three months. To evaluate the usability, the patient group was interviewed after completion of the testing phase. Patients scored lower than healthy controls at both the first (median score 42.4 vs 54.1, p<0.001) and the second test (median score 42.3 vs 55.0, p<0.001). The test-retest intra-class correlation was 0.87. A multiple logistic regression model accounting for effects of age, gender and education rendered an ability of Brain on Track to differentiate between the groups with an area under the receiver operation characteristics curve of 0.90 for the first and 0.88 for the second test. In the subjective evaluation, nine patients left positive comments, nine were negative whereas five left mixed comments regarding the test experience. Sixty percent of patients had received help from relatives to log on to the platform. In conclusion, Brain on Track performed well in differentiating healthy controls from patients with cognitive impairment and showed a high test-retest reliability, on par with results from previous studies. However, the substantial proportion of patients needing help to log in could to some extent limit an independent use of the platform.",2024,,Humans; Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Sweden; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognition; Internet,"Rystedt, E; Morén, J; Lindbäck, J; Tedim Cruz, V; Ingelsson, M; Kilander, L; Lunet, N; Pais, J; Ruano, L; Westman, G"

Digital Therapeutics for Improving Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Drugs and Biological Products: Preclinical and Clinical Studies Supporting Development of Drug + Digital Combination Therapies for Chronic Diseases.,"Limitations of pharmaceutical drugs and biologics for chronic diseases (e.g., medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, or inadequate efficacy) can be mitigated by mobile medical apps, known as digital therapeutics (DTx). Authorization of adjunct DTx by the US Food and Drug Administration and draft guidelines on ""prescription drug use-related software"" illustrate opportunities to create drug + digital combination therapies, ultimately leading towards drug-device combination products (DTx has a status of medical devices). Digital interventions (mobile, web-based, virtual reality, and video game applications) demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for people living with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. In the respective animal disease models, preclinical studies on environmental enrichment and other non-pharmacological modalities (physical activity, social interactions, learning, and music) as surrogates for DTx ""active ingredients"" also show improved outcomes.

Ambulance use and emergency department visits among people with dementia: A cross-sectional survey.,"This study aimed to explore factors associated with ambulance use and emergency department (ED) visits among people with dementia in the month before death. A web-based survey of bereaved family caregivers of people with dementia was conducted in March 2020. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted with ambulance use and ED visits in the month before death as dependent variables. Age and gender of people with dementia and their family caregivers, home care use, decision-makers, comorbidities, degree of independence in daily living, and caregivers' preparedness for death were independent variables. Data were collected from 817 caregivers of people with dementia who had died at hospitals (52.4%), long-term care facilities (25.0%), or own homes (22.4%). Caregivers' lack of preparedness for death was significantly associated with ambulance use in the month before death. Comorbidites and males with dementia were significantly associated with ED visits in the month before death. Better death preparedness of family caregivers may reduce ambulance use for symptoms that can be more effectively addressed by palliative care than acute care for people with dementia.",2023,ambulance; cross-sectional study; dementia; emergency department; logistic regression,"Male; Humans; Ambulances; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia; Caregivers; Emergency Service, Hospital","Nasu, K; Miyashita, M; Hirooka, K; Endo, T; Fukahori, H"

Promoting Advance Care Planning for Persons with Dementia: Study Protocol for the LEAD (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer's and Other Dementias) Clinical Trial.,"Due to the insidious progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), surrogate decision-makers typically make medical and long-term-care decisions for a care recipient, most often a family care partner. Unfortunately, many care recipient/care partner dyads have failed to engage in advance care planning or have lost the opportunity to do so due to the cognitive decline of the care recipient. To address this need, our team created a validated dementia-focused advance care planning tool known as the LEAD Guide (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer's and Other Dementias). With funding from the National Alzheimer's Association and in consultation with our community advisory board, we developed a preliminary web-based intervention. This intervention integrates the LEAD Guide with self-paced educational modules that lead dyads through conversations and dementia-focused advance care planning processes. In this concept paper, we describe the aims of our funded R01 clinical trial (National Institute on Aging), where we aim to refine our preliminary web-based platform for use in a 5-month mixed-method NIH Stage-1 behavioral intervention. Using a sample of diverse community-based ADRD dyads (n = 60), we aim to: 1) describe the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of the intervention, 2) assess the initial efficacy of the intervention on the primary outcome (decision-making self-efficacy), and secondary outcomes (relationship quality, subjective well-being, anxiety) as perceived by both the care recipient and the care partner, and 3) examine advance care planning congruence as a mechanism of action. The LEAD clinical trial addresses public health challenges by guiding and supporting families through challenging advance care planning conversations, facilitating the transfer of knowledge regarding care preferences and values from the care recipient to the care partner, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for both individuals with ADRD and their care partners.",2023,Decision-making; care partner; goals of care; persons with dementia,,"Dassel, KB; Iacob, E; Utz, RL; Supiano, KP; Fuhrmann, H"

Development and preliminary usability testing of an electronic conversation guide incorporating patient values and prognostic information in preparation for older people's decision-making near the end of life.,"Initiating end-of-life conversations can be daunting for clinicians and overwhelming for patients and families. This leads to delays in communicating prognosis and preparing for the inevitable in old age, often generating potentially harmful overtreatment and poor-quality deaths. We aimed to develop an electronic resource, called Communicating Health Alternatives Tool (CHAT) that was compatible with hospital medical records software to facilitate preparation for shared decision-making across health settings with older adults deemed to be in the last year of life. The project used mixed methods including: literature review, user-directed specifications, web-based interface development with authentication and authorization; clinician and consumer co-design, iterative consultation for user testing; and ongoing developer integration of user feedback. An internet-based conversation guide to facilitate clinician-led advance care planning was co-developed covering screening for short-term risk of death, patient values and preferences, and treatment choices for chronic kidney disease and dementia. Printed summary of such discussion could be used to begin the process in hospital or community health services. Clinicians, patients, and caregivers agreed with its ease of use and were generally accepting of its contents and format.

Efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies in current Alzheimer's disease phase III clinical trials: A systematic review and interactive web app-based meta-analysis.,"The risk-benefit profile of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear, especially concerning their safety and overall effects on AD progression and cognitive function. Here, we investigated cognitive, biomarker and side effects of anti-Aβ mAbs in large phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in sporadic AD. The search was performed on Google Scholar, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov by applying Jadad score to evaluate the methodological quality of the reports. Studies were excluded if they scored < 3 on Jadad scale or if they analyzed less than 200 sporadic AD patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model in R. Primary outcomes were cognitive: AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary and tertiary outcomes included biomarkers of Aβ and tau pathology, adverse events, and performance on Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Scale. The meta-analysis included 14,980 patients in 14 studies and four mAbs: Bapineuzumab, Aducanumab, Solanezumab and Lecanemab. The results of this study suggest that anti-Aβ mAbs statistically improved cognitive and biomarker outcomes, particularly Aducanumab and Lecanemab. However, while cognitive effects were of small effect sizes, these drugs considerably increased risk of side effects such as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), especially in APOE-ε4 carriers. Meta-regression revealed that higher (better) baseline MMSE score was associated with improved ADAS Cog and CDR-SB.

The influence of web-based decision aids on informal caregivers of people with dementia: A systematic mixed-methods review.,"Caring for people with dementia is considered one of the most stressful and difficult forms of care. Informal caregivers constantly face high physical and emotional burdens. Therefore, it is essential to provide them with effective and practical support. Web-based decision aids can provide convenient and effective decision support for informal caregivers. The aim of this study was to assess and synthesize the influence of web-based decision aids on informal caregivers of people with dementia. Searches of electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, PsycINFO, CNKI, Open Grey and Baidu Wenku) and reference lists of relevant studies were conducted in July 2022. Qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies published in Chinese and English on the use of web-based decision aids by informal caregivers of people with dementia were included. The studies were selected by screening titles, abstracts and full texts, and the quality of each study was assessed by two researchers independently. Fourteen studies were published between 2010 and 2022, including five qualitative studies, four quantitative studies and five mixed-methods studies. Web-based decision aids have a positive influence on informal caregivers of people with dementia by providing decision support, satisfying needs, promoting psychological health, improving communication ability and reducing caregiver burden. Informal caregivers of people with dementia are receptive to web-based decision aids and expect their functionality to be optimized further. Web-based decision aids offer potential benefits to informal caregivers by providing effective decision-making support and improving their psychological health and ability to communicate.",2023,caregivers; decision aids; decision making; dementia; systematic review; web,Humans; Caregivers; Mental Health; Dementia; Decision Support Techniques; Internet,"Zhi, S; Ma, D; Song, D; Gao, S; Sun, J; He, M; Zhu, X; Dong, Y; Gao, Q; Sun, J"

Public perspective on medications to delay Alzheimer's disease symptoms.,"Disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease are emerging. Our research examined how personal risk for AD may influence intentions to ask for medications to delay symptoms of AD, and how the availability of such medications impacts interest in AD-related genetic testing. Invitations to a web-based survey were posted on social media sites. Respondents were sequentially assigned to imagine that they had a 5%, 15%, or 35% chance of developing AD. They were then provided a hypothetical scenario describing a medication that delayed AD symptoms. After reporting intentions to ask for the medication, respondents were asked about their interest in genetic testing to predict AD risk. Data from 310 individuals were analyzed. Intentions to ask for a preventative medication were greater for respondents presented AD risks of 35% compared to risks of 15% and 5% (86% vs. 66% vs. 62%, respectively, p < 0.001). The proportion who would ask for genetic susceptibility testing increased from 58% to 79% when respondents were told to imagine that a medication that delayed AD symptoms existed (p < 0.001). Findings suggest that individuals who know they have an increased risk for AD are more likely pursue medications to delay onset of disease symptoms, and the availability of AD-delaying treatments will increase interest in associated genetic testing. Findings provide insight about who will pursue emerging preventative medications, including individuals for whom the medications may be inappropriate, and the impact on genetic test utilization.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; attitudes; genetic susceptibility; genetic testing; risk assessment; survey,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genetic Testing; Surveys and Questionnaires,"Rich, MB; Blout Zawatsky, CL; Botta, JJ; Christensen, KD"

Although experts are discussing the strengths and weaknesses of telepractice, a precise analysis of the differences between analogue and digital communication for this heterogeneous group of patients is still missing. The three current single cases investigated verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication in a face-to-face (F2F) and digital setting through a qualitative research design. Using the scenario-test (ST) in person and via big blue button (BBB; video conferencing system), several decisive factors were detected, influencing the effectiveness of communication in a F2F compared to a digital setting.

The Association between Dietary Iron Intake and Incidence of Dementia in Adults Aged 60 Years or over in the UK Biobank.,"Background Several studies have investigated the association between dietary iron intake and cognitive impairment, but little is known about the relationship between iron intake and dementia incidence. Objectives This study explored the association between dietary iron intake and incident dementia in males and females. Whether this association was modified by factors such as age and medical diseases was also examined. Methods We included 41,213 males and 48,892 females aged 60 years or over, from the UK-Biobank cohort. Dietary iron intake was measured using a web-based 24-h dietary recall questionnaire from between 2009 and 2012. Incident dementia was ascertained using hospital inpatient records and death registers until April 2021. Cox proportional regression models examined the association between iron intake and incident dementia, and hazard ratio curves were constructed with knots from the analysis indicating insufficient or excessive iron intake. Results During a mean follow-up of 11.8 years, 560 males and 492 females developed dementia. A non-linear relationship between iron intake and incident dementia was observed in both males and females. The lowest incidence rates were observed in the higher iron intake quintile (Q4: ≥15.73, <17.57 mg/day) for males, and the intermediate iron intake quintile (Q3: ≥12.4, <13.71 mg/day) for females. Among those aged 60 and above, all-cause dementia in males was associated with deficient iron intake (Q1 versus Q4: Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.37, 95% Confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.01−1.86, p = 0.042) and excessive iron intake (Q5 versus Q4: HR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.14−1.96, p = 0.003), whilst significant associations between all-cause dementia and deficient iron intake were only observed in females without hypertension. Smoking status was a significant moderator (p-value for trend = 0.017) for dementia in males only. Conclusions Excessive iron intake (≥17.57 mg/day) is associated with a higher incidence of all-cause dementia in males and smoking status modified this association amongst males. Deficient iron intake (<10.93 mg/day) was associated with a higher incidence of all-cause dementia in females without a history of hypertension.",2023,dementia; dietary iron; gender; modification analysis; sensitivity analysis,"Male; Female; Adult; Humans; Iron, Dietary; Incidence; Risk Factors; Iron; Biological Specimen Banks; Hypertension; United Kingdom; Dementia","Liu, J; Chen, Y; Lu, X; Xu, X; Bulloch, G; Zhu, S; Zhu, Z; Ge, Z; Wang, W; Shang, X; He, M"

Neuroimaging and verbal memory assessment in healthy aging adults using a portable low-field MRI scanner and a web-based platform: results from a proof-of-concept population-based cross-section study.,"Consumer wearables and health monitors, internet-based health and cognitive assessments, and at-home biosample (e.g., saliva and capillary blood) collection kits are increasingly used by public health researchers for large population-based studies without requiring intensive in-person visits. Alongside reduced participant time burden, remote and virtual data collection allows the participation of individuals who live long distances from hospital or university research centers, or who lack access to transportation. Unfortunately, studies that include magnetic resonance neuroimaging are challenging to perform remotely given the infrastructure requirements of MRI scanners, and, as a result, they often omit socially, economically, and educationally disadvantaged individuals. Lower field strength systems (< 100 mT) offer the potential to perform neuroimaging at a participant's home, enabling more accessible and equitable research. Here we report the first use of a low-field MRI ""scan van"" with an online assessment of paired-associate learning (PAL) to examine associations between brain morphometry and verbal memory performance. In a sample of 67 individuals, 18-93 years of age, imaged at or near their home, we show expected white and gray matter volume trends with age and find significant (p < 0.05 FWE) associations between PAL performance and hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, and thalamic volumes. High-quality data were acquired in 93% of individuals, and at-home scanning was preferred by all individuals with prior MRI at a hospital or research setting. Results demonstrate the feasibility of remote neuroimaging and cognitive data collection, with important implications for engaging traditionally under-represented communities in neuroimaging research.",2023,"Brain MRI; Dementia; Diversity in health research; Low-field MRI; Remote data collection, aging; Web-based cognitive assessment",Humans; Adult; Brain; Healthy Aging; Cognition; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging,"Deoni, SCL; Burton, P; Beauchemin, J; Cano-Lorente, R; De Both, MD; Johnson, M; Ryan, L; Huentelman, MJ"
