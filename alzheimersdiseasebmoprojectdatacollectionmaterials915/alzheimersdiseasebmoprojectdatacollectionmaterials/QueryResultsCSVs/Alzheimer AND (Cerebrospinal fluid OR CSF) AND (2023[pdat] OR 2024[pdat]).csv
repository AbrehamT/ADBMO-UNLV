Novel diagnostic and prognostic approach for rapidly progressive dementias: Indicators based on amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework.,Apply established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biomarkers and novel combined indicators based on the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework to improve diagnostic and prognostic power in patients with rapidly progressive dementias (RPDs).,2024,ATN framework; Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; autoimmune encephalitis; diagnosis; prognosis; rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease,,"Cheng, Y; Chen, SF; Zhang, YR; Guo, Y; Wu, KM; Huang, YY; Aerqin, Q; Kuo, K; Li, HQ; Chen, SD; Liu, WS; Dong, Q; Yu, JT"
Amyloid-β but not tau accumulation is strongly associated with longitudinal cognitive decline.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is featured by the extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. We studied whether Aβ and tau accumulation are independently associated with future cognitive decline in the AD continuum.,2024,Alzheimer's disease; amyloid‐β; cognition function; tau accumulation,"Humans; tau Proteins; Female; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Positron-Emission Tomography; Longitudinal Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Disease Progression; Alzheimer Disease; Middle Aged","Wang, W; Huang, J; Qian, S; Zheng, Y; Yu, X; Jiang, T; Ai, R; Hou, J; Ma, E; Cai, J; He, H; Wang, X; Xie, C"
APOE 5'UTR Methylation Pattern Analysis in Blood and Brain Tissue from Alzheimer's Disease Affected Patients.,"APOE ε4 allele is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Furthermore, APOE methylation pattern has been described to be associated with the disease and to follow a bimodal pattern, with a hypermethylated CpG island and a hypomethylated promoter region. However, little is known about the methylation levels in the APOE 5'UTR region. Here, the methylation of two regions (R1 and R2) within APOE 5'UTR was investigated in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and hippocampus (HIC) samples to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and to associate clinical, genetic features and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers levels. DNA was extracted from PBMCs of 20 AD and 20 healthy controls (HC) and from 6 AD and 3 HC HIC samples. The methylation analysis was carried out by means of pyrosequencing. In AD PBMCs we found that R1 region displayed a higher methylation level, while the opposite trend was observed in R2. The presence of ε4 allele highlighted a marked increase in R1 methylation level and a decrease in R2. In AD PBMCs and HIC, age progression resulted to be associated with an increase in the methylation level of R1. Lastly, the methylation of a CpG site in R2 was found to be related to CSF biomarkers. Despite the lack of a statistical significance, the outcome from this exploratory analysis highlighted the presence of a difference in methylation in APOE 5'UTR in PBMCs of AD patients which seemed to be associated also with APOE genotype, age and CSF biomarkers level.",2024,,,"Gerlando, RD; Dragoni, F; Rizzo, B; Ferrari, RR; Zardini, E; Ramusino, MC; Perini, G; Costa, A; Poloni, TE; Pansarasa, O; Davin, A; Gagliardi, S"
Prospects and challenges in using neuronal extracellular vesicles in biomarker research.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promise as a source of disease biomarkers. The diverse molecular cargo of EVs can potentially indicate the status of their tissue of origin, even against the complex background of whole plasma. The main tools currently available for assessing biomarkers of brain health include brain imaging and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Given the costs and difficulties associated with these methods, isolation of EVs of neuronal origin (NEVs) from the blood is an attractive approach to identify brain-specific biomarkers. This perspective describes current key challenges in EV- and NEV-based biomarker research. These include the relative low abundance of EVs, the lack of validated isolation methods, and the difficult search for an adequate target for immunocapturing NEVs. We discuss that these challenges must be addressed before NEVs can fulfill their potential for biomarker research. HIGHLIGHTS: NEVs are promising sources of biomarkers for brain disorders. Immunocapturing NEVs from complex biofluids presents several challenges. The choice of surface target for capture will determine NEV yield. Contamination by non-EV sources is relevant for biomarkers at low concentrations.",2024,biomarkers; central nervous system; neurodegenerative disorders; neuronal‐enriched extracellular vesicles,,"Rocha, DAS; Santos, LE; Da Fonseca, PB; De Felice, FG"
A Comprehensive Head-to-Head Comparison of Key Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 Biomarker Tests.,"Plasma phosphorylated-tau 217 (p-tau217) is currently the most promising biomarkers for reliable detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Various p-tau217 assays have been developed, but their relative performance is unclear. We compared key plasma p-tau217 tests using cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of amyloid-β (Aβ)-PET, tau-PET, and cognition as outcomes, and benchmarked them against cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker tests. Samples from 998 individuals (mean[range] age 68.5[20.0-92.5], 53% female) from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort were analyzed.

Navigating the Intersection: Diabetes and Alzheimer's Intertwined Relationship.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Diabetes mellitus (DM) exhibit comparable pathophysiological pathways. Genetic abnormalities in APP, PS-1, and PS-2 are linked to AD, with diagnostic aid from CSF and blood biomarkers. Insulin dysfunction, termed ""type 3 diabetes mellitus"" in AD, involves altered insulin signalling and neuronal shrinkage. Insulin influences beta-amyloid metabolism, exacerbating neurotoxicity in AD and amyloid production in DM. Both disorders display impaired glucose transporter expression, hastening cognitive decline. Mitochondrial dysfunction and Toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammation worsen neurodegeneration in both diseases. ApoE4 raises disease risk, especially when coupled with dyslipidemia common in DM. Targeting shared pathways like insulin-degrading enzyme activation and HSP60 holds promise for therapeutic intervention. Recognizing these interconnected mechanisms underscores the imperative for developing tailored treatments addressing the overlapping pathophysiology of AD and DM, offering potential avenues for more effective management of both conditions.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Diabetes mellitus; beta amyloid; insulin resistance; neurodegeneration,,"Kale, MB; Bhondge, HM; Wankhede, NL; Shende, PV; Thanekaer, RP; Aglawe, MM; Rahangdale, SR; Taksande, BG; Pandit, SB; Upaganlawar, AB; Umekar, MJ; Kopalli, SR; Koppula, S"

"Association of triglyceride glucose-body mass index with Alzheimer's disease pathology, cognition and brain structure in non-demented people.","The relationship between the triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) index and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, cognition, and brain structure remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate these associations, focusing on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, cognitive measures, and brain imaging data. Eight hundred and fifty-five non-demented participants were included. Linear regression was used to explore associations between the TyG-BMI index and AD pathology, cognition, and brain structure. The association between the TyG-BMI index and AD risk was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Longitudinal relationships were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. Mediation analyses were conducted to examine AD pathology's potential mediating role between the TyG-BMI index and cognition as well as brain structure.

Genetic and multi-omic resources for Alzheimer disease and related dementia from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center.,"The Knight-Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC) at Washington University in St. Louis has pioneered and led worldwide seminal studies that have expanded our clinical, social, pathological, and molecular understanding of Alzheimer Disease. Over more than 40 years, research volunteers have been recruited to participate in cognitive, neuropsychologic, imaging, fluid biomarkers, genomic and multi-omic studies. Tissue and longitudinal data collected to foster, facilitate, and support research on dementia and aging. The Genetics and high throughput -omics core (GHTO) have collected of more than 26,000 biological samples from 6,625 Knight-ADRC participants. Samples available include longitudinal DNA, RNA, non-fasted plasma, cerebrospinal fluid pellets, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The GHTO has performed deep molecular profiling (genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) from large number of brain (n = 2,117), CSF (n = 2,012) and blood/plasma (n = 8,265) samples with the goal of identifying novel risk and protective variants, identify novel molecular biomarkers and causal and druggable targets.

Unraveling the Potential Underlying Mechanisms of Mild Behavioral Impairment: Focusing on Amyloid and Tau Pathology.,"The emergence of sustained neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) among non-demented individuals in later life, defined as mild behavioral impairment (MBI), is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unexplored. A growing body of evidence has shown that MBI is associated with alterations in structural and functional neuroimaging studies, higher genetic predisposition to clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as amyloid and tau pathology assessed in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging and neuropathological examination. These findings shed more light on the MBI-related potential neurobiological mechanisms, paving the way for the development of targeted pharmacological approaches. In this review, we aim to discuss the available clinical evidence on the role of amyloid and tau pathology in MBI and the potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, disruption of neurotrophic factors, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), abnormal neuroinflammatory responses including the kynurenine pathway, dysregulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1), epigenetic alterations including micro-RNA (miR)-451a and miR-455-3p, synaptic dysfunction, imbalance in neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and norepinephrine, as well as altered locus coeruleus (LC) integrity are some of the potential mechanisms connecting MBI with amyloid and tau pathology. The elucidation of the underlying neurobiology of MBI would facilitate the design and efficacy of relative clinical trials, especially towards amyloid- or tau-related pathways. In addition, we provide insights for future research into our deeper understanding of its underlying pathophysiology of MBI, and discuss relative therapeutic implications.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid pathology; dementia; mild behavioral impairment; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychiatric symptoms; preclinical AD; prodromal AD; tau pathology,Humans; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Angelopoulou, E; Bougea, A; Hatzimanolis, A; Scarmeas, N; Papageorgiou, SG"

Evaluation of core Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in saliva and plasma measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays on a fully automated platform.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid peptide beta-42 (Aβ42), Aβ42/40 ratio, and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are precious tools for supporting AD diagnosis. However, their use in clinical practice is limited due to the invasiveness of CSF collection. Thus, there is intensive research to find alternative, noninvasive, and widely accessible biological matrices to measure AD core biomarkers. In this study, we measured AD core biomarkers in saliva and plasma by a fully automated platform. We enrolled all consecutive patients with cognitive decline. For each patient, we measured Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau levels in CSF, saliva, and plasma by Lumipulse G1200 (Fujirebio). We included forty-two patients, of whom 27 had AD. Levels of all biomarkers significantly differed in the three biofluids, with saliva having the lowest and CSF the highest levels of Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau. A positive correlation of pTau, Aβ42/40 ratio, and pTau/Aβ42 ratio levels in CSF and plasma was detected, while no correlation between any biomarker in CSF and saliva was found. Our findings suggest that plasma but not saliva could represent a surrogate biofluid for measuring core AD biomarkers. Specifically, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, pTau/Aβ42 ratio, and pTau could serve as surrogates of the corresponding CSF biomarkers.",2024,AD; Beta-amyloid; Biomarker; Fujirebio; Plasma; Saliva; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Saliva; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments; Luminescent Measurements; Aged, 80 and over","Agnello, L; Giglio, RV; Del Ben, F; Piccoli, T; Colletti, T; Scazzone, C; Lo Sasso, B; Ciaccio, AM; Gambino, CM; Salemi, G; Ciaccio, M"
Clinical and diagnostic implications of Alzheimer's disease copathology in Lewy body disease.,"Concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is a frequent event in the context of Lewy body disease (LBD), occurring in approximately half of all cases. Evidence shows that LBD patients with AD copathology show an accelerated disease course, a greater risk of cognitive decline and an overall poorer prognosis. However, LBD-AD cases may show heterogeneous motor and non-motor phenotypes with higher risk of dementia, and, consequently, be not rarely misdiagnosed. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art on LBD-AD by discussing the synergistic effects between AD neuropathological changes and Lewy pathology and their clinical relevance. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers under assessment in LBD-AD and their possible diagnostic and prognostic value. AD pathology can be suspected in vivo by means of CSF, MRI and PET markers, whereas α-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAAs) represent to date the most promising technique to identify Lewy pathology in different biological tissues. Pathological imaging and CSF AD biomarkers are associated with a higher likelihood of cognitive decline in LBD but do not always mirror the neuropathological severity like in pure AD. The implementation of blood-based biomarkers of AD might allow the fast screening of LBD patients for AD copathology, thus improving the overall diagnostic sensitivity for LBD-AD. Finally, we discuss the literature on novel candidate biomarkers being exploited in LBD-AD to investigate other aspects of neurodegeneration, such as neuroaxonal injury, glial activation and synaptic dysfunction. The thorough characterization of AD copathology in LBD should be taken into account for the differential diagnosis of dementia syndromes, for the prognostic evaluation on an individual level and for guiding symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies.",2024,PET; Parkinson’s disease; biomarkers; dementia with Lewy body; neurofilament; α-synuclein SAAs,,"Barba, L; Abu-Rumeileh, S; Barthel, H; Massa, F; Foschi, M; Bellomo, G; Gaetani, L; Thal, DR; Parnetti, L; Otto, M"
Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: Towards accuracy and accessibility.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious dementia afflicting aging population and is characterized by cognitive decline, amyloid-β plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. AD substantially impairs the life quality of the victims and poses a heavy burden on the society at large. The number of people with dementia due to AD, prodromal AD, and preclinical AD is estimated to stand at roughly 3.2, 69, and 315 million worldwide, respectively. Current clinical diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, and clinical research demonstrated that positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers had excellent diagnostic performance. However, the application of CSF biomarker tests and PET are restricted by the invasiveness and high cost. The presence of clinical symptoms means that AD pathology has been progressing for many years, and only a few drugs have been approved for the traetemnt of AD. Therefore, early diagnosis is extremely important for controlling the outcomes caused by AD. In this review, we provided an overview of developing clinical diagnostic criteria, diagnostic strategies under clinical research, developing blood based-biomarker assays, and promising nanotechnologically-based assays.",2024,Alzheimer’s Disease; Biomarker; Detection methods; Diagnostic criteria; the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association,,"Mu, Y; Chang, KX; Chen, YF; Yan, K; Wang, CX; Hua, Q"
Detection of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers changes of Alzheimer's disease using a cognitive stress test in persons with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.,"Timely and accurate diagnosis of the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critically important. Cognitive challenge tests such as the Loewenstein Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) have shown favorable diagnostic properties in a number of previous investigations using amyloid or FDG PET. However, no studies have examined LASSI-L performance against cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD, which can be affected before the distribution of fibrillar amyloid and other changes that can be observed in brain neuroimaging. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between LASSI-L scores and CSF biomarkers and the capacity of the cognitive challenge test to detect the presence of amyloid and tau deposition in patients with subjective cognitive decline and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; memory; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychological assessment; semantic interference,,"Valles-Salgado, M; Gil-Moreno, MJ; Curiel Cid, RE; Delgado-Álvarez, A; Ortega-Madueño, I; Delgado-Alonso, C; Palacios-Sarmiento, M; López-Carbonero, JI; Cárdenas, MC; Matías-Guiu, J; Díez-Cirarda, M; Loewenstein, DA; Matias-Guiu, JA"
Predicting Alzheimer's disease CSF core biomarkers: a multimodal Machine Learning approach.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Current core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, widely employed for diagnosis, require a lumbar puncture to be performed, making them impractical as screening tools. Considering the role of sleep disturbances in AD, recent research suggests quantitative sleep electroencephalography features as potential non-invasive biomarkers of AD pathology. However, quantitative analysis of comprehensive polysomnography (PSG) signals remains relatively understudied. PSG is a non-invasive test enabling qualitative and quantitative analysis of a wide range of parameters, offering additional insights alongside other biomarkers. Machine Learning (ML) gained interest for its ability to discern intricate patterns within complex datasets, offering promise in AD neuropathology detection. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal ML approach in predicting core AD CSF biomarkers.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; CSF biomarkers; Machine Learning; biomechanism; diagnosis; neurodegeneration; quantitative polysomnographic signal analysis; therapeutic target,,"Gaeta, AM; Quijada-López, M; Barbé, F; Vaca, R; Pujol, M; Minguez, O; Sánchez-de-la-Torre, M; Muñoz-Barrutia, A; Piñol-Ripoll, G"
Exploratory Mass Spectrometry of Cerebrospinal Fluid from Persons with Autopsy-Confirmed LATE-NC.,"Common neuropathologies associated with dementia include Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). Biofluid proteomics provides a window into the pathobiology of dementia and the information from biofluid tests may help guide clinical management. Participants (n = 29) had been autopsied and had antemortem CSF draws in a longitudinal cohort of older adults at the University of Kentucky AD Research Center. Cases were designated as LATE-NC + if they had LATE-NC stage > 1 (n = 9); the remaining 20 cases were designated LATE-NC-. This convenience sample of CSF specimens was analyzed in two separate processes: From one group, aliquots were depleted of highly abundant proteins using affinity spin columns. Tryptic digests of sample proteins were subjected to liquid chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry. Relative quantification was performed using Sciex software. Peptides referent to a total of 949 proteins were identified in the samples depleted of abundant proteins, and 820 different proteins were identified in the non-depleted samples. When the Bonferroni/false-discovery statistical correction was applied to account for having made multiple comparison tests, only 4 proteins showed differential expression (LATE-NC + vs LATE-NC-) in the non-depleted samples (RBP4, MIF, IGHG3, and ITM2B). Post hoc western blots confirmed that RBP4 expression was higher in the LATE-NC + cases at the group level. In summary, an exploratory assessment of proteomes of autopsy-confirmed LATE-NC and non-LATE-NC CSF did not demonstrate a clear-cut proteomic fingerprint that distinguished the two groups. There was, however, an increase in RBP4 protein levels in CSF from LATE-NC cases.",2024,Adipokine; Aging; BRI2; Biomarker; CNDP1; RET4,"Humans; Aged; Male; Female; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma; Alzheimer Disease; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Proteome; Dementia","Gal, J; Vary, C; Gartner, CA; Jicha, GA; Abner, EL; Ortega, YS; Choucair, I; Wilcock, DM; Nelson, RS; Nelson, PT"
Multiplex cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identifies biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease.,"Recent expansion of proteomic coverage opens unparalleled avenues to unveil new biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among 6,361 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins analysed from the ADNI database, YWHAG performed best in diagnosing both biologically (AUC = 0.969) and clinically (AUC = 0.857) defined AD. Four- (YWHAG, SMOC1, PIGR and TMOD2) and five- (ACHE, YWHAG, PCSK1, MMP10 and IRF1) protein panels greatly improved the accuracy to 0.987 and 0.975, respectively. Their superior performance was validated in an independent external cohort and in discriminating autopsy-confirmed AD versus non-AD, rivalling even canonical CSF ATN biomarkers. Moreover, they effectively predicted the clinical progression to AD dementia and were strongly associated with AD core biomarkers and cognitive decline. Synaptic, neurogenic and infectious pathways were enriched in distinct AD stages. Mendelian randomization did not support the significant genetic link between CSF proteins and AD. Our findings revealed promising high-performance biomarkers for AD diagnosis and prediction, with implications for clinical trials targeting different pathomechanisms.",2024,,,"Guo, Y; Chen, SD; You, J; Huang, SY; Chen, YL; Zhang, Y; Wang, LB; He, XY; Deng, YT; Zhang, YR; Huang, YY; Dong, Q; Feng, JF; Cheng, W; Yu, JT"
Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common neurodegenerative disorders. AD is characterized by deposition of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, leading to associated secondary pathologies, progressive neurodegeneration, and eventually death. Currently used diagnostics are largely image-based, lack accuracy and do not detect early disease, ie, prior to onset of symptoms, thus limiting treatment options and outcomes. Although biomarkers such as amyloid-β and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid have gained much attention, these are generally limited to disease progression. Unfortunately, identification of biomarkers for early and accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. As such, body fluids such as sweat, serum, saliva, mucosa, tears, and urine are under investigation as alternative sources for biomarkers that can aid in early disease detection. This review focuses on biomarkers identified through proteomics in various biofluids and their potential for early and accurate diagnosis of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biofluid; Biomarker; Blood; CSF; Diagnosis; Saliva; Sweat; Tears,,"Rajendran, K; Krishnan, UM"

Investigating the Impact of Intracerebroventricular Streptozotocin on Female Rats with and without Ovaries: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.,"To contribute to research on female models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), our aim was to study the effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in female rats, and to evaluate a potential neuroprotective action of ovarian steroids against STZ. Female rats were either ovariectomized (OVX) or kept with ovaries (Sham) two weeks before ICV injections. Animals were injected with either vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid, aCSF) or STZ (3 mg/kg) and separated into four experimental groups: Sham + aCSF, Sham + STZ, OVX + aCSF and OVX + STZ. Nineteen days post-injection, we assessed different behavioral aspects: burying, anxiety and exploration, object recognition memory, spatial memory, and depressive-like behavior. Immunohistochemistry and Immunoblot analyses were performed in the hippocampus to examine changes in AD-related proteins and neuronal and microglial populations. STZ affected burying and exploratory behavior depending on ovarian status, and impaired recognition but not spatial memory. STZ and ovariectomy increased depressive-like behavior. Interestingly, STZ did not alter the expression of β-amyloid peptide or Tau phosphorylated forms. STZ affected the neuronal population from the Dentate Gyrus, where immature neurons were more vulnerable to STZ in OVX rats. Regarding microglia, STZ increased reactive cells, and the OVX + STZ group showed an increase in the total cell number. In sum, STZ partially affected female rats, compared to what was previously reported for males. Although AD is more frequent in women, reports about the effect of ICV-STZ in female rats are scarce. Our work highlights the need to deepen into the effects of STZ in the female brain and study possible sex differences.",2024,Behavioral tests; Hippocampus; Neurodegeneration; Ovariectomy; Reactive microglia,,"López Hanotte, J; Peralta, F; Reggiani, PC; Zappa Villar, MF"
Identification of Parkinson's disease PACE subtypes and repurposing treatments through integrative analyses of multimodal data.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder marked by significant clinical and progression heterogeneity. This study aimed at addressing heterogeneity of PD through integrative analysis of various data modalities. We analyzed clinical progression data (≥5 years) of individuals with de novo PD using machine learning and deep learning, to characterize individuals' phenotypic progression trajectories for PD subtyping. We discovered three pace subtypes of PD exhibiting distinct progression patterns: the Inching Pace subtype (PD-I) with mild baseline severity and mild progression speed; the Moderate Pace subtype (PD-M) with mild baseline severity but advancing at a moderate progression rate; and the Rapid Pace subtype (PD-R) with the most rapid symptom progression rate. We found cerebrospinal fluid P-tau/α-synuclein ratio and atrophy in certain brain regions as potential markers of these subtypes. Analyses of genetic and transcriptomic profiles with network-based approaches identified molecular modules associated with each subtype. For instance, the PD-R-specific module suggested STAT3, FYN, BECN1, APOA1, NEDD4, and GATA2 as potential driver genes of PD-R. It also suggested neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, metabolism, PI3K/AKT, and angiogenesis pathways as potential drivers for rapid PD progression (i.e., PD-R).

The anti-inflammatory effects of itaconate and its derivatives in neurological disorders.,"Almost 16 % of the global population is affected by neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative and cerebral neuroimmune diseases, triggered by acute or chronic inflammation. Neuroinflammation is recognized as a common pathogenic mechanism in a wide array of neurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. Inflammatory process in the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to neuronal damage and neuronal apoptosis, consequently exacerbating these diseases. Itaconate, an immunomodulatory metabolite from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, suppresses neuroinflammation and modulates the CNS immune response. Emerging human studies suggest that itaconate levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid may serve as biomarkers associated with inflammatory responses in neurological disorders. Preclinical studies have shown that itaconate and its highly cell-permeable derivatives are promising candidates for preventing and treating neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders. The underlying mechanism may involve the regulation of immune cells in the CNS and neuroinflammation-related signaling pathways and molecules including Nrf2/KEAP1 signaling pathway, reactive oxygen species, and NLRP3 inflammasome. Here, we introduce the metabolism and function of itaconate and the synthesis and development of its derivatives. We summarize the potential impact and therapeutic potential of itaconate and its derivatives on brain immune cells and the associated signaling pathways and molecules, based on preclinical evidence via various neurological disorder models. We also discuss the challenges and potential solutions for clinical translation to promote further research on itaconate and its derivatives for neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders.",2024,Itaconate; NLRP3 inflammasome; Neuroinflammation; Neurological disorders; Nrf2/KEAP1 signaling pathway; Reactive oxygen species,,"Kong, X; Xu, L; Mou, Z; Lyu, W; Shan, K; Wang, L; Liu, F; Rong, F; Li, J; Wei, P"
Assessing CT-based Volumetric Analysis via Transfer Learning with MRI and Manual Labels for Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"Brain computed tomography (CT) is an accessible and commonly utilized technique for assessing brain structure. In cases of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), the presence of ventriculomegaly is often neuroradiologically evaluated by visual rating and manually measuring each image. Previously, we have developed and tested a deep-learning-model that utilizes transfer learning from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CT-based intracranial tissue segmentation. Accordingly, herein we aimed to enhance the segmentation of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (VCSF) in brain CT scans and assess the performance of automated brain CT volumetrics in iNPH patient diagnostics.",2024,CNNs; CT; MRI; deep learning; hydrocephalus; volumetry,,"Srikrishna, M; Seo, W; Zettergren, A; Kern, S; Cantré, D; Gessler, F; Sotoudeh, H; Seidlitz, J; Bernstock, JD; Wahlund, LO; Westman, E; Skoog, I; Virhammar, J; Fällmar, D; Schöll, M"

High levels of neurofilament light and YKL-40 in cerebrospinal fluid are related to poor outcome in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disease without effective treatment. No pathognomonic test can diagnose ALS in sporadic cases. Routine investigation in suspected cases includes neurological examination, imaging of the brain and spine and electromyography supported by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses. The ALS diagnosis is made by clinical judgement and results from examinations. We aimed to study if the CSF biomarkers neurofilament light protein (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), YKL-40, soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) α and β, and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) were associated with ALS diagnosis and could predict disease progression. Eighty-one patients with suspected ALS were included after referral to the neurological clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Fifty-nine patients were diagnosed having ALS, while 22 patients were given alternative diagnoses and labeled ALS mimics. Finally, 25 age-matched neurologically intact individuals were used as controls. ALS patients had significantly higher CSF levels of NFL than controls and mimics. Levels of YKL-40 and GFAP were significantly higher in ALS patients compared with controls. No difference was found between study groups when comparing levels of sAPPα, sAPPβ and sTREM2. Further, elevated levels of NFL and YKL-40 were associated with an increased hazard of death and the annual decline in ALSFRS-R. We also found that patients with elevated levels of both NFL and YKL-40 had a particularly poor prognosis. The results demonstrate the usefulness of CSF biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognostication of ALS.",2024,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Brain damage markers; Diagnosis; GFAP; Neurofilament light protein; Prognosis; YKL-40,,"Rosén, C; Mitre, B; Nellgård, B; Axelsson, M; Constantinescu, R; Andersen, PM; Dalla, K; Blennow, K; Nilsson, G; Zetterberg, H; Rosén, H"

Early-onset Alzheimer dementia superimposed on schizophrenia: a rare case report.,"Disorganized behavior is a primary sign of schizophrenia. Yet it is not unique to schizophrenia. Recently, there has been a growing understanding that endogenous mental disorders could be a prodromal stage of neurodegenerative dementia. As a result, the connection between endogenous mental disorders and dementia has become a subject of significant interest. In the present study, a 49-year-old female with schizophrenia since the age of 17 was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease after a detailed examination with PET and cerebrospinal fluid, despite suspicion of organic disease due to progressive forgetfulness, abnormal behavior and delusions. Schizophrenia is not the only disorder in which disorganized behavior is seen. When such a clinical phenomenon develops, other possible causes should be considered.

The Relationship between SNAP25 and Some Common Human Neurological Syndromes.,"Over the years, research on the pathogenesis of neurological diseases has progressed slowly worldwide. However, as the incidence rate continues to increase and the disease gradually develops, early diagnosis and treatment have become a top priority. SANP25, a protein present on the presynaptic membrane and involved in neurotransmitter release, is closely related to the loss or abnormal expression of synapses and neurons. SNAP25 deficiency can lead to synaptic disorders and inhibit neurotransmitter release. Therefore, a large amount of literature believes that SNAP25 gene mutation is a risk factor for many neurological diseases. This review used advanced search on PubMed to conduct extensive article searches for relevant literature. The search keywords included SNAP25 and Alzheimer's disease, SNAP25 and Parkinson's disease, and so on. After reading and summarizing the previous papers, the corresponding conclusions were obtained to achieve the purpose of the review. The deficiency or variation of SNAP25 might be related to the onset of schizophrenia, epilepsy, attention deficit/hypoactivity disorder, bipolar disorder effective disorder, and autism. SNAP25 has been found to be used as a neuropathological marker for neurological diseases, which could be the target of diagnosis or treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

Serum and CSF metabolomics analysis shows Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates risk factors of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a person's dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KD's metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.",2024,Diseases; Metabolomics,,"Schweickart, A; Batra, R; Neth, BJ; Martino, C; Shenhav, L; Zhang, AR; Shi, P; Karu, N; Huynh, K; Meikle, PJ; Schimmel, L; Dilmore, AH; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Blach, C; Dorrestein, PC; Knight, R; Craft, S; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Krumsiek, J"
A methodology to globally assess ectodomain shedding using soluble fractions from the mouse brain.,"Ectodomain shedding (ES) is a fundamental process involving the proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound proteins, leading to the release of soluble extracellular fragments (shed ectodomains) with potential paracrine and autocrine signaling functions. In the central nervous system (CNS), ES plays pivotal roles in brain development, axonal regulation, synapse formation, and disease pathogenesis, spanning from cancer to Alzheimer's disease. Recent evidence also suggests its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental conditions like autism and schizophrenia. Past investigations of ES in the CNS have primarily relied on cell culture supernatants or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, but these methods have limitations, offering limited insights into how ES is modulated in the intact brain parenchyma. In this study, we introduce a methodology for analyzing shed ectodomains globally within rodent brain samples. Through biochemical tissue subcellular separation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis, we show that the brain's soluble fraction sheddome shares significant molecular and functional similarities with ",2024,biomarkers; central nervous system; ectodomain shedding; mass spectrometry; neuropsychiatric disorders; pharmacological targets; sheddome,,"Lobete, M; Salinas, T; Izquierdo-Bermejo, S; Socas, S; Oset-Gasque, MJ; Martín-de-Saavedra, MD"

Neuroimaging biomarkers and CSF sTREM2 levels in Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal study.,"Understanding the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the involvement of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) related microglia activation is crucial for the development of clinical trials targeting microglia activation at different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the contradictory findings in the literature, it is imperative to investigate the longitudinal alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels as a marker for microglia activation, and its potential association with AD biomarkers, in order to address the current knowledge gap. In this study, we aimed to assess the longitudinal changes in CSF sTREM2 levels within the framework of the A/T/N classification system for AD biomarkers and to explore potential associations with AD pathological features, including the presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau aggregates. The baseline and longitudinal (any available follow-up visit) CSF sTREM2 levels and processed tau-PET and Aβ-PET data of 1001 subjects were recruited from the ADNI database. The participants were classified into four groups based on the A/T/N framework: A+ /TN+ , A+ /TN- , A- /TN+ , and A- /TN- . Linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between CSF sTREM2 with cognitive performance, tau and Aβ-PET adjusting for age, gender, education, and APOE ε4 status. Based on our analysis there was a significant difference in baseline and rate of change of CSF sTREM2 between ATN groups. While there was no association between baseline CSF sTREM2 and cognitive performance (ADNI-mem), we found that the rate of change of CSF sTREM2 is significantly associated with cognitive performance in the entire cohort but not the ATN groups. We found that the baseline CSF sTREM2 is significantly associated with baseline tau-PET and Aβ-PET rate of change only in the A+ /TN+ group. A significant association was found between the rate of change of CSF sTREM2 and the tau- and Aβ-PET rate of change only in the A+ /TN- group. Our study suggests that the TREM2-related microglia activation and their relations with AD markers and cognitive performance vary the in presence or absence of Aβ and tau pathology. Furthermore, our findings revealed that a faster increase in the level of CSF sTREM2 might attenuate future Aβ plaque formation and tau aggregate accumulation only in the presence of Aβ pathology.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid βeta; Microglia; TREM2; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Receptors, Immunologic; Membrane Glycoproteins; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Aged; Longitudinal Studies; tau Proteins; Neuroimaging; Aged, 80 and over; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Positron-Emission Tomography; Plaque, Amyloid; Microglia","Nabizadeh, F; Seyedmirzaei, H; Karami, S"

Prolonged ventricular repolarization associated with mild cognitive impairment and white matter hyperintensities: a cross-sectional study.,"Prolonged ventricular repolarization has been associated with cardiovascular disease. We sought to investigate the association of prolonged ventricular repolarization with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the potential underlying neuropathological mechanisms in older adults. This cross-sectional study included 4328 dementia-free participants (age ≥ 65 years; 56.8% female) in the baseline examination of the Multidomain INterventions to delay dementia and Disability in rural China; of these, 989 undertook structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. QT, QTc, JT, JTc, and QRS intervals were derived from 12-lead electrocardiograph. MCI, amnestic MCI (aMCI), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) were defined following the Petersen's criteria. Volumes of gray matter (GM), white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, total white matter hyperintensities (WMH), periventricular WMH (PWMH), and deep WMH (DWMH) were automatically estimated. Data were analyzed using logistic and general linear regression models. Prolonged QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of MCI and aMCI, but not naMCI (p < 0.05). In the MRI subsample, QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals were significantly associated with larger total WMH and PWMH volumes (p < 0.05), but not with DWMH volume. Statistical interactions were detected, such that prolonged QT and JT intervals were significantly associated with reduced GM volume only among participants with coronary heart disease or without APOE ε4 allele (p < 0.05).

Microarray Chip-Based High-Throughput Screening of Neurofilament Light Chain Self-Assembling Peptide for Noninvasive Monitoring of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) starts decades before cognitive symptoms develop. Easily accessible and cost-effective biomarkers that accurately reflect AD pathology are essential for both monitoring and therapeutics of AD. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid are increased in AD more than a decade before the expected onset, thus providing one of the most promising blood biomarkers for monitoring of AD. The clinical practice of employing single-molecule array (Simoa) technology for routine use in patient care is limited by the high costs. Herein, we developed a microarray chip-based high-throughput screening method and screened an attractive self-assembling peptide targeting NfL. Through directly ""imprinting"" and further analyzing the sequences, morphology, and affinity of the identified self-assembling peptides, the Pep-NfL peptide nanosheet with high binding affinity toward NfL (",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; blood biomarker; imprinting; neurofilament light chain; self-assembly peptide,Alzheimer Disease; Neurofilament Proteins; Animals; Humans; Mice; Peptides; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Biomarkers; Protein Array Analysis,"Zhou, Y; Cai, G; Wang, Y; Guo, Y; Yang, Z; Wang, A; Chen, Y; Li, X; Chen, X; Hu, Z; Wang, Z"

Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's Association Workgroup.,"The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened three separate work groups in 2011 and single work groups in 2012 and 2018 to create recommendations for the diagnosis and characterization of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present document updates the 2018 research framework in response to several recent developments. Defining diseases biologically, rather than based on syndromic presentation, has long been standard in many areas of medicine (e.g., oncology), and is becoming a unifying concept common to all neurodegenerative diseases, not just AD. The present document is consistent with this principle. Our intent is to present objective criteria for diagnosis and staging AD, incorporating recent advances in biomarkers, to serve as a bridge between research and clinical care. These criteria are not intended to provide step-by-step clinical practice guidelines for clinical workflow or specific treatment protocols, but rather serve as general principles to inform diagnosis and staging of AD that reflect current science. HIGHLIGHTS: We define Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be a biological process that begins with the appearance of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC) while people are asymptomatic. Progression of the neuropathologic burden leads to the later appearance and progression of clinical symptoms. Early-changing Core 1 biomarkers (amyloid positron emission tomography [PET], approved cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and accurate plasma biomarkers [especially phosphorylated tau 217]) map onto either the amyloid beta or AD tauopathy pathway; however, these reflect the presence of ADNPC more generally (i.e., both neuritic plaques and tangles). An abnormal Core 1 biomarker result is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of AD and to inform clinical decision making throughout the disease continuum. Later-changing Core 2 biomarkers (biofluid and tau PET) can provide prognostic information, and when abnormal, will increase confidence that AD is contributing to symptoms. An integrated biological and clinical staging scheme is described that accommodates the fact that common copathologies, cognitive reserve, and resistance may modify relationships between clinical and biological AD stages.",2024,Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; Alzheimer's disease imaging; Alzheimer's disease staging; amyloid positron emission tomography; biofluid biomarkers Alzheimer's disease; biomarkers Alzheimer's disease; preclinical Alzheimer's disease; tau positron emission tomography,,"Jack, CR; Andrews, JS; Beach, TG; Buracchio, T; Dunn, B; Graf, A; Hansson, O; Ho, C; Jagust, W; McDade, E; Molinuevo, JL; Okonkwo, OC; Pani, L; Rafii, MS; Scheltens, P; Siemers, E; Snyder, HM; Sperling, R; Teunissen, CE; Carrillo, MC"
Exploring Inner Ear and Brain Connectivity through Perilymph Sampling for Early Detection of Neurological Diseases: A Provocative Proposal.,"Recent evidence shows that it is possible to identify the elements responsible for sensorineural hearing loss, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophages, by performing perilymph sampling. However, current studies have only focused on the diagnosis of such as otologic conditions. Hearing loss is a feature of certain neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is widely detected in Alzheimer's disease. Although the environment of the inner ear is highly regulated, there are several communication pathways between the perilymph of the inner ear and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus, examination of the perilymph may help understand the mechanism behind the hearing loss observed in certain neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we review the constituents of CSF and perilymph, the anatomy of the inner ear and its connection with the brain. Then, we discuss the relevance of perilymph sampling in neurology. Currently, perilymph sampling is only performed during surgical procedures, but we hypothesize a simplified and low-invasive technique that could allow sampling in a clinical setting with the same ease as performing an intratympanic injection under direct visual check. The use of this modified technique could allow for perilymph sampling in people with hearing loss and neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative disorders and clarify the relationship between these conditions; in fact, by measuring the concentration of neuroinflammatory and/or neurodegenerative biomarkers and those typically expressed in the inner ear in aging SNHL, it could be possible to understand if SNHL is caused by aging or neuroinflammation.",2024,CSF; brain; neurodegeneration; neuroinflammation; perilymph,,"Di Stadio, A; Ralli, M; Kaski, D; Koohi, N; Gioacchini, FM; Kysar, JW; Lalwani, AK; Warnecke, A; Bernitsas, E"
"Research Progress on the Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Drug Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease.","As the population ages worldwide, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent kind of neurodegenerative disorder among older people, has become a significant factor affecting quality of life, public health, and economies. However, the exact pathogenesis of Alzheimer's remains elusive, and existing highly recognized pathogenesis includes the amyloid cascade hypothesis, Tau neurofibrillary tangles hypothesis, and neuroinflammation hypothesis. The major diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease include neuroimaging positron emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid molecular diagnosis. The therapy of Alzheimer's disease primarily relies on drugs, and the approved drugs on the market include acetylcholinesterase drugs, glutamate receptor antagonists, and amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies. Still, the existing drugs can only alleviate the symptoms of the disease and cannot completely reverse it. This review aims to summarize existing research results on Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and drug therapy, with the objective of facilitating future research in this area.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; diagnosis; drug therapy; pathogenesis,,"Yang, Y; Qiu, L"

PTPRS is a novel marker for early Tau pathology and synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease.,"We examined the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTPRS) in the context of Alzheimer's disease and synaptic integrity. Publicly available datasets (BRAINEAC, ROSMAP, ADC1) and a cohort of asymptomatic but ""at risk"" individuals (PREVENT-AD) were used to explore the relationship between PTPRS and various Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. We identified that PTPRS rs10415488 variant C shows features of neuroprotection against early Tau pathology and synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This single nucleotide polymorphism correlated with higher PTPRS transcript abundance and lower p(181)Tau and GAP-43 levels in the CSF. In the brain, PTPRS protein abundance was significantly correlated with the quantity of two markers of synaptic integrity: SNAP25 and SYT-1. We also found the presence of sexual dimorphism for PTPRS, with higher CSF concentrations in males than females. Male carriers for variant C were found to have a 10-month delay in the onset of AD. We thus conclude that PTPRS acts as a neuroprotective receptor in Alzheimer's disease. Its protective effect is most important in males, in whom it postpones the age of onset of the disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Autophagy; Cerebrospinal fluid; Protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptors; Synaptic markers; Tau pathology,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Brain; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2; Synapses; Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25; Synaptotagmin I; tau Proteins","Poirier, A; Picard, C; Labonté, A; Aubry, I; Auld, D; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Tremblay, ML; Poirier, J"

Although biofluid biomarkers are available to measure Aβ and tau pathology, few markers are available to measure the complex pathophysiology that is associated with these two cardinal neuropathologies. Here, we characterized the proteomic landscape of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes associated with Aβ and tau pathology in 300 individuals using two different proteomic technologies-tandem mass tag mass spectrometry and SomaScan. Integration of both data types allowed for generation of a robust protein coexpression network consisting of 34 modules derived from 5242 protein measurements, including disease-relevant modules associated with autophagy, ubiquitination, endocytosis, and glycolysis.

An interpretable machine learning-based cerebrospinal fluid proteomics clock for predicting age reveals novel insights into brain aging.,"Machine learning can be used to create ""biologic clocks"" that predict age. However, organs, tissues, and biofluids may age at different rates from the organism as a whole. We sought to understand how cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes with age to inform the development of brain aging-related disease mechanisms and identify potential anti-aging therapeutic targets. Several epigenetic clocks exist based on plasma and neuronal tissues; however, plasma may not reflect brain aging specifically and tissue-based clocks require samples that are difficult to obtain from living participants. To address these problems, we developed a machine learning clock that uses CSF proteomics to predict the chronological age of individuals with a 0.79 Pearson correlation and mean estimated error (MAE) of 4.30 years in our validation cohort. Additionally, we analyzed proteins highly weighted by the algorithm to gain insights into changes in CSF and uncover novel insights into brain aging. We also demonstrate a novel method to create a minimal protein clock that uses just 109 protein features from the original clock to achieve a similar accuracy (0.75 correlation, MAE 5.41). Finally, we demonstrate that our clock identifies novel proteins that are highly predictive of age in interactions with other proteins, but do not directly correlate with chronological age themselves. In conclusion, we propose that our CSF protein aging clock can identify novel proteins that influence the rate of aging of the central nervous system (CNS), in a manner that would not be identifiable by examining their individual relationships with age.",2024,aging; brain aging; cerebrospinal fluid; neurodegeneration; neurodegenerative diseases; proteomics,,"Melendez, J; Sung, YJ; Orr, M; Yoo, A; Schindler, S; Cruchaga, C; Bateman, R"
A Simple Sandwich Electrochemical Immunosensor for Rapid Detection of the Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Tau Protein.,"As a typical biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, rapid and specific detection of tau protein can help improve the early diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. In this study, a simple sandwich electrochemical immunosensor was developed for rapid detection of tau protein. Primary monoclonal antibodies (mAb1) against the middle domain of tau protein (amino acids 189-195) were immobilized on the gold electrode surface through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 3,3'-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP). Then the tau protein was captured through the specific adsorption between the antigen and the antibody, resulting in a change in the impedance. Secondary monoclonal antibodies (mAb2) against the N-terminal region of tau protein were used for further amplification of the binding reaction between mAb1 and tau protein. A linear correlation between the total change in impedance and the logarithm of tau concentration was found from 2 × 10",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); immunosensor; impedance; sandwich; tau protein,"tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Biosensing Techniques; Biomarkers; Electrochemical Techniques; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Gold; Immunoassay; Limit of Detection; Electrodes","Yang, M; Chen, Y; Sun, H; Li, D; Li, Y"
Lipid-siRNA conjugate accesses a perivascular transport mechanism and achieves widespread and durable knockdown in the central nervous system.,"Short-interfering RNA (siRNA) has gained significant interest for treatment of neurological diseases by providing the capacity to achieve sustained inhibition of nearly any gene target. Yet, achieving efficacious drug delivery throughout deep brain structures of the CNS remains a considerable hurdle. We herein describe a lipid-siRNA conjugate that, following delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is transported effectively through perivascular spaces, enabling broad dispersion within CSF compartments and through the CNS parenchyma. We provide a detailed examination of the temporal kinetics of gene silencing, highlighting potent knockdown for up to five months from a single injection without detectable toxicity.

"A clathrin mediated endocytosis scaffolding protein, Intersectin 1, changes in an isoform, brain region, and sex specific manner in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau tangles in the brain. We previously identified a set of candidate AD microRNAs (miRNAs) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and used a target prediction pipeline to identify mRNAs and pathways that could potentially be regulated by the miRNAs. Of these pathways, clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) was selected for further investigation. CME is altered in multiple brain cell types in AD and is implicated in early cellular phenotypes such as enlarged early endosomes and pathogenic processing of Aβ. However, a comprehensive evaluation of major CME hub proteins in humans with AD across multiple brain regions is lacking. Thus, we used immunoblots to evaluate human post-mortem AD and control (CTL) frontal cortex (FC; AD ",2024,5xFAD; Alzheimer’s disease; Intersectin 1; clathrin mediated endocytosis; human brain,,"Jaye, S; Sandau, US; McFarland, TJ; Woltjer, RL; Saugstad, JA"
Late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy: insights from brain atrophy and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"Considering the growing age of the world population, the incidence of epilepsy in older adults is expected to increase significantly. It has been suggested that late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy (LO-TLE) may be neurodegenerative in origin and overlap with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Herein, we aimed to characterize the pattern of cortical atrophy and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD (total and phosphorylated tau, and β-amyloid) in a selected population of LO-TLE of unknown origin. We prospectively enrolled individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy onset after the age of 50 and no cognitive impairment. They underwent a structural MRI scan and CSF biomarkers measurement. Imaging and biomarkers data were compared to three retrospectively collected groups: (i) age-sex-matched healthy controls, (ii) patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (MCI-AD), and (iii) patients with MCI and normal CSF AD biomarkers (MCI-noAD). From a pool of 52 patients, twenty consecutive eligible LO-TLE patients with a mean disease duration of 1.8 years were recruited. As control populations, 25 patients with MCI-AD, 25 patients with MCI-noAD, and 25 healthy controls were enrolled. CSF biomarkers returned normal values in LO-TLE, significantly different from patients with MCI due to AD. There were no differences in cortico-subcortical atrophy between epilepsy patients and healthy controls, while patients with MCI demonstrated widespread injuries of cortico-subcortical structures. Individuals with a late-onset form of temporal lobe epilepsy, characterized by short disease duration and normal CSF β-amyloid and tau protein levels, showed patterns of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes not significantly different from healthy controls, but highly different from patients with MCI, either due to Alzheimer's Disease or not.",2024,CSF biomarkers; late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy; mild cognitive impairment; phosphorylated tau; structural MRI; β-amyloid,,"Ballerini, A; Biagioli, N; Carbone, C; Chiari, A; Tondelli, M; Vinceti, G; Bedin, R; Malagoli, M; Genovese, M; Scolastico, S; Giovannini, G; Pugnaghi, M; Orlandi, N; Lemieux, L; Meletti, S; Zamboni, G; Vaudano, AE"
Brain Injury Biomarkers and Applications in Neurological Diseases.,"Neurological diseases are a major health concern, and brain injury is a typical pathological process in various neurological disorders. Different biomarkers in the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid are associated with specific physiological and pathological processes. They are vital in identifying, diagnosing, and treating brain injuries. In this review, we described biomarkers for neuronal cell body injury (neuron-specific enolase, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1, αII-spectrin), axonal injury (neurofilament proteins, tau), astrocyte injury (S100β, glial fibrillary acidic protein), demyelination (myelin basic protein), autoantibodies, and other emerging biomarkers (extracellular vesicles, microRNAs). We aimed to summarize the applications of these biomarkers and their related interests and limits in the diagnosis and prognosis for neurological diseases, including traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and infection. In addition, a reasonable outlook for brain injury biomarkers as ideal detection tools for neurological diseases is presented.",2024,,,"Zhang, H; Wang, J; Qu, Y; Yang, Y; Guo, ZN"
Altered brain expression and cerebrospinal fluid levels of TIMP4 in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a highly prevalent and progressive pathology, involving amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the cerebral blood vessel walls. CAA is associated with an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH). Insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with CAA pathology is urgently needed, to develop additional diagnostic tools to allow for reliable and early diagnosis of CAA and to obtain novel leads for the development of targeted therapies. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 4 (TIMP4) is associated with cardiovascular functioning and disease and has been linked to vascular dementia. Using immunohistochemistry, we studied occipital brain tissue samples of 57 patients with CAA (39 without ICH and 18 with ICH) and 42 controls, and semi-quantitatively assessed expression levels of TIMP4.

An interim exploratory proteomics biomarker analysis of a phase 2 clinical trial to assess the impact of CT1812 in Alzheimer's disease.,"CT1812 is a novel, brain penetrant small molecule modulator of the sigma-2 receptor (S2R) that is currently in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical and early clinical data show that, through S2R, CT1812 selectively prevents and displaces binding of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers from neuronal synapses and improves cognitive function in animal models of AD. SHINE is an ongoing phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (COG0201) in participants with mild to moderate AD, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of 6 months of CT1812 treatment. To elucidate the mechanism of action in AD patients and pharmacodynamic biomarkers of CT1812, the present study reports exploratory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data from 18 participants in an interim analysis of the first set of patients in SHINE (part A). Untargeted mass spectrometry-based discovery proteomics detects >2000 proteins in patient CSF and has documented utility in accelerating the identification of novel AD biomarkers reflective of diverse pathophysiologies beyond amyloid and tau, and enabling identification of pharmacodynamic biomarkers in longitudinal interventional trials. We leveraged this technique to analyze CSF samples taken at baseline and after 6 months of CT1812 treatment. Proteome-wide protein levels were detected using tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry (TMT-MS), change from baseline was calculated for each participant, and differential abundance analysis by treatment group was performed. This analysis revealed a set of proteins significantly impacted by CT1812, including pathway engagement biomarkers (i.e., biomarkers tied to S2R biology) and disease modification biomarkers (i.e., biomarkers with altered levels in AD vs. healthy control CSF but normalized by CT1812, and biomarkers correlated with favorable trends in ADAS-Cog11 scores). Brain network mapping, Gene Ontology, and pathway analyses revealed an impact of CT1812 on synapses, lipoprotein and amyloid beta biology, and neuroinflammation. Collectively, the findings highlight the utility of this method in pharmacodynamic biomarker identification and providing mechanistic insights for CT1812, which may facilitate the clinical development of CT1812 and enable appropriate pre-specification of biomarkers in upcoming clinical trials of CT1812.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Aβ oligomers; CSF pharmacodynamic biomarkers; CT1812; Clinical trial; TMT-MS proteomics; Therapeutic,,"Lizama, BN; North, HA; Pandey, K; Williams, C; Duong, D; Cho, E; Di Caro, V; Ping, L; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Lah, J; Levey, AI; Grundman, M; Caggiano, AO; Seyfried, NT; Hamby, ME"

Target engagement and immunogenicity of an active immunotherapeutic targeting pathological α-synuclein: a phase 1 placebo-controlled trial.,"Investigational therapeutics that target toxic species of α-synuclein (αSyn) aim to slow down or halt disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here this 44-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center phase 1 study investigated safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of UB-312, an active immunotherapeutic targeting pathological αSyn, in patients with PD. The primary outcome measures were adverse event frequency and change in anti-αSyn antibody titers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Exploratory outcomes were changes in clinical scales and biomarker-based target engagement as measured by seed amplification assays. Twenty patients were randomized 7:3 (UB-312:placebo) into 300/100/100 μg or 300/300/300 μg (weeks 1, 5 and 13) intramuscular prime-boost dose groups. Safety was similar across groups; adverse events were mostly mild and transient. Two patients experienced three serious adverse events in total, one possibly treatment related; all resolved without sequalae. Anti-αSyn antibodies in serum from 12/13 and CSF from 5/13 patients who received three UB-312 doses confirmed immunogenicity. Mean serum titers (in log-dilution factor) increased from baseline by 1.398 and 1.354, and peaked at week 29 at 2.520 and 2.133, for 300/100/100 μg and 300/300/300 μg, respectively. CSF titers were 0 at baseline and were 0.182 and 0.032 at week 21, respectively.

Brain responses to intermittent fasting and the healthy living diet in older adults.,"Diet may promote brain health in metabolically impaired older individuals. In an 8-week randomized clinical trial involving 40 cognitively intact older adults with insulin resistance, we examined the effects of 5:2 intermittent fasting and the healthy living diet on brain health. Although intermittent fasting induced greater weight loss, the two diets had comparable effects in improving insulin signaling biomarkers in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles, decreasing the brain-age-gap estimate (reflecting the pace of biological aging of the brain) on magnetic resonance imaging, reducing brain glucose on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and improving blood biomarkers of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with minimal changes in cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Intermittent fasting and healthy living improved executive function and memory, with intermittent fasting benefiting more certain cognitive measures. In exploratory analyses, sex, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E and SLC16A7 genotypes modulated diet effects. The study provides a blueprint for assessing brain effects of dietary interventions and motivates further research on intermittent fasting and continuous diets for brain health optimization.

Central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles: the next generation of neural circulating biomarkers?,"The central nervous system (CNS) is integrated by glial and neuronal cells, and both release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in CNS homeostasis. EVs could be one of the best candidates to operate as nanosized biological platforms for analysing multidimensional bioactive cargos, which are protected during systemic circulation of EVs. Having a window into the molecular level processes that are happening in the CNS could open a new avenue in CNS research. This raises a particular point of interest: can CNS-derived EVs in blood serve as circulating biomarkers that reflect the pathological status of neurological diseases? L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) is a widely reported biomarker to identify CNS-derived EVs in peripheral blood. However, it has been demonstrated that L1CAM is also expressed outside the CNS. Given that principal data related to neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease were obtained using L1CAM-positive EVs, efforts to overcome present challenges related to its specificity are required. In this sense, other surface biomarkers for CNS-derived EVs, such as glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), among others, have started to be used. Establishing a panel of EV biomarkers to analyse CNS-derived EVs in blood could increase the specificity and sensitivity necessary for these types of studies. This review covers the main evidence related to CNS-derived EVs in cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples of patients with neurological diseases, focusing on the reported biomarkers and the technical possibilities for their isolation. EVs are emerging as a mirror of brain physiopathology, reflecting both localized and systemic changes. Therefore, when the technical hindrances for EV research and clinical applications are overcome, novel disease-specific panels of EV biomarkers would be discovered to facilitate transformation from traditional medicine to personalized medicine.",2024,Brain-derived EVs; Central nervous system-derived EVs; Cerebrospinal fluid EVs; Circulating biomarkers; Extracellular vesicles; Neural-derived EVs; Neurodegenerative diseases; Plasma EVs,Humans; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Central Nervous System; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Animals,"Bravo-Miana, RDC; Arizaga-Echebarria, JK; Otaegui, D"

Advances in blood biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD): A review.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are growing public health challenges globally affecting millions of older adults, necessitating concerted efforts to advance our understanding and management of these conditions. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles that are the primary cause of dementia in older individuals. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD dementia is crucial for effective intervention and treatment but has proven challenging to accomplish. Although testing for AD brain pathology with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) has been available for over 2 decades, most patients never underwent this testing because of inaccessibility, high out-of-pocket costs, perceived risks, and the lack of AD-specific treatments. However, in recent years, rapid progress has been made in developing blood biomarkers for AD/ADRD. Consequently, blood biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for non-invasive and cost-effective diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of AD progression. This review presents the evolving landscape of blood biomarkers in AD/ADRD and explores their potential applications in clinical practice for early detection, prognosis, and therapeutic interventions. It covers recent advances in blood biomarkers, including amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, tau protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). It also discusses their diagnostic and prognostic utility while addressing associated challenges and limitations.

Real-time quantification of in vivo cerebrospinal fluid velocity using the functional magnetic resonance imaging inflow effect.,"In vivo estimation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocity is crucial for understanding the glymphatic system and its potential role in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Current cardiac or respiratory-gated approaches, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cannot capture CSF movement in real time because of limited temporal resolution and, in addition, deteriorate in accuracy at low fluid velocities. Other techniques like real-time phase-contrast-MRI or time-spatial labeling inversion pulse are not limited by temporal averaging but have limited availability, even in research settings. This study aims to quantify the inflow effect of dynamic CSF motion on functional MRI (fMRI) for in vivo, real-time measurement of CSF flow velocity. We considered linear and nonlinear models of velocity waveforms and empirically fit them to fMRI data from a controlled flow experiment. To assess the utility of this methodology in human data, CSF flow velocities were computed from fMRI data acquired in eight healthy volunteers. Breath-holding regimens were used to amplify CSF flow oscillations. Our experimental flow study revealed that CSF velocity is nonlinearly related to inflow effect-mediated signal increase and well estimated using an extension of a previous nonlinear framework. Using this relationship, we recovered velocity from in vivo fMRI signal, demonstrating the potential of our approach for estimating CSF flow velocity in the human brain. This novel method could serve as an alternative approach to quantifying slow flow velocities in real time, such as CSF flow in the ventricular system, thereby providing valuable insights into the glymphatic system's function and its implications for neurological disorders.",2024,BOLD fMRI; CSF flow; cerebrospinal fluid; inflow effect; respiration; ventricular system,,"Diorio, TC; Nair, VV; Patel, NM; Hedges, LE; Rayz, VL; Tong, Y"

"Increase in wasteosomes (corpora amylacea) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with specific detection of tau, TDP-43 and FUS pathology.","Wasteosomes (or corpora amylacea) are polyglucosan bodies that appear in the human brain with aging and in some neurodegenerative diseases, and have been suggested to have a potential role in a nervous system cleaning mechanism. Despite previous studies in several neurodegenerative disorders, their status in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) remains unexplored. Our study aims to characterize wasteosomes in the three primary FTLD proteinopathies, assessing frequency, distribution, protein detection, and association with aging or disease duration. Wasteosome scores were obtained in various brain regions from 124 post-mortem diagnosed sporadic FTLD patients, including 75 participants with tau (FTLD-tau), 42 with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP), and 7 with Fused in Sarcoma (FTLD-FUS) proteinopathies, along with 29 control subjects. The wasteosome amount in each brain region for the different FLTD patients was assessed with a permutation test with age at death and sex as covariables, and multiple regressions explored associations with age at death and disease duration. Double immunofluorescence studies examined altered proteins linked to FTLD in wasteosomes. FTLD patients showed a higher accumulation of wasteosomes than control subjects, especially those with FTLD-FUS. Unlike FTLD-TDP and control subjects, wasteosome accumulation did not increase with age in FTLD-tau and FTLD-FUS. Cases with shorter disease duration in FTLD-tau and FTLD-FUS seemed to exhibit higher wasteosome quantities, whereas FTLD-TDP appeared to show an increase with disease progression. Immunofluorescence studies revealed the presence of tau and phosphorylated-TDP-43 in the periphery of isolated wasteosomes in some patients with FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, respectively. Central inclusions of FUS were observed in a higher number of wasteosomes in FTLD-FUS patients. These findings suggest a role of wasteosomes in FTLD, especially in the more aggressive forms of FLTD-FUS. Detecting these proteins, particularly FUS, in wasteosomes from cerebrospinal fluid could be a potential biomarker for FTLD.",2024,Corpora amylacea; FUS; Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD); TDP-43; Tau; Wasteosomes,"Humans; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Female; Male; RNA-Binding Protein FUS; Aged; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; DNA-Binding Proteins; Brain","Alsina, R; Riba, M; Pérez-Millan, A; Borrego-Écija, S; Aldecoa, I; Romera, C; Balasa, M; Antonell, A; Lladó, A; Compta, Y; Del Valle, J; Sánchez-Valle, R; Pelegrí, C; Molina-Porcel, L; Vilaplana, J"

Approaches for Increasing Cerebral Efflux of Amyloid-β in Experimental Systems.,"Amyloid protein-β (Aβ) concentrations are increased in the brain in both early onset and late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In early onset AD, cerebral Aβ production is increased and its clearance is decreased, while increased Aβ burden in late onset AD is due to impaired clearance. Aβ has been the focus of AD therapeutics since development of the amyloid hypothesis, but efforts to slow AD progression by lowering brain Aβ failed until phase 3 trials with the monoclonal antibodies lecanemab and donanemab. In addition to promoting phagocytic clearance of Aβ, antibodies lower cerebral Aβ by efflux of Aβ-antibody complexes across the capillary endothelia, dissolving Aβ aggregates, and a ""peripheral sink"" mechanism. Although the blood-brain barrier is the main route by which soluble Aβ leaves the brain (facilitated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 and ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1), Aβ can also be removed via the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, glymphatic drainage, and intramural periarterial drainage. This review discusses experimental approaches to increase cerebral Aβ efflux via these mechanisms, clinical applications of these approaches, and findings in clinical trials with these approaches in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment. Based on negative findings in clinical trials with previous approaches targeting monomeric Aβ, increasing the cerebral efflux of soluble Aβ is unlikely to slow AD progression if used as monotherapy. But if used as an adjunct to treatment with lecanemab or donanemab, this approach might allow greater slowing of AD progression than treatment with either antibody alone.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; blood-brain barrier; blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier; experimental approaches; glymphatic drainage; perivascular drainage),,"Loeffler, DA"

Protein fibril aggregation on red blood cells: a potential biomarker to distinguish neurodegenerative diseases from healthy aging.,"Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins into fibrils in the brain. Atomic force microscopy is a nanoscale imaging technique that can be used to resolve and quantify protein aggregates from oligomers to fibrils. Recently, we characterized protein fibrillar aggregates adsorbed on the surface of red blood cells with atomic force microscopy from patients with neurocognitive disorders, suggesting a novel Alzheimer's disease biomarker. However, the age association of fibril deposits on red blood cells has not yet been studied in detail in healthy adults. Here, we used atomic force microscopy to visualize and quantify fibril coverage on red blood cells in 50 healthy adults and 37 memory clinic patients. Fibrillar protein deposits sporadically appeared in healthy individuals but were much more prevalent in patients with neurodegenerative disease, especially those with Alzheimer's disease as confirmed by positive CSF amyloid beta 1-42/1-40 ratios. The prevalence of fibrils on the red blood cell surface did not significantly correlate with age in either healthy individuals or Alzheimer's disease patients. The overlap in fibril prevalence on red blood cells between Alzheimer's disease and amyloid-negative patients suggests that fibril deposition on red blood cells could occur in various neurodegenerative diseases. Quantifying red blood cell protein fibril morphology and prevalence on red blood cells could serve as a sensitive biomarker for neurodegeneration, distinguishing between healthy individuals and those with neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies that combine atomic force microscopy with immunofluorescence techniques in larger-scale studies could further identify the chemical nature of these fibrils, paving the way for a comprehensive, non-invasive biomarker platform for neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,aging; atomic force microscopy; neurodegenerative diseases; protein fibril aggregation; red blood cells,,"Schneider, TR; Stöckli, L; Felbecker, A; Nirmalraj, PN"
Awareness of episodic memory and meta-cognitive profiles: associations with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers at the preclinical stage of the Alzheimer's continuum.,"The lack of cognitive awareness, anosognosia, is a clinical deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, an increased awareness of cognitive function, hypernosognosia, may serve as a marker in the preclinical stage. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) might correspond to the initial symptom in the dynamic trajectory of awareness, but SCD might be absent along with low awareness of actual cognitive performance in the preclinical stage. We hypothesized that distinct meta-cognitive profiles, both hypernosognosia and anosognosia, might be identified in preclinical-AD.

Enhancing of cerebral Abeta clearance by modulation of ABC transporter expression: a review of experimental approaches.,"Clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) from the brain is impaired in both early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mechanisms for clearing cerebral Aβ include proteolytic degradation, antibody-mediated clearance, blood brain barrier and blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier efflux, glymphatic drainage, and perivascular drainage. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane efflux pumps driven by ATP hydrolysis. Their functions include maintenance of brain homeostasis by removing toxic peptides and compounds, and transport of bioactive molecules including cholesterol. Some ABC transporters contribute to lowering of cerebral Aβ. Mechanisms suggested for ABC transporter-mediated lowering of brain Aβ, in addition to exporting of Aβ across the blood brain and blood cerebrospinal fluid barriers, include apolipoprotein E lipidation, microglial activation, decreased amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein, and restricting the entrance of Aβ into the brain. The ABC transporter superfamily in humans includes 49 proteins, eight of which have been suggested to reduce cerebral Aβ levels. This review discusses experimental approaches for increasing the expression of these ABC transporters, clinical applications of these approaches, changes in the expression and/or activity of these transporters in AD and transgenic mouse models of AD, and findings in the few clinical trials which have examined the effects of these approaches in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment. The possibility that therapeutic upregulation of ABC transporters which promote clearance of cerebral Aβ may slow the clinical progression of AD merits further consideration.",2024,ABC transporters; Abeta; Alzheimer’s; cerebral clearance; experimental approaches,,"Loeffler, DA"

Amino-terminally elongated Aβ peptides are generated by the secreted metalloprotease ADAMTS4 and deposit in a subset of Alzheimer's disease brains.,"The aggregation and deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in the brain is thought to be the initial driver in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aside from full-length Aβ peptides starting with an aspartate residue in position 1, both N-terminally truncated and elongated Aβ peptides are produced by various proteases from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and have been detected in brain tissues and body fluids. Recently, we demonstrated that the particularly abundant N-terminally truncated Aβ4-x peptides are generated by ADAMTS4, a secreted metalloprotease that is exclusively expressed in the oligodendrocyte cell population. In this study, we investigated whether ADAMTS4 might also be involved in the generation of N-terminally elongated Aβ peptides.",2024,ADAMTS4; Alzheimer's disease; Aβ; amyloid precursor protein; immunoassay; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; mass spectrometry,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; ADAMTS4 Protein; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Aged; Male; Female; Aged, 80 and over","Wirths, O; Lehnen, C; Fricke, M; Talucci, I; Klafki, HW; Morgado, B; Lehmann, S; Münch, C; Liepold, T; Wiltfang, J; Rostagno, A; Ghiso, J; Maric, HM; Jahn, O; Weggen, S"
Acceptable performance of blood biomarker tests of amyloid pathology - recommendations from the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Anti-amyloid treatments for early symptomatic Alzheimer disease have recently become clinically available in some countries, which has greatly increased the need for biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology. Blood biomarker (BBM) tests for amyloid pathology are more acceptable, accessible and scalable than amyloid PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, but have highly variable levels of performance. The Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease convened a BBM Workgroup to consider the minimum acceptable performance of BBM tests for clinical use. Amyloid PET status was identified as the reference standard. For use as a triaging test before subsequent confirmatory tests such as amyloid PET or CSF tests, the BBM Workgroup recommends that a BBM test has a sensitivity of ≥90% with a specificity of ≥85% in primary care and ≥75-85% in secondary care depending on the availability of follow-up testing. For use as a confirmatory test without follow-up tests, a BBM test should have performance equivalent to that of CSF tests - a sensitivity and specificity of ~90%. Importantly, the predictive values of all biomarker tests vary according to the pre-test probability of amyloid pathology and must be interpreted in the complete clinical context. Use of BBM tests that meet these performance standards could enable more people to receive an accurate and timely Alzheimer disease diagnosis and potentially benefit from new treatments.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Schindler, SE; Galasko, D; Pereira, AC; Rabinovici, GD; Salloway, S; Suárez-Calvet, M; Khachaturian, AS; Mielke, MM; Udeh-Momoh, C; Weiss, J; Batrla, R; Bozeat, S; Dwyer, JR; Holzapfel, D; Jones, DR; Murray, JF; Partrick, KA; Scholler, E; Vradenburg, G; Young, D; Algeciras-Schimnich, A; Aubrecht, J; Braunstein, JB; Hendrix, J; Hu, YH; Mattke, S; Monane, M; Reilly, D; Somers, E; Teunissen, CE; Shobin, E; Vanderstichele, H; Weiner, MW; Wilson, D; Hansson, O"

Emergence of the brain-border immune niches and their contribution to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.,"Historically, the central nervous system (CNS) was regarded as 'immune-privileged', possessing its own distinct immune cell population. This immune privilege was thought to be established by a tight blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier (BCSFB), which prevented the crossing of peripheral immune cells and their secreted factors into the CNS parenchyma. However, recent studies have revealed the presence of peripheral immune cells in proximity to various brain-border niches such as the choroid plexus, cranial bone marrow (CBM), meninges, and perivascular spaces. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that peripheral immune cells may be able to infiltrate the brain through these sites and play significant roles in driving neuronal cell death and pathology progression in neurodegenerative disease. Thus, in this review, we explore how the brain-border immune niches may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). We then discuss several emerging options for harnessing the neuroimmune potential of these niches to improve the prognosis and treatment of these debilitative disorders using novel insights from recent studies.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; brain-border; multiple sclerosis; neurodegeneration; neuroimmune,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Immune Privilege,"Tan, LY; Cunliffe, G; Hogan, MP; Yeo, XY; Oh, C; Jin, B; Kang, J; Park, J; Kwon, MS; Kim, M; Jung, S"
"The PREVENT dementia programme: baseline demographic, lifestyle, imaging and cognitive data from a midlife cohort study investigating risk factors for dementia.","PREVENT is a multi-centre prospective cohort study in the UK and Ireland that aims to examine midlife risk factors for dementia and identify and describe the earliest indices of disease development. The PREVENT dementia programme is one of the original epidemiological initiatives targeting midlife as a critical window for intervention in neurodegenerative conditions. This paper provides an overview of the study protocol and presents the first summary results from the initial baseline data to describe the cohort. Participants in the PREVENT cohort provide demographic data, biological samples (blood, saliva, urine and optional cerebrospinal fluid), lifestyle and psychological questionnaires, undergo a comprehensive cognitive test battery and are imaged using multi-modal 3-T MRI scanning, with both structural and functional sequences. The PREVENT cohort governance structure is described, which includes a steering committee, a scientific advisory board and core patient and public involvement groups. A number of sub-studies that supplement the main PREVENT cohort are also described. The PREVENT cohort baseline data include 700 participants recruited between 2014 and 2020 across five sites in the UK and Ireland (Cambridge, Dublin, Edinburgh, London and Oxford).

Alzheimer disease blood biomarkers: considerations for population-level use.,"In the past 5 years, we have witnessed the first approved Alzheimer disease (AD) disease-modifying therapy and the development of blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) to aid the diagnosis of AD. For many reasons, including accessibility, invasiveness and cost, BBMs are more acceptable and feasible for patients than a lumbar puncture (for cerebrospinal fluid collection) or neuroimaging. However, many questions remain regarding how best to utilize BBMs at the population level. In this Review, we outline the factors that warrant consideration for the widespread implementation and interpretation of AD BBMs. To set the scene, we review the current use of biomarkers, including BBMs, in AD. We go on to describe the characteristics of typical patients with cognitive impairment in primary care, who often differ from the patient populations used in AD BBM research studies. We also consider factors that might affect the interpretation of BBM tests, such as comorbidities, sex and race or ethnicity. We conclude by discussing broader issues such as ethics, patient and provider preference, incidental findings and dealing with indeterminate results and imperfect accuracy in implementing BBMs at the population level.",2024,,,"Mielke, MM; Fowler, NR"

We report an accurate 3-biological compartment model able to simultaneously account for the protein dynamics observed in blood plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) including a hidden central nervous system (CNS) compartment. We successfully applied this model to 69 proteins of a single individual displaying similar or very different dynamics in plasma and CSF.

"Associations of CSF BACE1 with amyloid pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognition in Alzheimer's disease.","Β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme (BACE1) is a crucial protease in the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the side effects observed in clinical trials of BACE1 inhibitors, including reduction in brain volume and cognitive worsening, suggest that the exact role of BACE1 in AD pathology is not fully understood. To further investigate this, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of BACE1 and its cleaved product sAPPβ that reflects BACE1 activity in the China Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorder Initiative cohort. We found significant correlations between CSF BACE1 or sAPPβ levels and CSF Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, but not with amyloid deposition detected by 18F-Florbetapir PET. Additionally, CSF BACE1 and sAPPβ levels were positively associated with cortical thickness in multiple brain regions, and higher levels of sAPPβ were linked to increased cortical glucose metabolism in frontal and supramarginal areas. Interestingly, individuals with higher baseline levels of CSF BACE1 exhibited slower rates of brain volume reduction and cognitive worsening over time. This suggests that increased levels and activity of BACE1 may not be the determining factor for amyloid deposition, but instead, may be associated with increased neuronal activity and potentially providing protection against neurodegeneration in AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; BACE1; Neurodegeneration; PET imaging,"Humans; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Aged; Female; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Positron-Emission Tomography; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Cognition; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments","Gao, F; Zhang, M; Wang, Q; Ni, M; Liu, C; Deng, K; Xie, Q; Wang, S; Shi, J; Shen, Y"

Cerebrospinal fluid efflux through dynamic paracellular pores on venules as a missing piece of the brain drainage system.,"The glymphatic system plays a key role in the clearance of waste from the parenchyma, and its dysfunction has been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, questions remain regarding its complete mechanisms. Here, we report that efflux of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/interstitial fluid (ISF) solutes occurs through a triphasic process that cannot be explained by the current model, but rather hints at the possibility of other, previously undiscovered routes from paravenous spaces to the blood. Using real-time, in vivo observation of efflux, a novel drainage pathway was discovered, in which CSF molecules enter the bloodstream directly through dynamically assembled, trumpet-shaped pores (basolateral ",2024,Aβ clearance; brain drainage pathway; dynamic asymmetric pores; perivascular space dilation; tight junctions,,"Dong, Y; Xu, T; Yuan, L; Wang, Y; Yu, S; Wang, Z; Chen, S; Chen, C; He, W; Stewart, T; Zhang, W; Yang, X"
Data Independent Acquisition to Inform the Development of Targeted Proteomics Assays Using a Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer.,"Mass spectrometry based targeted proteomics methods provide sensitive and high-throughput analysis of selected proteins. To develop a targeted bottom-up proteomics assay, peptides must be evaluated as proxies for the measurement of a protein or proteoform in a biological matrix. Candidate peptide selection typically relies on predetermined biochemical properties, data from semi-stochastic sampling, or by empirical measurements. These strategies require extensive testing and method refinement due to the difficulties associated with prediction of peptide response in the biological matrix of interest. Gas-phase fractionated (GPF) narrow window data-independent acquisition (DIA) aids in the development of reproducible selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays by providing matrix-specific information on peptide detectability and quantification by mass spectrometry. To demonstrate the suitability of DIA data for selecting peptide targets, we reimplement a portion of an existing assay to measure 98 Alzheimer's disease proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Peptides were selected from GPF-DIA based on signal intensity and reproducibility. The resulting SRM assay exhibits similar quantitative precision to published data, despite the inclusion of different peptides between the assays. This workflow enables development of new assays without additional up-front data acquisition, demonstrated here through generation of a separate assay for an unrelated set of proteins in CSF from the same dataset.",2024,,,"Plubell, DL; Huang, E; Spencer, SE; Poston, K; Montine, TJ; MacCoss, MJ"

Association of soluble TREM2 with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) is a potential neuroinflammatory biomarker linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

"Cognitive profile, neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.","We aimed to characterize the cognitive profile of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) patients with cognitive complaints, exploring the influence of biological and psychological factors. Participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and cognitive complaints ≥ 8 weeks post-acute phase were included. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery (NPS) and health questionnaires were administered at inclusion and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Blood samples were collected at each visit, MRI scan at baseline and at 6 months, and, optionally, cerebrospinal fluid. Cognitive features were analyzed in relation to clinical, neuroimaging, and biochemical markers at inclusion and follow-up. Forty-nine participants, with a mean time from symptom onset of 10.4 months, showed attention-executive function (69%) and verbal memory (39%) impairment. Apathy (64%), moderate-severe anxiety (57%), and severe fatigue (35%) were prevalent. Visual memory (8%) correlated with total gray matter (GM) and subcortical GM volume. Neuronal damage and inflammation markers were within normal limits. Over time, cognitive test scores, depression, apathy, anxiety scores, MRI indexes, and fluid biomarkers remained stable, although fewer participants (50% vs. 75.5%; p = 0.012) exhibited abnormal cognitive evaluations at follow-up.

Age-adjusted CSF t-tau and NfL do not improve diagnostic accuracy for prodromal Alzheimer's disease.,"Cerebrospinal fluid total-tau (t-tau) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are biomarkers of neurodegeneration and are increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to adjust for age-related increases in t-tau and NfL, cross-sectional age-adjusted norms were developed based on amyloid negative cognitively normal (CN) adults aged 41-78 years (CN, n = 137). The age-adjusted norms for t-tau and NfL did not improve receiver operating curve based diagnostic accuracies in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (AD-MCI, n = 144). Furthermore, while NfL was correlated with higher age in AD-MCI, no significant correlation was found for t-tau. The cox proportional hazard models, applied in 429 participants with baseline t-tau and NfL, showed higher hazard ratio of progression to MCI or dementia without age-adjustments (HR = 3.39 for t-tau and HR = 3.17 for NfL), as compared to using our norms (HR = 2.29 for t-tau and HR = 1.89 for NfL). Our results indicate that utilizing normative reference data could obscure significant age-related increases in these markers associated with neurodegeneration and AD leading to a potential loss of overall diagnostic accuracy.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; aging; neurofilament light chain; normative reference data; total-tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Neurofilament Proteins; Male; Aged; Female; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Adult; Disease Progression; Proportional Hazards Models; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aging; Prodromal Symptoms,"Knudtzon, SL; Nordengen, K; Grøntvedt, GR; Jarholm, J; Eliassen, IV; Selnes, P; Pålhaugen, L; Espenes, J; Gísladóttir, B; Waterloo, K; Fladby, T; Kirsebom, BE"

Distinctive contribution of two additional residues in protein aggregation of Aβ42 and Aβ40 isoforms.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that self-assemble to protein aggregates, incurring cell malfunction and cytotoxicity. While Aβ has been known to regulate multiple physiological functions, such as enhancing synaptic functions, aiding in the recovery of the blood-brain barrier/brain injury, and exhibiting tumor suppression/antimicrobial activities, the hydrophobicity of the primary structure promotes pathological aggregations that are closely associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ proteins consist of multiple isoforms with 37-43 amino acid residues that are produced by the cleavage of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP). The hydrolytic products of APP are secreted to the extracellular regions of neuronal cells. Aβ 1-42 (Aβ42) and Aβ 1-40 (Aβ40) are dominant isoforms whose significance in AD pathogenesis has been highlighted in numerous studies to understand the molecular mechanism and develop AD diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we focus on the differences between Aβ42 and Aβ40 in the molecular mechanism of amyloid aggregations mediated by the two additional residues (Ile41 and Ala42) of Aβ42. The current comprehension of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in AD progression is outlined, together with the structural features of Aβ42/Aβ40 amyloid fibrils, and the aggregation mechanisms of Aβ42/Aβ40. Furthermore, the impact of the heterogeneous distribution of Aβ isoforms during amyloid aggregations is discussed in the system mimicking the coexistence of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma.

Alteration of gene expression and protein solubility of the PI 5-phosphatase SHIP2 are correlated with Alzheimer's disease pathology progression.,"A recent large genome-wide association study has identified EGFR (encoding the epidermal growth factor EGFR) as a new genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. SHIP2, encoded by INPPL1, is taking part in the signalling and interactome of several growth factor receptors, such as the EGFR. While INPPL1 has been identified as one of the most significant genes whose RNA expression correlates with cognitive decline, the potential alteration of SHIP2 expression and localization during the progression of AD remains largely unknown. Here we report that gene expression of both EGFR and INPPL1 was upregulated in AD brains. SHIP2 immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in plaque-associated astrocytes and dystrophic neurites and its increase was correlated with amyloid load in the brain of human AD and of 5xFAD transgenic mouse model of AD. While mRNA of INPPL1 was increased in AD, SHIP2 protein undergoes a significant solubility change being depleted from the soluble fraction of AD brain homogenates and co-enriched with EGFR in the insoluble fraction. Using FRET-based flow cytometry biosensor assay for tau-tau interaction, overexpression of SHIP2 significantly increased the FRET signal while siRNA-mediated downexpression of SHIP2 significantly decreased FRET signal. Genetic association analyses suggest that some variants in INPPL1 locus are associated with the level of CSF pTau. Our data support the hypothesis that SHIP2 is an intermediate key player of EGFR and AD pathology linking amyloid and tau pathologies in human AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid ß; CSP pTau; EGFR; GWAS; INPPL1; SHIP2; Tau,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Female; Humans; Male; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Disease Progression; ErbB Receptors; Gene Expression; Mice, Transgenic; Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases; Solubility; tau Proteins","Ando, K; Küçükali, F; Doeraene, E; Nagaraj, S; Antonelli, EM; Thazin Htut, M; Yilmaz, Z; Kosa, AC; Lopez-Guitierrez, L; Quintanilla-Sánchez, C; Aydin, E; Ramos, AR; Mansour, S; Turbant, S; Schurmans, S; Sleegers, K; Erneux, C; Brion, JP; Leroy, K"
"Neuromodulatory subcortical nucleus integrity is associated with white matter microstructure, tauopathy and APOE status.","The neuromodulatory subcortical nuclei within the isodendritic core (IdC) are the earliest sites of tauopathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We investigated the relationship between IdC microstructure and whole-brain white matter microstructure to better understand early neuropathological changes in AD. Using multiparametric quantitative magnetic resonance imaging we observed two covariance patterns between IdC and white matter microstructure in 133 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age 67.9 ± 5.3 years) with familial risk for AD. IdC integrity related to 1) whole-brain neurite density, and 2) neurite orientation dispersion in white matter tracts known to be affected early in AD. Pattern 2 was associated with CSF concentration of phosphorylated-tau, indicating AD specificity. Apolipoprotein-E4 carriers expressed both patterns more strongly than non-carriers.

Alzheimer-Type Cerebral Amyloidosis in the Context of HIV Infection: Implications for a Proposed New Treatment Approach.,"Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) are currently broadly prescribed for the treatment of HIV infection but are also thought to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression by protecting against amyloidosis. Our study evaluates the hypothesis that reverse transcriptase inhibitors protect against Alzheimer-type brain amyloidogenesis in the context of HIV infection. We compiled a case series of participants from a prospective study of the neurological consequences of HIV infection at the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP) who had serial neuropsychological and neurological assessments and were on RTIs. Two participants had gross and microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry of the brain at autopsy; one was assessed clinically for Alzheimer's disease by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis of phosphorylated-Tau, Total-Tau and Aβ42. Additionally, a larger cohort of 250 autopsied individuals was evaluated for presence of amyloid plaques, Tau, and related pathologies. Three older, virally suppressed individuals with HIV who had long-term treatment with RTIs were included in analyses. Two cases demonstrated substantial cerebral amyloid deposition at autopsy. The third case met clinical criteria for AD based on a typical clinical course and CSF biomarker profile. In the larger cohort of autopsied individuals, the prevalence of cerebral amyloidosis among people with HIV (PWH) was greater for those on RTIs. Our study showed that long-term RTI therapy did not protect against Alzheimer-type brain amyloidogenesis in the context of HIV infection in these patients. Given the known toxicities of RTIs, it is premature to recommend them to individuals at risk or with Alzheimer's disease who do not have HIV infection.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid; Cerebral amyloidosis; HIV; Reverse transcriptase inhibitors,Humans; HIV Infections; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Amyloidosis; Aged; Prospective Studies; tau Proteins; Brain; Cohort Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Ellis, RJ; Pal, S; Achim, CL; Sundermann, E; Moore, DJ; Soontornniyomkij, V; Feldman, H"

However, little is known about the impact of brain tumors on glymphatic function. Mechanical forces generated during tumor development and growth may be responsible for compromised glymphatic transport pathways, reducing waste clearance and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport in the brain parenchyma. One such force is solid stress, i.e., growth-induced forces from cell hyperproliferation and excess matrix deposition.

Astrocytic-derived vascular remodeling factors are independently associated with blood brain barrier permeability in Alzheimer's disease.,"Astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) exert a pivotal role in the maintenance of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity essentially through structural support and release of soluble factors. This study provides new insights into the vascular remodeling processes occurring in AD, and reveals, in vivo, a pathological profile of astrocytic secretion involving Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, MMP-2 and Endothelin-1 (ET-1). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of VEGF, MMP-2/-9 were lower in patients belonging to the AD continuum, compared to aged-matched controls. CSF levels of VEGF and ET-1 positively correlated with MMP-9 but negatively with MMP-2, suggesting a complex vascular remodeling process occurring in AD. Only MMP-2 levels were significantly associated with CSF AD biomarkers. Conversely, higher MMP-2 (β = 0.411, p < 0.001), ET-1 levels (β = 0.344, p < 0.001) and VEGF (β = 0.221, p = 0.022), were associated with higher BBB permeability.

Towards cascading genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease typically progresses in stages, which have been defined by the presence of disease-specific biomarkers: Amyloid (A), Tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N). This progression of biomarkers has been condensed into the ATN framework, where each of the biomarkers can be either positive (+) or negative (-). Over the past decades genome wide association studies have implicated about 90 different loci involved with the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease. Here we investigate whether genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease contributes equally to the progression in different disease stages or whether it exhibits a stage-dependent effect. Amyloid (A) and tau (T) status was defined using a combination of available PET and CSF biomarkers in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. In 312 participants with biomarker-confirmed A-T- status, we employed Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the contribution of APOE and polygenic risk scores (beyond APOE) to convert to A+T- status (65 conversions). Furthermore, we repeated the analysis in 290 participants with A+T- status and investigated the genetic contribution to conversion to A+T+ (45 conversions). Both survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education. For progression from A-T- to A+T-, APOE-e4 burden showed significant effect (HR=2.88; 95% CI: 1.70-4.89; P<0.001), while polygenic risk did not (HR=1.09; 95% CI: 0.84-1.42; P=0.53). Conversely, for the transition from A+T- to A+T+, the APOE-e4 burden contribution was reduced (HR=1.62 95% CI: 1.05-2.51; P=0.031), while the polygenic risk showed an increased contribution (HR=1.73; 95% CI:1.27-2.36; P<0.001). The marginal APOE effect was driven by e4 homozygotes (HR=2.58; 95% CI: 1.05-6.35; P=0.039) as opposed to e4 heterozygotes (HR=1.74; 95% CI: 0.87-3.49; P=0.12). The genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease unfolds in a disease stage-dependent fashion. A better understanding of the interplay between disease stage and genetic risk can lead to a more mechanistic understanding of transition between ATN stages, a better understanding of the molecular processes leading to Alzheimer's disease as well as opening therapeutic windows for targeted interventions.",2024,APOE; Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; longitudinal progression; polygenic risk,,"Altmann, A; Aksman, LM; Oxtoby, NP; Young, A; Alexander, DC; Barkhof, F; Shoai, M; Hardy, J; Schott, JM"
Daphnetin protects neurons in an Alzheimer disease mouse model and normal rat neurons by inhibiting BACE1 activity and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.,"The common neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by memory dysfunction and cognitive decline in the elderly. Neuropathological features include aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the brain. Daphnetin (DAPH), a natural coumarin derivative, has the potential for inhibiting inflammatory and oxidative responses. We explored neuroprotective roles of DAPH treatment in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse AD model. DAPH ameliorated spatial learning disabilities in Morris water maze tests and reduced Aβ deposition, assessed by immunohistochemistry. It also reduced the Aβ content in supernatants of neurons from fetal APP/PS1 mice, assessed by cell-based soluble ELISA. Molecular docking and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay results suggested that DAPH could directly inhibit BACE1 activity. Furthermore, in vitro experiments utilizing isolated rat neurons assessing RNA expression profiling, immunofluorescence, TUNEL assay, and Western-blot analysis, suggested the potential of DAPH for regulating BDNF and GM-CSF expression and mitigating Aβ1-42-induced cortical injury, synaptic loss, and apoptosis. HO-1 and Nrf2 mRNA and protein expression were also increased in a dose-dependent manner. These results underscore the potential of DAPH as a neuroprotective agent in reversing memory deficits associated with AD and bolster its candidacy as a multitarget natural small-molecule drug for AD patients.",2024,Alzheimer disease (AD); Daphnetin (DAPH); Neuron; Nrf2/HO-1 pathway; β-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1); β-amyloid (Aβ),,"Zhang, X; Ma, W; Liu, H; Liu, Y; Zhang, Y; He, S; Ding, X; Li, B; Yan, Y"
[Blood biomarkers open a window to brain pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease].,"Technical developments have paved the way for the development of ultrasensitive analytical methods that allow for precise quantification of brain-specific proteins in blood samples. Plasma levels of amyloid β, specifically the Aβ42/40 ratio, are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and show concordance with brain amyloidosis assessed by PET, but the overlap with normal elderly may be too large for reliable use in clinical applications. Plasma phosphorylated tau (P-tau), especially a variant called P-tau217, is markedly increased in the early symptomatic stages of AD but remains normal in other neurodegenerative disorders. Total tau (T-tau) is measurable in blood and shows most promise as a biomarker for acute neuronal injury (e.g. acute traumatic or hypoxic brain injury), where T-tau shows a fast and dramatic increase but does not work well as an AD biomarker due to contributions to blood levels from peripheral tissues. Instead, a novel method for tau protein produced only in the CNS called brain-derived tau (BD-tau) shows promise as a biomarker for AD-type neurodegeneration. Neurofilament light (NFL) levels in blood correlate tightly with levels in CSF and reflect axonal injury irrespective of the underlying cause. Increased blood NFL concentration is found in several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, but even more so in disorders such as motor neuron disease and frontotemporal dementia. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed with activation of astrocytes, and is mildly increased in AD, but is also very high also in acute brain disorders. These blood tests show promise as tools to identify AD pathophysiology in the first assessment of patients with early cognitive symptoms, also in primary care, to guide clinical management and possible admission to the specialist clinic. A two-step model will result in a very high accuracy to either predict or exclude brain amyloidosis of the Alzheimer type.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Neurofilament Proteins; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,"Blennow, K; Hansson, O"

Predictive value for cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease profile of different measures of verbal episodic memory in patients with MCI.,"Neuropsychological evidence of memory impairment represents the main feature of the clinical onset of typical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Logical Memory (LM) are two tests both assessing verbal episodic memory, widely used in clinical practice. Our aim was to investigate the added value of their combined use in predicting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers positivity in a retrospective consecutive series of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 169 MCI patients were included. For all of them neuropsychological assessment and CSF analysis were available. According to CSF A/T/(N) profile, 109 were defined as MCI due to AD (A+T+), and 60 were non-AD MCI (A-T-). Logistic regression model and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed to evaluate the discriminatory power of single and combined sub-measures between AD and non-AD patients. The combination of RAVLT-del with LM could acceptably discriminate the two groups (AUC: 0.69, CI 95% 0.617-0.761, sens: 0.75, spec. 0.58, p < 0.001), while the single tests did not show sufficient discriminative performance. Our study shows that the combination of RAVLT delayed recall with LM better predicts the biological AD diagnosis (A+T+), showing a good discriminative power between MCI-AD from non-AD MCI. Since RAVLT and LM assess different components of verbal episodic memory, they should be considered as complementary, rather than interchangeable, tests.",2024,A/T/(N) classification; Alzheimer’s disease; CSF biomarkers; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Verbal episodic memory,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Memory, Episodic; Male; Female; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Neuropsychological Tests; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; ROC Curve; Verbal Learning; Predictive Value of Tests; Aged, 80 and over","Salvadori, N; Torrigiani, EG; Paoletti, FP; Chipi, E; Montanucci, C; Verderosa, C; Siena, E; Fruttini, D; Parnetti, L"

Controlled exercise intervention studies published in the English language were selected if they assessed the effects of a physical exercise intervention of at least 2 weeks in middle-aged or older adults on one of the following biomarkers measured either in the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid or the blood: beta-amyloid, tau, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Overall, there was no strong evidence of significant effects of exercise interventions on any of the selected biomarkers. However, in specific populations, such as women with obesity, pre-diabetes, or depression, favorable changes in blood beta-amyloid concentrations were reported. Further benefits on cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid were also demonstrated in ",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; biomarkers; physical exercise; tau,,"Raffin, J"
The circadian clock in the choroid plexus drives rhythms in multiple cellular processes under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.,"Choroid plexus (ChP), the brain structure primarily responsible for cerebrospinal fluid production, contains a robust circadian clock, whose role remains to be elucidated. The aim of our study was to [1] identify rhythmically controlled cellular processes in the mouse ChP and [2] assess the role and nature of signals derived from the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) that control ChP rhythms.

Is CAA a perivascular brain clearance disease? A discussion of the evidence to date and outlook for future studies.,"The brain's network of perivascular channels for clearance of excess fluids and waste plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is the main cause of hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly, the most common vascular comorbidity in Alzheimer's disease and also implicated in adverse events related to anti-amyloid immunotherapy. Remarkably, the mechanisms governing perivascular clearance of soluble amyloid β-a key culprit in CAA-from the brain to draining lymphatics and systemic circulation remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is critically important to bridge for understanding the pathophysiology of CAA and accelerate development of targeted therapeutics. The authors of this review recently converged their diverse expertise in the field of perivascular physiology to specifically address this problem within the framework of a Leducq Foundation Transatlantic Network of Excellence on Brain Clearance. This review discusses the overarching goal of the consortium and explores the evidence supporting or refuting the role of impaired perivascular clearance in the pathophysiology of CAA with a focus on translating observations from rodents to humans. We also discuss the anatomical features of perivascular channels as well as the biophysical characteristics of fluid and solute transport.",2024,Brain clearance; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Cerebrospinal fluid; Glymphatics; IPAD; Perivascular spaces,Humans; Brain; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Glymphatic System; Alzheimer Disease,"van Veluw, SJ; Benveniste, H; Bakker, ENTP; Carare, RO; Greenberg, SM; Iliff, JJ; Lorthois, S; Van Nostrand, WE; Petzold, GC; Shih, AY; van Osch, MJP"

Towards Early Diagnosis and Screening of Alzheimer's Disease Using Frequency Locked Whispering Gallery Mode Microtoroid Biosensors.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive form of dementia affecting almost 55 million people worldwide. It is characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles within the brain, leading to a pathological cascade of neuron degeneration and death as well as memory loss and cognitive decline. Amyloid beta (Aβ) is an AD biomarker present in cerebrospinal fluid and blood serum and correlates with the presence of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain. Measuring the levels of Aβ can help with early diagnosis of AD, which is key for studying novel AD drugs and delaying the symptoms of dementia. However, this goal is difficult to achieve due to the low levels of AD biomarkers in biofluids. Here we demonstrate for the first time the use of FLOWER (frequency locked optical whispering evanescent resonator) for quantifying the levels of post-mortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 in clinicopathologically classified control, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants. FLOWER is capable of measuring CSF Aβ42 (area under curve, AUC = 0.92) with higher diagnostic performance than standard ELISA (AUC = 0.82) and was also able to distinguish between control and MCI samples. Our results demonstrate the capability of FLOWER for screening CSF samples for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's pathology.",2024,,,"Gin, A; Nguyen, PD; Serrano, G; Alexander, G; Su, J"

Evidence for reduced anti-inflammatory microglial phagocytic response in late-life major depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the precise mechanisms underlying this relationship are not understood. While it is well established that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) increase during early stages of AD, how sTREM2 levels behave in subjects with MDD is not known. In a longitudinal study, we measured CSF sTREM2 levels in 27 elderly cognitively intact individuals with late-life major depression (LLMD) and in 19 healthy controls. We tested the hypothesis that, similarly to what happens in early stages of AD, CSF sTREM2 would be elevated in MDD. In addition, we compared the associations of CSF sTREM2, pro- and anti- inflammatory, and AD biomarkers in LLMD and control subjects. Surprisingly, we found that mean CSF sTREM2 levels were significantly reduced in LLMD compared to controls. This reduction was no longer significant at the 3-year follow-up visit when depression severity improved. In addition, we found that CSF sTREM2 was associated with AD biomarkers and proinflammatory cytokines in controls but not in LLMD. These findings suggest that impaired microglia phagocytic response to AD pathology may be a novel link between MDD and AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta; Depression; Microglia; Phagocytosis; sTREM2,,"Reichert Plaska, C; Heslegrave, A; Bruno, D; Ramos-Cejudo, J; Han Lee, S; Osorio, R; Imbimbo, BP; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Pomara, N"

Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Guidance on Dementia: The Investigation of Suspected Dementia (SIGN 168) with Focus on Biomarkers-Executive Summary.,"This is an executive summary of the recent guidance produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) dementia guideline group with regards to the investigation of suspected dementia. This is a sub-section of the broader SIGN 168 guideline released in November 2023. The guideline group included clinicians with expertise in Old Age Psychiatry, Neurology, Radiology, and Nuclear Medicine supported by colleagues from the SIGN and Healthcare Improvement Scotland teams. There was representation from carers and support organizations with experience of dementia, to ensure the recommendations were appropriate from the perspective of the people being assessed for possible dementia and their carers. As the 2018 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) dementia review included a review of the evidenced investigation of dementia, the SIGN guideline development group decided to focus on a review on the up-to-date evidence regarding the role of imaging and fluid biomarkers in the diagnosis of dementia. To give context to the consideration of more advanced diagnostic biomarker investigations, the guideline and this summary include the NICE guidance on the use of standard investigations as well as more specialist investigations. The evidence review supports consideration of the use of structural imaging, nuclear medicine imaging, and established Alzheimer's cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid and tau) in the diagnosis of dementia. Although routine use of amyloid positron emission tomography imaging was not recommended, its potential use, under specialist direction, in patients with atypical or young-onset presentations of suspected Alzheimer's dementia was included as a clinical good practice point.",2024,,,"Mackay, GA; Gall, C; Jampana, R; Sleith, C; Lip, GYH"

"Comparative Analysis of Posiphen Pharmacokinetics across Different Species-Similar Absorption and Metabolism in Mouse, Rat, Dog and Human.","Posiphen is a small molecule that exhibits neuroprotective properties by targeting multiple neurotoxic proteins involved in axonal transport, synaptic transmission, neuroinflammation, and cell death. Its broad-spectrum effects make it a promising candidate for treating neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Despite extensive investigation with animal models and human subjects, a comprehensive comparative analysis of Posiphen's pharmacokinetics across studies remains elusive. Here, we address this gap by examining the metabolic profiles of Posiphen and its breakdown into two primary metabolites-N1 and N8-across species by measuring their concentrations in plasma, brain, and CSF using the LC-MS/MS method. While all three compounds effectively inhibit neurotoxic proteins, the N1 metabolite is associated with adverse effects. Our findings reveal the species-specific behavior of Posiphen, with both Posiphen and N8 being predominant in various species, while N1 remains a minor constituent, supporting the drug's safety. Moreover, in plasma, Posiphen consistently showed fast clearance of all metabolites within 8 h in animal models and in human subjects, whereas in CSF or brain, the compound has an extended half-life of over 12 h. Combining all our human data and analyzing them by population pharmacokinetics showed that there are no differences between healthy volunteers, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's patients. It also showed that Posiphen is absorbed and metabolized in a similar fashion across all animal species and human groups tested. These observations have critical implications for understanding the drug's safety, therapeutic effect, and clinical translation.",2024,metabolism; neurodegeneration; neurodegenerative diseases; pharmacokinetics; posiphen; species comparison,"Humans; Animals; Rats; Dogs; Mice; Male; Species Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Brain; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Neuroprotective Agents; Female","Maccecchini, ML; Mould, DR"

Investigating the brain's neurochemical profile at midlife in relation to dementia risk factors.,"Changes in the brain's physiology in Alzheimer's disease are thought to occur early in the disease's trajectory. In this study our aim was to investigate the brain's neurochemical profile in a midlife cohort in relation to risk factors for future dementia using single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Participants in the multi-site PREVENT-Dementia study (age range 40-59 year old) underwent 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy with the spectroscopy voxel placed in the posterior cingulate/precuneus region. Using LCModel, we quantified the absolute concentrations of myo-inositol, total N-acetylaspartate, total creatine, choline, glutathione and glutamate-glutamine for 406 participants (mean age 51.1; 65.3% female). Underlying partial volume effects were accounted for by applying a correction for the presence of cerebrospinal fluid in the magnetic resonance spectroscopy voxel. We investigated how metabolite concentrations related to apolipoprotein ɛ4 genotype, dementia family history, a risk score (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Incidence of Dementia -CAIDE) for future dementia including non-modifiable and potentially-modifiable factors and dietary patterns (adherence to Mediterranean diet). Dementia family history was associated with decreased total N-acetylaspartate and no differences were found between apolipoprotein ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers. A higher Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia score related to higher myo-inositol, choline, total creatine and glutamate-glutamine, an effect which was mainly driven by older age and a higher body mass index. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower choline, myo-inositol and total creatine; these effects did not survive correction for multiple comparisons.

Considerations for biomarker strategies in clinical trials investigating tau-targeting therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.,"The use of biomarker-led clinical trial designs has been transformative for investigating amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The designs have ensured the correct selection of patients on these trials, supported target engagement and have been used to support claims of disease modification and clinical efficacy. Ultimately, this has recently led to approval of disease-modifying, amyloid-targeting therapies for AD; something that should be noted for clinical trials investigating tau-targeting therapies for AD. There is a clear overlap of the purpose of biomarker use at each stage of clinical development between amyloid-targeting and tau-targeting clinical trials. However, there are differences within the potential context of use and interpretation for some biomarkers in particular measurements of amyloid and utility of soluble, phosphorylated tau biomarkers. Given the complexities of tau in health and disease, it is paramount that therapies target disease-relevant tau and, in parallel, appropriate assays of target engagement are developed. Tau positron emission tomography, fluid biomarkers reflecting tau pathology and downstream measures of neurodegeneration will be important both for participant recruitment and for monitoring disease-modification in tau-targeting clinical trials.

Progress on early diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects both cognition and non-cognition functions. The disease follows a continuum, starting with preclinical stages, progressing to mild cognitive and behavioral impairment, ultimately leading to dementia. Early detection of AD is crucial for better diagnosis and more effective treatment. However, the current AD diagnostic tests of biomarkers using cerebrospinal fluid and/or brain imaging are invasive or expensive, and mostly are still not able to detect early disease state. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic techniques with higher sensitivity and specificity during the preclinical stages of AD. Various non-cognitive manifestations, including behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbances, sensory dysfunctions, and physical changes, have been observed in the preclinical AD stage before occurrence of notable cognitive decline. Recent research advances have identified several biofluid biomarkers as early indicators of AD. This review focuses on these non-cognitive changes and newly discovered biomarkers in AD, specifically addressing the preclinical stages of the disease. Furthermore, it is of importance to explore the potential for developing a predictive system or network to forecast disease onset and progression at the early stage of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; early diagnosis; non-cognitive symptoms,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Biomarkers; Early Diagnosis; Disease Progression; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain,"Chen, Y; Al-Nusaif, M; Li, S; Tan, X; Yang, H; Cai, H; Le, W"

PTPRS is a novel marker for early tau pathology and synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease.,"We examined the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTPRS) in the context of Alzheimer's disease and synaptic integrity. Publicly available datasets (BRAINEAC, ROSMAP, ADC1) and a cohort of asymptomatic but ""at risk"" individuals (PREVENT-AD) were used to explore the relationship between PTPRS and various Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. We identified that PTPRS rs10415488 variant C shows features of neuroprotection against early tau pathology and synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This single nucleotide polymorphism correlated with higher PTPRS transcript abundance and lower P-tau181 and GAP-43 levels in the CSF. In the brain, PTPRS protein abundance was significantly correlated with the quantity of two markers of synaptic integrity: SNAP25 and SYT-1. We also found the presence of sexual dimorphism for PTPRS, with higher CSF concentrations in males than females. Male carriers for variant C were found to have a 10-month delay in the onset of AD. We thus conclude that PTPRS acts as a neuroprotective receptor in Alzheimer's disease.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio associates with markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology in cognitively unimpaired elderly people.,"An elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in blood has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an elevated NLR has also been implicated in many other conditions that are risk factors for AD, prompting investigation into whether the NLR is directly linked with AD pathology or a result of underlying comorbidities. Herein, we explored the relationship between the NLR and AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Adjusting for sociodemographics, APOE4, and common comorbidities, we investigated these associations in two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the M.J. de Leon CSF repository at NYU.

Future perspective and clinical applicability of the combined use of plasma phosphorylated tau 181 and neurofilament light chain in Subjective Cognitive Decline and Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"We aimed to assess diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau181 and NfL separately and in combination in discriminating Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients carrying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology from non-carriers; to propose a flowchart for the interpretation of the results of plasma p-tau181 and NfL. We included 43 SCD, 41 MCI and 21 AD-demented (AD-d) patients, who underwent plasma p-tau181 and NfL analysis. Twenty-eight SCD, 41 MCI and 21 AD-d patients underwent CSF biomarkers analysis (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-42/1-40, p-tau, t-tau) and were classified as carriers of AD pathology (AP+) it they were A+/T+ , or non-carriers (AP-) when they were A-, A+/T-/N-, or A+/T-/N+ according to the A/T(N) system. Plasma p-tau181 and NfL separately showed a good accuracy (AUC = 0.88), while the combined model (NfL + p-tau181) showed an excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.92) in discriminating AP+ from AP- patients. Plasma p-tau181 and NfL results were moderately concordant (Coehn's k = 0.50, p < 0.001). Based on a logistic regression model, we estimated the risk of AD pathology considering the two biomarkers: 10.91% if both p-tau181 and NfL were negative; 41.10 and 76.49% if only one biomarker was positive (respectively p-tau18 and NfL); 94.88% if both p-tau181 and NfL were positive.

Climate change and disorders of the nervous system.,"Anthropogenic climate change is affecting people's health, including those with neurological and psychiatric diseases. Currently, making inferences about the effect of climate change on neurological and psychiatric diseases is challenging because of an overall sparsity of data, differing study methods, paucity of detail regarding disease subtypes, little consideration of the effect of individual and population genetics, and widely differing geographical locations with the potential for regional influences. However, evidence suggests that the incidence, prevalence, and severity of many nervous system conditions (eg, stroke, neurological infections, and some mental health disorders) can be affected by climate change. The data show broad and complex adverse effects, especially of temperature extremes to which people are unaccustomed and wide diurnal temperature fluctuations. Protective measures might be possible through local forecasting. Few studies project the future effects of climate change on brain health, hindering policy developments.

Circulating Cell Free DNA and DNA Double-Strand Breakage in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. AD is pathologically characterized by age-dependent accumulation of amyloid-β protein and the phosphorylation of tau protein in the brains of patients with AD. Clinically, manifestations of AD include cognitive decline, dementia, alterations of high-order brain functions, and movement disorders. Double-stranded DNA breaks are a lethal form of DNA damage and are typically repaired via non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. However, in AD brain, repair mechanism is disrupted, leading to a cascade of events, cognitive dysfunction, organ failure and reduced lifespan. Increased circulating cell-free DNA in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine in patients with AD, can be used as early detectable biomarkers for AD. The purpose of our article is to explore the potential uses of cell-free DNA and double-stranded DNA breaks as prognostic markers for AD and examine the recent research on the application of these markers in studies.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; cell-free DNA; dementia; double-stranded DNA breaks,,"Nguyen, M; Wood, C; Rios, A; Salter, Z; Reddy, PH"

Progranulin AAV gene therapy for frontotemporal dementia: translational studies and phase 1/2 trial interim results.,"GRN mutations cause progranulin haploinsufficiency, which eventually leads to frontotemporal dementia (FTD-GRN). PR006 is an investigational gene therapy delivering the granulin gene (GRN) using an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector. In non-clinical studies, PR006 transduced neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients with FTD-GRN, resulted in progranulin expression and improvement of lipofuscin, lysosomal and neuroinflammation pathologies in Grn-knockout mice, and was well tolerated except for minimal, asymptomatic dorsal root ganglionopathy in non-human primates. We initiated a first-in-human phase 1/2 open-label trial. Here we report results of a pre-specified interim analysis triggered with the last treated patient of the low-dose cohort (n = 6) reaching the 12-month follow-up timepoint. We also include preliminary data from the mid-dose cohort (n = 7). Primary endpoints were safety, immunogenicity and change in progranulin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Secondary endpoints were Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) plus National Alzheimer's Disease Coordinating Center (NACC) Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) rating scale and levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL). One-time administration of PR006 into the cisterna magna was generally safe and well tolerated. All patients developed treatment-emergent anti-AAV9 antibodies in the CSF, but none developed anti-progranulin antibodies. CSF pleocytosis was the most common PR006-related adverse event. Twelve serious adverse events occurred, mostly unrelated to PR006. Deep vein thrombosis developed in three patients. There was one death (unrelated) occurring 18 months after treatment. CSF progranulin increased after PR006 treatment in all patients; blood progranulin increased in most patients but only transiently. NfL levels transiently increased after PR006 treatment, likely reflecting dorsal root ganglia toxicity. Progression rates, based on the CDR scale, were within the broad ranges reported for patients with FTD. These data provide preliminary insights into the safety and bioactivity of PR006. Longer follow-up and additional studies are needed to confirm the safety and potential efficacy of PR006.

Clinical and CSF single-cell profiling of post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment.,"Natural history and mechanisms for persistent cognitive symptoms (""brain fog"") following acute and often mild COVID-19 are unknown. In a large prospective cohort of people who underwent testing a median of 9 months after acute COVID-19 in the New York City/New Jersey area, we found that cognitive dysfunction is common; is not influenced by mood, fatigue, or sleepiness; and is correlated with MRI changes in very few people. In a subgroup that underwent cerebrospinal fluid analysis, there are no changes related to Alzheimer's disease or neurodegeneration. Single-cell gene expression analysis in the cerebrospinal fluid shows findings consistent with monocyte recruitment, chemokine signaling, cellular stress, and suppressed interferon response-especially in myeloid cells. Longitudinal analysis shows slow recovery accompanied by key alterations in inflammatory genes and increased protein levels of CXCL8, CCL3L1, and sTREM2.

Single-value brain activity scores reflect both severity and risk across the Alzheimer's continuum.,"Single-value scores reflecting the deviation from (FADE score) or similarity with (SAME score) prototypical novelty-related and memory-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns in young adults have been proposed as imaging biomarkers of healthy neurocognitive aging. Here, we tested the utility of these scores as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD). To this end, we analyzed subsequent memory fMRI data from individuals with SCD, MCI, and AD dementia as well as healthy controls (HC) and first-degree relatives of AD dementia patients (AD-rel) who participated in the multi-center DELCODE study (N = 468). Based on the individual participants' whole-brain fMRI novelty and subsequent memory responses, we calculated the FADE and SAME scores and assessed their association with AD risk stage, neuropsychological test scores, CSF amyloid positivity, and ApoE genotype. Memory-based FADE and SAME scores showed a considerably larger deviation from a reference sample of young adults in the MCI and AD dementia groups compared to HC, SCD and AD-rel. In addition, novelty-based scores significantly differed between the MCI and AD dementia groups. Across the entire sample, single-value scores correlated with neuropsychological test performance. The novelty-based SAME score further differed between Aβ-positive and Aβ-negative individuals in SCD and AD-rel, and between ApoE ε4 carriers and non-carriers in AD-rel. Hence, FADE and SAME scores are associated with both cognitive performance and individual risk factors for AD. Their potential utility as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers warrants further exploration, particularly in individuals with SCD and healthy relatives of AD dementia patients.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; dementia risk; fMRI scores; mild cognitive impairment; novelty processing; subsequent memory,,"Soch, J; Richter, A; Kizilirmak, JM; Schütze, H; Ziegler, G; Altenstein, S; Brosseron, F; Dechent, P; Fliessbach, K; Freiesleben, SD; Glanz, W; Gref, D; Heneka, MT; Hetzer, S; Incesoy, EI; Kilimann, I; Kimmich, O; Kleineidam, L; Kuhn, E; Laske, C; Lohse, A; Lüsebrink, F; Munk, MH; Peters, O; Preis, L; Priller, J; Ramirez, A; Roeske, S; Rostamzadeh, A; Roy-Kluth, N; Scheffler, K; Schmid, M; Schneider, A; Spottke, A; Spruth, EJ; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Jessen, F; Wagner, M; Düzel, E; Schott, BH"
Blood-CSF barrier integrity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The integrity of the blood-CSF barrier plays a major role in inflammation, but also in shielding the central nervous system from external and systemic - potentially toxic - factors. Here we report results of measurements of the albumin quotient - which is thought to mirror the integrity of the blood/CSF barrier - in 1059 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. The results were compared with groups of patients suffering from Alzheimer´s disease, facial palsy and tension headache. The albumin quotient, an accepted measure of the blood/CSF barrier integrity, was not significantly different from control populations. In addition, we found that the albumin quotient correlated with survival of the patients; this effect was mainly driven by male patients and influenced by age, BMI and diabetes mellitus. We conclude that the blood/CSF barrier is intact in this large cohort of ALS patients and that the albumin quotient correlates with survival.

"Tau- and α-synuclein-targeted gold nanoparticles: applications, opportunities, and future outlooks in the diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.","The use of nanomaterials in medicine offers multiple opportunities to address neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These diseases are a significant burden for society and the health system, affecting millions of people worldwide without sensitive and selective diagnostic methodologies or effective treatments to stop their progression. In this sense, the use of gold nanoparticles is a promising tool due to their unique properties at the nanometric level. They can be functionalized with specific molecules to selectively target pathological proteins such as Tau and α-synuclein for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Additionally, these proteins are used as diagnostic biomarkers, wherein gold nanoparticles play a key role in enhancing their signal, even at the low concentrations present in biological samples such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid, thus enabling an early and accurate diagnosis. On the other hand, gold nanoparticles act as drug delivery platforms, bringing therapeutic agents directly into the brain, improving treatment efficiency and precision, and reducing side effects in healthy tissues. However, despite the exciting potential of gold nanoparticles, it is crucial to address the challenges and issues associated with their use in the medical field before they can be widely applied in clinical settings. It is critical to ensure the safety and biocompatibility of these nanomaterials in the context of the central nervous system. Therefore, rigorous preclinical and clinical studies are needed to assess the efficacy and feasibility of these strategies in patients. Since there is scarce and sometimes contradictory literature about their use in this context, the main aim of this review is to discuss and analyze the current state-of-the-art of gold nanoparticles in relation to delivery, diagnosis, and therapy for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as recent research about their use in preclinical, clinical, and emerging research areas.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Diagnosis; Parkinson’s disease; Protein misfolding; Theragnosis; Therapy,Humans; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; alpha-Synuclein; tau Proteins; Animals; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Drug Delivery Systems; Biomarkers,"Tapia-Arellano, A; Cabrera, P; Cortés-Adasme, E; Riveros, A; Hassan, N; Kogan, MJ"
Characterizing dysregulations via cell-cell communications in Alzheimer's brains using single-cell transcriptomes.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting 44 million people worldwide, leading to cognitive decline, memory loss, and significant impairment in daily functioning. The recent single-cell sequencing technology has revolutionized genetic and genomic resolution by enabling scientists to explore the diversity of gene expression patterns at the finest resolution. Most existing studies have solely focused on molecular perturbations within each cell, but cells live in microenvironments rather than in isolated entities. Here, we leveraged the large-scale and publicly available single-nucleus RNA sequencing in the human prefrontal cortex to investigate cell-to-cell communication in healthy brains and their perturbations in AD. We uniformly processed the snRNA-seq with strict QCs and labeled canonical cell types consistent with the definitions from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network. From ligand and receptor gene expression, we built a high-confidence cell-to-cell communication network to investigate signaling differences between AD and healthy brains.",2024,Alzheimer’s Disease; Brain; Cell-cell communication; Ligand-receptor; Network; Single-nucleus RNA-seq,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Cell Communication; Transcriptome; Single-Cell Analysis; Brain; Prefrontal Cortex; Neurons; Signal Transduction,"Lee, CY; Riffle, D; Xiong, Y; Momtaz, N; Lei, Y; Pariser, JM; Sikdar, D; Hwang, A; Duan, Z; Zhang, J"
Amyloid-β and Phosphorylated Tau are the Key Biomarkers and Predictors of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a age-related neurodegenerative disease and is a major public health concern both in Texas, US and Worldwide. This neurodegenerative disease is mainly characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) accumulation in the brains of patients with AD and increasing evidence suggests that these are key biomarkers in AD. Both Aβ and p-tau can be detected through various imaging techniques (such as positron emission tomography, PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The presence of these biomarkers in individuals, who are asymptomatic or have mild cognitive impairment can indicate an increased risk of developing AD in the future. Furthermore, the combination of Aβ and p-tau biomarkers is often used for more accurate diagnosis and prediction of AD progression. Along with AD being a neurodegenerative disease, it is associated with other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and diabetes because studies have shown that these comorbid conditions make people more vulnerable to AD. In the first part of this review, we discuss that biofluid-based biomarkers such as Aβ, p-Tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Aβ & p-Tau in plasma could be used as an alternative sensitive technique to diagnose AD. In the second part, we discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms of chronic conditions linked with AD and how they affect the patients in clinical care.",2024,,,"Pradeepkiran, JA; Baig, J; Islam, MA; Kshirsagar, S; Reddy, PH"
Changes in Astroglial Water Flow in the Pre-amyloid Phase of the STZ Model of AD Dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease that is typically sporadic and has a high social and economic cost. We utilized the intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (STZ), an established preclinical model for sporadic AD, to investigate hippocampal astroglial changes during the first 4 weeks post-STZ, a period during which amyloid deposition has yet to occur. Astroglial proteins aquaporin 4 (AQP-4) and connexin-43 (Cx-43) were evaluated, as well as claudins, which are tight junction (TJ) proteins in brain barriers, to try to identify changes in the glymphatic system and brain barrier during the pre-amyloid phase. Glial commitment, glucose hypometabolism and cognitive impairment were characterized during this phase. Astroglial involvement was confirmed by an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); concurrent proteolysis was also observed, possibly mediated by calpain. Levels of AQP-4 and Cx-43 were elevated in the fourth week post-STZ, possibly accelerating the clearance of extracellular proteins, since these proteins actively participate in the glymphatic system. Moreover, although we did not see a functional disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) at this time, claudin 5 (present in the TJ of the BBB) and claudin 2 (present in the TJ of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier) were reduced. Taken together, data support a role for astrocytes in STZ brain damage, and suggest that astroglial dysfunction accompanies or precedes neuronal damage in AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Aquaporin 4; Astrocyte; GFAP; Glymphatic System; Streptozotocin,"Astrocytes; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Streptozocin; Aquaporin 4; Connexin 43; Blood-Brain Barrier; Water; Hippocampus; Rats, Wistar; Rats; Disease Models, Animal","Gayger-Dias, V; Menezes, L; Da Silva, VF; Stiborski, A; Silva, ACR; Sobottka, TM; Quines-Silva, VC; Pakulski-Souto, B; Bobermin, LD; Quincozes-Santos, A; Leite, MC; Gonçalves, CA"
Inferior Frontal Sulcal Hyperintensities on Brain MRI Are Associated with Amyloid Positivity beyond Age-Results from the Multicentre Observational DELCODE Study.,"Inferior frontal sulcal hyperintensities (IFSHs) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences have been proposed to be indicative of glymphatic dysfunction. Replication studies in large and diverse samples are nonetheless needed to confirm them as an imaging biomarker. We investigated whether IFSHs were tied to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and cognitive performance. We used data from 361 participants along the AD continuum, who were enrolled in the multicentre DELCODE study. The IFSHs were rated visually based on FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging. We performed ordinal regression to examine the relationship between the IFSHs and cerebrospinal fluid-derived amyloid positivity and tau positivity (Aβ42/40 ratio ≤ 0.08; pTau181 ≥ 73.65 pg/mL) and linear regression to examine the relationship between cognitive performance (i.e., Mini-Mental State Examination and global cognitive and domain-specific performance) and the IFSHs. We controlled the models for age, sex, years of education, and history of hypertension. The IFSH scores were higher in those participants with amyloid positivity (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.05-3.59) but not tau positivity (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.57-2.18). The IFSH scores were higher in older participants (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.10) and lower in males compared to females (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26-0.76). We did not find sufficient evidence linking the IFSH scores with cognitive performance after correcting for demographics and AD biomarker positivity.

Circadian ABCG2 Expression Influences the Brain Uptake of Donepezil across the Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier.,"Donepezil (DNPZ) is a cholinesterase inhibitor used for the management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is dependent on membrane transporters such as ABCG2 to actively cross brain barriers and reach its target site of action in the brain. Located in the brain ventricles, the choroid plexus (CP) forms an interface between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the bloodstream, known as the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB). Historically, the BCSFB has received little attention as a potential pathway for drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Nonetheless, this barrier is presently viewed as a dynamic transport interface that limits the traffic of molecules into and out of the CNS through the presence of membrane transporters, with parallel activity with the BBB. The localization and expression of drug transporters in brain barriers represent a huge obstacle for drug delivery to the brain and a major challenge for the development of therapeutic approaches to CNS disorders. The widespread interest in understanding how circadian clocks modulate many processes that define drug delivery in order to predict the variability in drug safety and efficacy is the next bridge to improve effective treatment. In this context, this study aims at characterizing the circadian expression of ABCG2 and DNPZ circadian transport profile using an in vitro model of the BCSFB. We found that ABCG2 displays a circadian pattern and DNPZ is transported in a circadian way across this barrier. This study will strongly impact on the capacity to modulate the BCSFB in order to control the penetration of DNPZ into the brain and improve therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD according to the time of the day.",2024,ABCG2; Donepezil; blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier; circadian rhythm,"Donepezil; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2; Blood-Brain Barrier; Animals; Humans; Brain; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Biological Transport; Choroid Plexus; Alzheimer Disease; Mice; Circadian Rhythm; Neoplasm Proteins","Furtado, A; Duarte, AC; Costa, AR; Gonçalves, I; Santos, CRA; Gallardo, E; Quintela, T"
Unlocking Preclinical Alzheimer's: A Multi-Year Label-Free In Vitro Raman Spectroscopy Study Empowered by Chemometrics.,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the early detection of which is crucial for timely intervention and enrollment in clinical trials. However, the preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's encounters difficulties with gold-standard methods. The current definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's still relies on expensive instrumentation and post-mortem histological examinations. Here, we explore label-free Raman spectroscopy with machine learning as an alternative to preclinical Alzheimer's diagnosis. A special feature of this study is the inclusion of patient samples from different cohorts, sampled and measured in different years. To develop reliable classification models, partial least squares discriminant analysis in combination with variable selection methods identified discriminative molecules, including nucleic acids, amino acids, proteins, and carbohydrates such as taurine/hypotaurine and guanine, when applied to Raman spectra taken from dried samples of cerebrospinal fluid. The robustness of the model is remarkable, as the discriminative molecules could be identified in different cohorts and years. A unified model notably classifies preclinical Alzheimer's, which is particularly surprising because of Raman spectroscopy's high sensitivity regarding different measurement conditions. The presented results demonstrate the capability of Raman spectroscopy to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease for the first time and offer invaluable opportunities for future clinical applications and diagnostic methods.",2024,PLS-DA; cerebrospinal fluid; machine learning; preclinical Alzheimer’s; variable selection; vibrational spectroscopy,"Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Female; Biomarkers; Aged; Early Diagnosis","Lopez, E; Etxebarria-Elezgarai, J; García-Sebastián, M; Altuna, M; Ecay-Torres, M; Estanga, A; Tainta, M; López, C; Martínez-Lage, P; Amigo, JM; Seifert, A"
Assessment of the Correlation and Diagnostic Accuracy between Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers: A Comparison of the Lumipulse and Simoa Platforms.,"We compared the clinical and analytical performance of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers measured using the single-molecule array (Simoa) and Lumipulse platforms. We quantified the plasma levels of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), Aβ40, phosphorylated tau (Ptau181), and total tau biomarkers in 81 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 30 with AD, and 16 with non-AD dementia. We found a strong correlation between the Simoa and Lumipulse methods. Concerning the clinical diagnosis, Simoa Ptau181/Aβ42 (AUC 0.739, 95% CI 0.592-0.887) and Lumipulse Aβ42 and Ptau181/Aβ42 (AUC 0.735, 95% CI 0.589-0.882 and AUC 0.733, 95% CI 0.567-0.900) had the highest discriminating power. However, their power was significantly lower than that of CSF Aβ42/Aβ40, as measured by Lumipulse (AUC 0.879, 95% CI 0.766-0.992). Simoa Ptau181 and Lumipulse Ptau181/Aβ42 were the markers most consistent with the CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 status (AUC 0.801, 95% CI 0.712-0.890 vs. AUC 0.870, 95% CI 0.806-0.934, respectively) at the ≥2.127 and ≥0.084 cut-offs, respectively.

Abnormal EEG microstates in Alzheimer's disease: predictors of β-amyloid deposition degree and disease classification.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates are used to study cognitive processes and brain disease-related changes. However, dysfunctional patterns of microstate dynamics in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain uncertain. To investigate microstate changes in AD using EEG and assess their association with cognitive function and pathological changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We enrolled 56 patients with AD and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). All participants underwent various neuropsychological assessments and resting-state EEG recordings. Patients with AD also underwent CSF examinations to assess biomarkers related to the disease. Stepwise regression was used to analyze the relationship between changes in microstate patterns and CSF biomarkers. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to assess the potential of these microstate patterns as diagnostic predictors for AD. Compared with HC, patients with AD exhibited longer durations of microstates C and D, along with a decreased occurrence of microstate B. These microstate pattern changes were associated with Stroop Color Word Test and Activities of Daily Living scale scores (all P < 0.05).

Salivary biomarkers: The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"The precise identification of Alzheimer's disease and other prevalent neurodegenerative diseases remains a difficult issue that requires the development of early detection of the disease and inexpensive biomarkers that can replace the present cerebrospinal fluid and imaging biomarkers. Blood biomarkers, such as amyloid and neurofilament light, have been emphasized as an important and practical tool in a testing or examination procedure thanks to advancements in ultra-sensitive detection techniques. Although saliva is not currently being researched for neurodegenerative diseases, it is an important source of biomarkers that can be used for the identification of diseases and has some advantages over other biofluids. While this may be true for most people, getting saliva from elderly people presents some significant challenges. In this overview, we will first discuss how saliva is created and how aging-related illnesses may affect the amount and kind of saliva produced.

Distinct patterns of plaque and microglia glycosylation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Glycosylation is the most common form of post-translational modification in the brain. Aberrant glycosylation has been observed in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, including dysregulation of terminal sialic acid (SA) modifications. While alterations in sialylation have been identified in AD, the localization of SA modifications on cellular or aggregate-associated glycans is largely unknown because of limited spatial resolution of commonly utilized methods. The present study aims to overcome these limitations with novel combinations of histologic techniques to characterize the sialylation landscape of O- and N-linked glycans in autopsy-confirmed AD post-mortem brain tissue. Sialylated glycans facilitate important cellular functions including cell-to-cell interaction, cell migration, cell adhesion, immune regulation, and membrane excitability. Previous studies have not investigated both N- and O-linked sialylated glycans in neurodegeneration. In this study, the location and distribution of sialylated glycans were evaluated in three brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) from 10 AD cases using quantitative digital pathology techniques. Notably, we found significantly greater N-sialylation of the Aβ plaque microenvironment compared with O-sialylation. Plaque-associated microglia displayed the most intense N-sialylation proximal to plaque pathology. Further analyses revealed distinct differences in the levels of N- and O-sialylation between cored and diffuse Aβ plaque morphologies. Interestingly, phosphorylated tau pathology led to a slight increase in N-sialylation and no influence of O-sialylation in these AD brains. Confirming our previous observations in mice with novel histologic approach, these findings support microglia sialylation appears to have a relationship with AD protein aggregates while providing potential targets for therapeutic strategies.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; digital pathology; glycosylation; microglia; senile plaque; sialylation,,"Fastenau, C; Bunce, M; Keating, M; Wickline, J; Hopp, SC; Bieniek, KF"

Bacteroidota inhibit microglia clearance of amyloid-beta and promote plaque deposition in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,"The gut microbiota and microglia play critical roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and elevated Bacteroides is correlated with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau levels in AD. We hypothesize that Bacteroides contributes to AD by modulating microglia. Here we show that administering Bacteroides fragilis to APP/PS1-21 mice increases Aβ plaques in females, modulates cortical amyloid processing gene expression, and down regulates phagocytosis and protein degradation microglial gene expression. We further show that administering Bacteroides fragilis to aged wild-type male and female mice suppresses microglial uptake of Aβ1-42 injected into the hippocampus. Depleting murine Bacteroidota with metronidazole decreases amyloid load in aged 5xFAD mice, and activates microglial pathways related to phagocytosis, cytokine signaling, and lysosomal degradation. Taken together, our study demonstrates that members of the Bacteroidota phylum contribute to AD pathogenesis by suppressing microglia phagocytic function, which leads to impaired Aβ clearance and accumulation of amyloid plaques.",2024,,"Animals; Microglia; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Plaque, Amyloid; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Phagocytosis; Mice; Male; Mice, Transgenic; Bacteroides fragilis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Hippocampus","Wasén, C; Beauchamp, LC; Vincentini, J; Li, S; LeServe, DS; Gauthier, C; Lopes, JR; Moreira, TG; Ekwudo, MN; Yin, Z; da Silva, P; Krishnan, RK; Butovsky, O; Cox, LM; Weiner, HL"

APOE4 homozygozity represents a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's disease.,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of APOE4 homozygosity on Alzheimer's disease (AD) by examining its clinical, pathological and biomarker changes to see whether APOE4 homozygotes constitute a distinct, genetically determined form of AD. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and five large cohorts with AD biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis included 3,297 individuals for the pathological study and 10,039 for the clinical study. Findings revealed that almost all APOE4 homozygotes exhibited AD pathology and had significantly higher levels of AD biomarkers from age 55 compared to APOE3 homozygotes. By age 65, nearly all had abnormal amyloid levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and 75% had positive amyloid scans, with the prevalence of these markers increasing with age, indicating near-full penetrance of AD biology in APOE4 homozygotes. The age of symptom onset was earlier in APOE4 homozygotes at 65.1, with a narrower 95% prediction interval than APOE3 homozygotes. The predictability of symptom onset and the sequence of biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes mirrored those in autosomal dominant AD and Down syndrome. However, in the dementia stage, there were no differences in amyloid or tau positron emission tomography across haplotypes, despite earlier clinical and biomarker changes.

CSF neurofilament light chain profiling and quantitation in neurological diseases.,"Neurofilament light chain is an established marker of neuroaxonal injury that is elevated in CSF and blood across various neurological diseases. It is increasingly used in clinical practice to aid diagnosis and monitor progression and as an outcome measure to assess safety and efficacy of disease-modifying therapies across the clinical translational neuroscience field. Quantitative methods for neurofilament light chain in human biofluids have relied on immunoassays, which have limited capacity to describe the structure of the protein in CSF and how this might vary in different neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we characterized and quantified neurofilament light chain species in CSF across neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases and healthy controls using targeted mass spectrometry. We show that the quantitative immunoprecipitation-tandem mass spectrometry method developed in this study strongly correlates to single-molecule array measurements in CSF across the broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases and was replicable across mass spectrometry methods and centres.

Multiomics Blood-Based Biomarkers Predict Alzheimer's Predementia with High Specificity in a Multicentric Cohort Study.,"The primary criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or probable mild AD dementia rely partly on cognitive assessments and the presence of amyloid plaques. Although these criteria exhibit high sensitivity in predicting AD among cognitively impaired patients, their specificity remains limited. Notably, up to 25% of non-demented patients with amyloid plaques may be misdiagnosed with MCI due to AD, when in fact they suffer from a different brain disorder. The introduction of anti-amyloid antibodies complicates this scenario. Physicians must prioritize which amyloid-positive MCI patients receive these treatments, as not all are suitable candidates. Specifically, those with non-AD amyloid pathologies are not primary targets for amyloid-modifying therapies. Consequently, there is an escalating medical necessity for highly specific blood biomarkers that can accurately detect pre-dementia AD, thus optimizing amyloid antibody prescription.",2024,Alzheimer’s predementia; Blood-based biomarkers; animal model; machine learning; mass spectrometry,Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Male; Female; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Animals; Cohort Studies; Prodromal Symptoms; Multiomics,"Souchet, B; Michaïl, A; Heuillet, M; Dupuy-Gayral, A; Haudebourg, E; Pech, C; Berthemy, AA; Autelitano, F; Billoir, B; Domoto-Reilly, K; Fowler, C; Grabowski, T; Jayadev, S; Masters, CL; Braudeau, J"

Here we use a data-driven approach to demonstrate the existence of inter-individual variability in mean standardized CSF protein levels. We show that these non-disease related differences cause many commonly reported CSF biomarkers to be highly correlated, thereby producing misleading results if not accounted for. To adjust for this inter-individual variability, we identified and evaluated high-performing reference proteins which improved the diagnostic accuracy of key CSF AD biomarkers.

Brain high-throughput multi-omics data reveal molecular heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease.,"Unbiased data-driven omic approaches are revealing the molecular heterogeneity of Alzheimer disease. Here, we used machine learning approaches to integrate high-throughput transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiles with clinical and neuropathological data from multiple human AD cohorts. We discovered 4 unique multimodal molecular profiles, one of them showing signs of poor cognitive function, a faster pace of disease progression, shorter survival with the disease, severe neurodegeneration and astrogliosis, and reduced levels of metabolomic profiles. We found this molecular profile to be present in multiple affected cortical regions associated with higher Braak tau scores and significant dysregulation of synapse-related genes, endocytosis, phagosome, and mTOR signaling pathways altered in AD early and late stages. AD cross-omics data integration with transcriptomic data from an SNCA mouse model revealed an overlapping signature. Furthermore, we leveraged single-nuclei RNA-seq data to identify distinct cell-types that most likely mediate molecular profiles.

Mixture of regressions with multivariate responses for discovering subtypes in Alzheimer's biomarkers with detection limits.,"There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), except from autopsies, which motivates the use of unsupervised learning. A mixture of regressions is an unsupervised method that can simultaneously identify clusters from multiple biomarkers while learning within-cluster demographic effects. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD have detection limits, which create additional challenges. We apply a mixture of regressions with a multivariate truncated Gaussian distribution (also called a censored multivariate Gaussian mixture of regressions or a mixture of multivariate tobit regressions) to over 3,000 participants from the Emory Goizueta Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Emory Healthy Brain Study to examine amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42), total tau protein and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF with known detection limits. We address three gaps in the literature on mixture of regressions with a truncated multivariate Gaussian distribution: software availability; inference; and clustering accuracy. We discovered three clusters that tend to align with an AD group, a normal control profile and non-AD pathology. The CSF profiles differed by race, gender and the genetic marker ApoE4, highlighting the importance of considering demographic factors in unsupervised learning with detection limits.

Molecular Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Practical Guide to Their Appropriate Use and Interpretation in Clinical Practice.,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) represent a group of different diseases characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of the nervous system's cells. The diagnosis is challenging, especially in the early stages, due to no specific clinical signs and symptoms. In this context, laboratory medicine could support clinicians in detecting and differentiating NDs. Indeed, biomarkers could indicate the pathological mechanisms underpinning NDs. The ideal biofluid for detecting the biomarkers of NDs is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which has limitations, hampering its widespread use in clinical practice. However, intensive efforts are underway to introduce high-sensitivity analytical methods to detect ND biomarkers in alternative nonivasive biofluid, such as blood or saliva. This study presents an overview of the ND molecular biomarkers currently used in clinical practice.

Evaluating p-tau217 and p-tau231 as Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis and Differentiation of Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review.,"The escalating prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlights the urgent need to develop reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention. AD is characterized by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins, particularly p-tau217 and p-tau231, have been identified as promising biomarker candidates to differentiate the disease progression from preclinical stages. This narrative review is devoted to a critical evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of p-tau217 and p-tau231 levels in the detection of AD, measured in plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, compared to established biomarkers. Additionally, the efficacy of these markers in distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative disorders is examined. The significant advances offered by p-tau217 and p-tau231 in AD diagnostics are highlighted, demonstrating their unique utility in early detection and differential diagnosis. This comprehensive analysis not only confirms the excellent diagnostic capabilities of these markers, but also deepens the understanding of the molecular dynamics of AD, contributing to the broader scientific discourse on neurodegenerative diseases.

Blocking Microglial Proliferation by CSF-1R Inhibitor Does Not Alter the Neuroprotective Effects of Adoptive Regulatory T Cells in 3xTg Alzheimer's Disease Mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia exacerbates AD. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play roles in limiting neuroinflammation by converting microglial polarization. Therefore, adoptive Treg therapy is considered an attractive option for neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanism underlying Treg therapy via microglial modulation is not fully understood. In this study, we sought to determine whether adoptively transferred Tregs were effective when microglia proliferation was inhibited by using GW2580, which is an inhibitor of CSF1R. We found that inhibition of microglial proliferation during Treg transfer did not alter the therapeutic effects of Tregs on cognitive deficits and the accumulation of Aβ and pTAU in 3xTg-AD mice. The expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers in the hippocampus of 3xTg mice showed that GW2580 did not affect the inhibition of neuroinflammation by Treg transfer. Additionally, adoptively transferred Tregs were commonly detected in the brain on day 7 after transfer and their levels decreased slowly over 100 days. Our findings suggest that adoptively transferred Tregs can survive longer than 100 days in the brain, suppressing microglial activation and thus alleviating AD pathology. The present study provides valuable evidence to support the prolonged efficacy of adoptive Treg therapy in AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; GW2580; microglia; regulatory T cells,,"Park, SY; Cha, N; Kim, S; Chae, S; Lee, WJ; Jung, H; Bae, H"

Advancing insights into in vivo meningeal lymphatic vessels with stereoscopic wide-field photoacoustic microscopy.,"Meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) play a pivotal role in regulating metabolic waste from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the current limitations in field of view and resolution of existing imaging techniques impede understanding the stereoscopic morphology and dynamic behavior of mLVs in vivo. Here, we utilized dual-contrast functional photoacoustic microscopy to achieve wide-field intravital imaging of the lymphatic system, including mLVs and glymphatic pathways. The stereoscopic photoacoustic microscopy based on opto-acoustic confocal features has a depth imaging capability of 3.75 mm, facilitating differentiation between mLVs on the meninges and glymphatic pathways within the brain parenchyma. Subsequently, using this imaging technique, we were able to visualize the dynamic drainage of mLVs and identify a peak drainage period occurring around 20-40 min after injection, along with determining the flow direction from CSF to lymph nodes. Inspiringly, in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model, we observed that AD mice exhibit a ~ 70% reduction in drainage volume of mLVs compared to wild-type mice. With the development of AD, there is be continued decline in mLVs drainage volume. This finding clearly demonstrates that the AD mouse model has impaired CSF drainage. Our study opens up a horizon for understanding the brain's drainage mechanism and dissecting mLVs-associated neurological disorders.",2024,,,"Yang, F; Wang, Z; Shi, W; Wang, M; Ma, R; Zhang, W; Li, X; Wang, E; Xie, W; Zhang, Z; Shen, Q; Zhou, F; Yang, S"

Involvement of the glymphatic/meningeal lymphatic system in Alzheimer's disease: insights into proteostasis and future directions.," Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the abnormal accumulation of Aβ and tau proteins. There has long been a keen interest among researchers in understanding how Aβ and tau are ultimately cleared in the brain. The discovery of this glymphatic system introduced a novel perspective on protein clearance and it gained recognition as one of the major brain clearance pathways for clearing these pathogenic proteins in AD. This finding has sparked interest in exploring the potential contribution of the glymphatic/meningeal lymphatic system in AD.

Exploring neurodegenerative disorders using advanced magnetic resonance imaging of the glymphatic system.,"The glymphatic system, a macroscopic waste clearance system in the brain, is crucial for maintaining neural health. It facilitates the exchange of cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid, aiding the clearance of soluble proteins and metabolites and distributing essential nutrients and signaling molecules. Emerging evidence suggests a link between glymphatic dysfunction and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. These disorders are characterized by the accumulation and propagation of misfolded or mutant proteins, a process in which the glymphatic system is likely involved. Impaired glymphatic clearance could lead to the buildup of these toxic proteins, contributing to neurodegeneration. Understanding the glymphatic system's role in these disorders could provide insights into their pathophysiology and pave the way for new therapeutic strategies. Pharmacological enhancement of glymphatic clearance could reduce the burden of toxic proteins and slow disease progression. Neuroimaging techniques, particularly MRI-based methods, have emerged as promising tools for studying the glymphatic system ",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; glymphatic system; neurodegeneration; neuroimaging,,"Prasuhn, J; Xu, J; Hua, J; van Zijl, P; Knutsson, L"
Increase in activin A may counteract decline in synaptic plasticity with age.,"Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family, is widely recognized for its neurotrophic and neuroprotective function in the developing and injured brain, respectively. Moreover, in the healthy adult brain, activin A has been shown to tune signal processing at excitatory synapses in a fashion that improves cognitive performance. Because its level in human cerebrospinal fluid rises with age, we wondered whether activin A has a role in mitigating the gradual cognitive decline that healthy individuals experience in late-life. To interrogate the role of activin A in synaptic plasticity in the aging brain, we used an established transgenic mouse line, in which expression of a dominant-negative mutant of activin receptor IB (dnActRIB) serves to disrupt activin receptor signaling in a forebrain-specific fashion. In brain slices of young adult dnActRIB mice (2-4 months old), the NMDA receptor-dependent and -independent forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapse of the hippocampus were equally impaired relative to the extent of LTP measured in the wild-type preparation. Unexpectedly, the difference between the genotypes disappeared when the two forms of LTP were re-examined in slices from middle-aged mice (13-16 months old). Since the level of activin A and endogenous ActRIB both displayed a significant elevation in middle-aged hippocampus, we reasoned that with such a rise, the dominant-negative effect of the mutant receptors could be overcome. Substantiating this idea, we found that administration of recombinant activin A was indeed capable of restoring full-blown LTP in slices from young dnActRIB mice. Our data suggest that, beginning in the middle-aged brain, endogenous activin receptor signaling appears to become strengthened in an attempt to stave off cognitive decline. If further corroborated, this concept would also hold promise for new therapeutic venues to preserve cognitive functions in the aged brain.",2024,LTP; activin; age; hippocampus; synaptic plasticity,,"Zheng, F; Dahlmanns, M; Kessler, P; Alzheimer, C"
Precise prediction of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta protein for early Alzheimer's disease detection using multimodal data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes a neurodegenerative disorder marked by a progressive decline in cognitive function and memory capacity. The accurate diagnosis of this condition predominantly relies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers, notwithstanding the associated burdens of pain and substantial financial costs endured by patients. This study encompasses subjects exhibiting varying degrees of cognitive impairment, encompassing individuals with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia, constituting a total sample size of 82 participants. The primary objective of this investigation is to explore the relationships among brain atrophy measurements derived from magnetic resonance imaging, atypical electroencephalography (EEG) patterns, behavioral assessment scales, and amyloid β-protein (Aβ) indicators. The findings of this research reveal that individuals displaying reduced Aβ1-42/Aβ-40 levels exhibit significant atrophy in the frontotemporal lobe, alongside irregularities in various parameters related to EEG frequency characteristics, signal complexity, inter-regional information exchange, and microstates. The study additionally endeavors to estimate Aβ1-42/Aβ-40 content through the application of a random forest algorithm, amalgamating structural data, electrophysiological features, and clinical scales, achieving a remarkable predictive precision of 91.6%. In summary, this study proposes a cost-effective methodology for acquiring CSF markers, thereby offering a valuable tool for the early detection of AD.",2024,EEG; MRI; amyloid beta protein; cerebrospinal fluid,,"Sun, J; Xie, Z; Sun, Y; Shen, A; Li, R; Yuan, X; Lu, B; Li, Y"

Fiber-in-tube SPME-CapLC-MS/MS method to determine Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from Alzheimer's patients.,"Mass spectrometry is characterized by its high sensitivity, ability to measure very low analyte concentrations, specificity to distinguish between closely related compounds, availability to generate high-throughput methods for screening, and high multiplexing capacity. This technique has been used as a platform to analyze fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. However, more effective sample preparation procedures, preferably antibody-independent, and more automated mass spectrometry platforms with improved sensitivity, chromatographic separation, and high throughput are needed for this purpose. This short communication discusses the development of a fiber-in-tube SPME-CapLC-MS/MS method to determine Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from Alzheimer's disease patients.

Human brain clearance imaging: Pathways taken by magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents after administration in cerebrospinal fluid and blood.,"Over the last decade, it has become evident that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a pivotal role in brain solute clearance through perivascular pathways and interactions between the brain and meningeal lymphatic vessels. Whereas most of this fundamental knowledge was gained from rodent models, human brain clearance imaging has provided important insights into the human system and highlighted the existence of important interspecies differences. Current gold standard techniques for human brain clearance imaging involve the injection of gadolinium-based contrast agents and monitoring their distribution and clearance over a period from a few hours up to 2 days. With both intrathecal and intravenous injections being used, which each have their own specific routes of distribution and thus clearance of contrast agent, a clear understanding of the kinetics associated with both approaches, and especially the differences between them, is needed to properly interpret the results. Because it is known that intrathecally injected contrast agent reaches the blood, albeit in small concentrations, and that similarly some of the intravenously injected agent can be detected in CSF, both pathways are connected and will, in theory, reach the same compartments. However, because of clear differences in relative enhancement patterns, both injection approaches will result in varying sensitivities for assessment of different subparts of the brain clearance system. In this opinion review article, the ""EU Joint Programme - Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND)"" consortium on human brain clearance imaging provides an overview of contrast agent pharmacokinetics in vivo following intrathecal and intravenous injections and what typical concentrations and concentration-time curves should be expected. This can be the basis for optimizing and interpreting contrast-enhanced MRI for brain clearance imaging.

"Brain border-associated macrophages: common denominators in infection, aging, and Alzheimer's disease?","Mammalian brain border-associated macrophages (BAMs) are strategically positioned to support vital properties and processes: for example, the composition of the brain's perivascular extracellular matrix and cerebrospinal fluid flow via the glymphatic pathway. BAMs also effectively restrict the spread of infectious microbes into the brain. However, while fighting infections, BAMs sustain long-term transcriptomic changes and can be replaced by inflammatory monocytes, potentially leading to a gradual loss of their beneficial homeostatic functions. We hypothesize that by expediting the deterioration of BAMs, multiple infection episodes might be associated with accelerated brain aging and the putative development of neurodegenerative diseases. Our viewpoint is supported by recent studies suggesting that rejuvenating aged BAMs, and counterbalancing their detrimental inflammatory signatures during infections, might hold promise in treating aging-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).",2024,,Animals; Humans; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Infections; Macrophages,"Da Mesquita, S; Rua, R"
Growth-Associated Protein 43 and Tensor-Based Morphometry Indices in Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) is found in the axonal terminal of neurons in the limbic system, which is affected in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assumed GAP-43 may contribute to AD progression and serve as a biomarker. So, in a two-year follow-up study, we assessed GAP-43 changes and whether they are correlated with tensor-based morphometry (TBM) findings in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We included MCI and cognitively normal (CN) people with available baseline and follow-up cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 and TBM findings from the ADNI database. We assessed the difference between the two groups and correlations in each group at each time point. CSF GAP-43 and TBM measures were similar in the two study groups in all time points, except for the accelerated anatomical region of interest (ROI) of CN subjects that were significantly greater than those of MCI. The only significant correlations with GAP-43 observed were those inverse correlations with accelerated and non-accelerated anatomical ROI in MCI subjects at baseline. Plus, all TBM metrics decreased significantly in all study groups during the follow-up in contrast to CSF GAP-43 levels. Our study revealed significant associations between CSF GAP-43 levels and TBM indices among people of the AD spectrum.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Growth-associated protein 43; Mild cognitive impairment; Region of interest; Tensor-based morphometry,,"Seyedmirzaei, H; Salmannezhad, A; Ashayeri, H; Shushtari, A; Farazinia, B; Heidari, MM; Momayezi, A; Shaki Baher, S"

"Difference of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Profiles among Normal Cognition, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Dementia Patient.","The delineation of biomarkers and neuropsychiatric symptoms across normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia stages holds significant promise for early diagnosis and intervention strategies. This research investigates the association of neuropsychiatric symptoms, evaluated via the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Amyloid-β42, P-tau, T-tau) across a spectrum of cognitive states to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment approaches. Drawing from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set Version 3, comprising 977 individuals with normal cognition, 270 with MCI, and 649 with dementia.

Constitutive NOS Production Is Modulated by Alzheimer's Disease Pathology Depending on APOE Genotype.,"Both the endothelial (eNOS) and the neuronal (nNOS) isoforms of constitutive Nitric Oxide Synthase have been implicated in vascular dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to explore the relationship between amyloid pathology and NO dynamics by comparing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of nNOS and eNOS of 8 healthy controls (HC) and 27 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and isolated CSF amyloid changes, stratified according to APOE ε genotype (APOE ε3 = 13, APOE ε4 = 14). Moreover, we explored the associations between NOS isoforms, CSF AD biomarkers, age, sex, cognitive decline, and blood-brain barrier permeability. In our cohort, both eNOS and nNOS levels were increased in APOE ε3 with respect to HC and APOE ε4. CSF eNOS inversely correlated with CSF Amyloid-β42 selectively in carriers of APOE ε3; CSF nNOS was negatively associated with age and CSF p-tau only in the APOE ε4 subgroup. Increased eNOS could represent compensative vasodilation to face progressive Aβ-induced vasoconstriction in APOE ε3, while nNOS could represent the activation of NO-mediated plasticity strategies in the same group.

Specific Binding of Alzheimer's Aβ Peptides to Extracellular Vesicles.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth leading cause of death among adults aged 65 and older, yet the onset and progression of the disease is poorly understood. What is known is that the presence of amyloid, particularly polymerized Aβ42, defines when people are on the AD continuum. Interestingly, as AD progresses, less Aβ42 is detectable in the plasma, a phenomenon thought to result from Aβ becoming more aggregated in the brain and less Aβ42 and Aβ40 being transported from the brain to the plasma via the CSF. We propose that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in this transport. EVs are found in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid and carry diverse ""cargos"" of bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites) that dynamically reflect changes in the cells from which they are secreted. While Aβ42 and Aβ40 have been reported to be present in EVs, it is not known whether this interaction is specific for these peptides and thus whether amyloid-carrying EVs play a role in AD and/or serve as brain-specific biomarkers of the AD process. To determine if there is a specific interaction between Aβ and EVs, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and discovered that Aβ42 and Aβ40 bind to EVs in a manner that is sequence specific, saturable, and endothermic. In addition, Aβ incubation with EVs overnight yielded larger amounts of bound Aβ peptide that was fibrillar in structure. These findings point to a specific amyloid-EV interaction, a potential role for EVs in the transport of amyloid from the brain to the blood, and a role for this amyloid pool in the AD process.",2024,amyloid; atomic force microscopy (AFM); extracellular vesicles (EVs); isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),Adult; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Peptides; Extracellular Vesicles; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Plasma,"Coughlan, C; Lindenberger, J; Jacot, JG; Johnson, NR; Anton, P; Bevers, S; Welty, R; Graner, MW; Potter, H"

Neurofilaments as biomarkers in neurological disorders - towards clinical application.,"Neurofilament proteins have been validated as specific body fluid biomarkers of neuro-axonal injury. The advent of highly sensitive analytical platforms that enable reliable quantification of neurofilaments in blood samples and simplify longitudinal follow-up has paved the way for the development of neurofilaments as a biomarker in clinical practice. Potential applications include assessment of disease activity, monitoring of treatment responses, and determining prognosis in many acute and chronic neurological disorders as well as their use as an outcome measure in trials of novel therapies. Progress has now moved the measurement of neurofilaments to the doorstep of routine clinical practice for the evaluation of individuals. In this Review, we first outline current knowledge on the structure and function of neurofilaments. We then discuss analytical and statistical approaches and challenges in determining neurofilament levels in different clinical contexts and assess the implications of neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in normal ageing and the confounding factors that need to be considered when interpreting NfL measures. In addition, we summarize the current value and potential clinical applications of neurofilaments as a biomarker of neuro-axonal damage in a range of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke and cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson disease. We also consider the steps needed to complete the translation of neurofilaments from the laboratory to the management of neurological diseases in clinical practice.",2024,,Humans; Biomarkers; Nervous System Diseases; Neurofilament Proteins; Intermediate Filaments,"Khalil, M; Teunissen, CE; Lehmann, S; Otto, M; Piehl, F; Ziemssen, T; Bittner, S; Sormani, MP; Gattringer, T; Abu-Rumeileh, S; Thebault, S; Abdelhak, A; Green, A; Benkert, P; Kappos, L; Comabella, M; Tumani, H; Freedman, MS; Petzold, A; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Leppert, D; Kuhle, J"
Surface protein profiling and subtyping of extracellular vesicles in body fluids reveals non-CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"Noninvasive and effortless diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains challenging. Here we report the multiplexed profiling of extracellular vesicle (EV) surface proteins at the single EV level in five types of easily accessible body fluids using a proximity barcoding assay (PBA). A total of 183 surface proteins were detected on the EVs from body fluids collected from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and patients with AD. The AD-associated differentially expressed EV proteins could discriminate between the control and AD/AD model samples with high accuracy. Based on machine learning predictive models, urinary EV proteins exhibited the highest diagnostic potential compared to those on other biofluid EVs, both in mice and humans. Single EV analysis further revealed AD-associated EV subpopulations in the tested body fluids, and a urinary EV subpopulation with the signature proteins PLAU, ITGAX and ANXA1 could diagnose patients with AD in blinded datasets with 88% accuracy. Our results suggest that EVs and their subpopulations from noninvasive body fluids, particularly urine, are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; diagnostic biomarker; extracellular vesicles; noninvasive body fluids; proximity barcoding assay; surface protein profiling,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Mice, Transgenic; Membrane Proteins; Body Fluids","Cai, Y; Chen, T; Cai, Y; Liu, J; Yu, B; Fan, Y; Su, J; Zeng, Y; Xiao, X; Ren, L; Tang, Y"

Proteome-wide association studies using summary proteomic data identified 23 risk genes of Alzheimer's disease.,"Characterizing the genetic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is crucial for developing new therapeutics. Proteome-wide association study (PWAS) integrating proteomics data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data was shown as a powerful tool for detecting risk genes. The identified PWAS risk genes can be interpretated as having genetic effects mediated through the genetically regulated protein abundances. Existing PWAS analyses of AD often rely on the availability of individual-level proteomics and genetics data of a reference cohort. Leveraging summary-level protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) reference data of multiple relevant tissues is expected to improve PWAS findings for studying AD. Here, we applied our recently developed OTTERS tool to conduct PWAS of AD dementia, by leveraging summary-level pQTL data of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma tissues, and multiple statistical methods. For each target protein, imputation models of the protein abundance with genetic predictors were trained from summary-level pQTL data, estimating a set of pQTL weights for considered genetic predictors. PWAS p-values were obtained by integrating GWAS summary data of AD dementia with estimated pQTL weights. PWAS p-values from multiple statistical methods were combined by the aggregated Cauchy association test to yield one omnibus PWAS p-value for the target protein. We identified significant PWAS risk genes through omnibus PWAS p-values and analyzed their protein-protein interactions using STRING. Their potential causal effects were assessed by the probabilistic Mendelian randomization (PMR-Egger). As a result, we identified a total of 23 significant PWAS risk genes for AD dementia in brain, CSF, and plasma tissues, including 7 novel findings. We showed that 15 of these risk genes were interconnected within a protein-protein interaction network involving the well-known AD risk gene of ",2024,Alzheimer’s disease dementia; GWAS; OTTERS; PWAS; pQTL summary data,,"Hu, T; Dai, Q; Epstein, MP; Yang, J"

Understanding central nervous system fluid networks: Historical perspectives and a revised model for clinical neurofluid imaging.,"The central nervous system (CNS) lacks traditionally defined lymphatic vasculature. However, CNS tissues and barriers compartmentalize the brain, spinal cord, and adjacent spaces, facilitating the transmittal of fluids, metabolic wastes, immune cells, and vital signals, while more conventional lymphatic pathways in the meninges, cervicofacial and paraspinal regions transmit efflux fluid and molecules to peripheral lymph and lymph nodes. Thus, a unique and highly organized fluid circulation network encompassing intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, dural, and extradural segments functions in unison to maintain CNS homeostasis. Pathways involved in this system have been under investigation for centuries and continue to be the source of considerable interest and debate. Modern imaging and microscopy technologies have led to important breakthroughs pertaining to various elements of CNS fluid circuitry and exchange over the past decade, thus enhancing knowledge on mechanisms of mammalian CNS maintenance and disease. Yet, to better understand precise anatomical routes, the physiology and clinical significance of these CNS pathways, and potential therapeutic targets in humans, fluid conduits, flow-regulating factors, and tissue effects must be analyzed systematically and in a global manner in persons across age, demographical factors, and disease states. Here, we illustrate the system-wide nature of intermixing CNS fluid networks, summarize historical and clinical studies, and discuss anatomical and physiological similarities and differences that are relevant for translation of evidence from mice to humans. We also review Cushing's classical model of cerebrospinal fluid flow and present a new framework of this ""third circulation"" that emphasizes previously unexplained complexities of CNS fluid circulation in humans. Finally, we review future directions in the field, including emerging theranostic techniques and MRI studies required in humans.",2024,CNS fluid networks; MRI; cerebrospinal fluid; in vivo imaging; interstitial fluid; meningeal lymphatic system,,"Mehta, RI; Mehta, RI"

Increased molar ratio of free fatty acids to albumin in blood as cause and early biomarker for the development of cataracts and Alzheimer's disease.,"Cataracts and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are closely linked and are associated with aging and with systemic diseases that increase the molar ratio of free fatty acids to albumin (mFAR) in the blood. From the results of our earlier studies on the development of senile cataracts and from results recently published in the literature on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, we suggest that there is a common lipotoxic cascade for both diseases, explaining the strong connection between aging, an elevated mFAR in the blood, cataract formation, and AD. Long-chain free fatty acids (FFA) are transported in the blood as FFA/albumin complexes. In young people, vascular albumin barriers in the eyes and brain, very similar in their structure and effect, reduce the FFA/albumin complex concentration from around 650 μmol/l in the blood to 1-3 μmol/l in the aqueous humour of the eyes as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid of the brain. At such low concentrations the fatty acid uptake of the target cells - lens epithelial and brain cells - rises with increasing FFA/albumin complex concentrations, especially when the fatty acid load of albumin molecules is mFAR>1. At higher albumin concentrations, for instance in blood plasma or the interstitial tissue spaces, the fatty acid uptake of the target cells becomes increasingly independent of the FFA/albumin complex concentration and is mainly a function of the mFAR (Richieri et al., 1993). In the blood plasma of young people, the mFAR is normally below 1.0. In people over 40 years old, aging increases the mFAR by decreasing the plasma concentration of albumin and enhancing the plasma concentrations of FFA. The increase in the mFAR in association with C6-unsaturated FFA are risk factors for the vascular albumin barriers (Hennig et al., 1984). Damage to the vascular albumin barrier in the eyes and brain increases the concentration of FFA/albumin complex in the aqueous humour as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the death of lens epithelial and brain cells, the development of cataracts, and AD. An age-dependent increase in the concentration of FFA/albumin complex has been found in the aqueous humour of 177 cataract patients, correlating with the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic death of lens epithelial cells, lens opacification and cataracts (Iwig et al., 2004). Mitochondrial dysfunction is also an early crucial event in Alzheimer's pathology, closely connected with the generation of amyloid beta peptides (Leuner et al., 2012). Very recently, amyloid beta production has also been confirmed in the lenses of Alzheimer's patients, causing cataracts (Moncaster et al., 2022). In view of this, we propose that there is a common lipotoxic cascade for senile cataract formation and senile AD, initiated by aging and/or systemic diseases, leading to an mFAR>1 in the blood.",2024,Aging; Albumin; Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; Cataracts; Free fatty acids; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Vascular albumin barriers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cataract; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Biomarkers; Serum Albumin; Aging; Lens, Crystalline","Glaesser, D; Iwig, M"

However, established biomarkers are still missing. Innovative diagnostic techniques, such as single-molecule array analysis, enable the detection of biomarkers in blood at picomolar concentrations. This approach paves the way for deeper insights into delirium and potentially therapeutic targets for tailored medical treatments. In a retrospective 3-year study, we investigated seven biomarkers indicative of neuroaxonal damage [neurofilament light chain (NFL), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCHL-1), and tau protein], microglial activation [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2)], and synaptic dysfunction [synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) and neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2)]. The analysis of 71 patients with delirium, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-AD controls revealed that serum NFL levels are higher in delirium cases compared to both AD and non-AD. This suggests that elevated NFL levels in delirium are not exclusively the result of dementia-related damage. Serum tau levels were also elevated in delirium cases compared to controls. Conversely, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SNAP-25 showed higher levels in AD patients compared to controls only. These findings add to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that serum NFL could be a valuable biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in delirium research. Although SNAP-25 and NPTX2 did not exhibit significant differences in delirium, the exploration of synaptic biomarkers remains promising for enhancing our understanding of this condition.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; delirium; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neurofilament light chain; neuronal pentraxin 2; single-molecule array; soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; tau protein,,"Piel, JHA; Bargemann, L; Leypoldt, F; Wandinger, KP; Dargvainiene, J"

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio associates with markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology in cognitively unimpaired elderly people.,"An elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in blood has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an elevated NLR has also been implicated in many other conditions that are risk factors for AD, prompting investigation into whether the NLR is directly linked with AD pathology or a result of underlying comorbidities. Herein, we explored the relationship between the NLR and AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Adjusting for sociodemographics, APOE4, and common comorbidities, we investigated these associations in two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the M.J. de Leon CSF repository at NYU.

CSF proteomic profiling with amyloid/tau positivity identifies distinctive sex-different alteration of multiple proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, females have higher prevalence and faster progression, but sex-specific molecular findings in AD are limited. Here, we comprehensively examined and validated 7,006 aptamers targeting 6,162 proteins in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from 2,077 amyloid/tau positive cases and controls to identify sex-specific proteomic signatures of AD. In discovery (N=1,766), we identified 330 male-specific and 121 female-specific proteomic alternations in CSF (FDR <0.05). These sex-specific proteins strongly predicted amyloid/tau positivity (AUC=0.98 in males; 0.99 in females), significantly higher than those with age, sex, and APOE-ε4 (AUC=0.85). The identified sex-specific proteins were well validated (r≥0.5) in the Stanford study (N=108) and Emory study (N=148). Biological follow-up of these proteins led to sex differences in cell-type specificity, pathways, interaction networks, and drug targets. Male-specific proteins, enriched in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, were involved in postsynaptic and axon-genesis. The male network exhibited direct connections among 152 proteins and highlighted PTEN, NOTCH1, FYN, and MAPK8 as hubs. Drug target suggested melatonin (used for sleep-wake cycle regulation), nabumetone (used for pain), daunorubicin, and verteporfin for treating AD males. In contrast, female-specific proteins, enriched in neurons, were involved in phosphoserine residue binding including cytokine activities. The female network exhibits strong connections among 51 proteins and highlighted JUN and 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAG and YWHAZ) as hubs. Drug target suggested biperiden (for muscle control of Parkinson's disease), nimodipine (for cerebral vasospasm), quinostatin and ethaverine for treating AD females.

Cognitive modeling of the Mnemonic Similarity Task as a digital biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease.,"AD related pathologies, such as beta-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are evident decades before any noticeable decline in memory occurs. Identifying individuals during this asymptomatic phase is crucial for timely intervention. The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST), a modified recognition memory task, is especially relevant for early AD screening, as it assesses hippocampal integrity, a region affected (both directly and indirectly) early in the progression of the disease. Further, strong inferences on the underlying cognitive mechanisms that support performance on this task can be made using Bayesian cognitive modeling. We assessed whether analyzing MST performance using a cognitive model could detect subtle changes in cognitive function and AD biomarker status prior to overt cognitive decline. We analyzed MST data from >200 individuals (young, cognitively healthy older adults, and individuals with MCI), a subset of which also had existing CSF Aβ and pTau data. Traditional performance scores and cognitive modeling using multinomial processing trees was applied to each participants MST data using Bayesian approaches. We assessed how well each could predict age group, memory ability, MCI status, Aβ/pTau status using ROC analyses. Both approaches predicted age group membership equally, but cognitive modeling approaches exceeded traditional metrics in all other comparisons. This work establishes that cognitive modeling of the MST can detect individuals with AD prior to cognitive decline, making it a potentially useful tool for both screening and monitoring older adults during the asymptomatic phase of AD.",2024,,,"Vanderlip, C; Lee, MD; Stark, CEL"

However, there is an urgent need for biomarkers to assist in monitoring not only the progression of disease but also the response to treatment. GFAP is the obvious candidate for such a biomarker, as it is measurable in body fluids that are readily accessible for biopsy, namely cerebrospinal fluid and blood.

The involvement of neuroinflammation in an animal model of dementia and depression.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression are inflammatory pathologies, leading to increased inflammatory response and neurotoxicity. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of the treatment with fluoxetine and/or galantamine and/or donepezil on the levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in a mixed animal model of depression and dementia. Adult male Wistar rats underwent chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol for 40 days and were subjected to stereotaxic surgery for intra-hippocampal administration of amyloid-beta (Aꞵ) peptide or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) to mimic the dementia animal model. On the 42nd day, animals were treated with water, galantamine, donepezil, and/or fluoxetine, orally for 17 days. On the 57th and 58th days, the Splash and Y-maze tests for behavior analysis were performed. The frontal cortex and hippocampus were used to analyze the tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1ꞵ), IL-6, and IL-10 levels. The results of this study show that animals subjected to CMS and administration of Aꞵ had anhedonia, cognitive impairment, increased TNF-α and IL-1ꞵ levels in the frontal cortex, and reduced IL-10 levels in the hippocampus. All treatment groups were able to reverse the cognitive impairment. Only donepezil did not decrease the TNF-α levels in the hippocampus. Fluoxetine + galantamine and fluoxetine + donepezil reversed the anhedonia. Fluoxetine reversed the anhedonia and IL-1ꞵ levels in the frontal cortex. In addition, fluoxetine + donepezil reversed the reduction of IL-10 levels in the hippocampus. The results indicate a pathophysiological interaction between AD and depression, and the association of medications in the future may be a possible therapeutic strategy to reduce inflammation, especially the fluoxetine-associated treatments.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Chronic mild stress; Cytokines; Depression; Donepezil; Fluoxetine; Galantamine; Inflammation,"Animals; Male; Rats, Wistar; Disease Models, Animal; Fluoxetine; Donepezil; Rats; Hippocampus; Dementia; Depression; Galantamine; Cytokines; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Stress, Psychological; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Anhedonia","Zabot, GC; Medeiros, EB; Macarini, BMN; Peruchi, BB; Keller, GS; Lídio, AV; Boaventura, A; de Jesus, LC; de Bem Silveira, G; Silveira, PCL; Chede, BC; Réus, GZ; Budni, J"

Nanomedicine: A New Frontier in Alzheimer's Disease Drug Targeting.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder affecting elderly individuals, characterized by progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia. This review examines the challenges posed by anatomical and biochemical barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), and p-glycoproteins in delivering effective therapeutic agents to the central nervous system (CNS) for AD treatment. This article outlines the fundamental role of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and NMDA(N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptor antagonists in conventional AD therapy and highlights their limitations in terms of brain-specific delivery. It delves into the intricacies of BBB and pglycoprotein-mediated efflux mechanisms that impede drug transport to the CNS. The review further discusses cutting-edge nanomedicine-based strategies, detailing their composition and mechanisms that enable effective bypassing of BBB and enhancing drug accumulation in brain tissues. Conventional therapies, namely AChEIs and NMDA receptor antagonists, have shown limited efficacy and are hindered by suboptimal brain penetration. The advent of nanotechnology-driven therapeutic delivery systems offers promising strategies to enhance CNS targeting and bioavailability, thereby addressing the shortcomings of conventional treatments. Various nanomedicines, encompassing polymeric and metallic nanoparticles (MNPs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), liposomes, micelles, dendrimers, nanoemulsions, and carbon nanotubes, have been investigated for their potential in delivering anti-AD agents like AChEIs, polyphenols, curcumin, and resveratrol. These nanocarriers exhibit the ability to traverse the BBB and deliver therapeutic payloads to the brain, thereby holding immense potential for effective AD treatment and early diagnostic approaches. Notably, nanocarriers loaded with AChEIs have shown promising results in preclinical studies, exhibiting improved therapeutic efficacy and sustained release profiles. This review underscores the urgency of innovative drug delivery approaches to overcome barriers in AD therapy. Nanomedicine-based solutions offer a promising avenue for achieving effective CNS targeting, enabling enhanced bioavailability and sustained therapeutic effects.

It is more difficult to include the post-translational modifications (PTMs) characterization of the peptidome in the mass spectrometry (MS) analysis because of their low abundance and the challenge of data interpretation. In this chapter, we present a peptidomic workflow that combines molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) separation, electron-transfer and higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) fragmentation, and a three-step database searching strategy for comprehensive PTM analysis of endogenous peptides including both N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation and other common peptide PTMs. The method has been successfully adopted to analyze CSF samples from healthy donors, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to provide a landscape of peptidome in different disease states.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; EThcD; Endogenous peptidome; Glycosylation; LC-MS/MS; PTM,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Peptides; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Glycosylation; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Wang, D; Chen, Z; Li, L"

Lumbar puncture increases Alzheimer's disease biomarker levels in cerebrospinal fluid of rhesus monkeys.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples are commonly collected via lumbar puncture (LP) in both clinical and research settings for measurement of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To determine the effects of LP on CSF AD biomarkers, we collected CSF samples at seven different time points after an LP in rhesus monkeys. We find that amyloid-beta (Aβ) and Tau levels increased significantly on day 1, peaked on day 3, and returned to baseline on day 10 after LP. The NFL levels increased significantly on day 5, peaked on day 10, and returned to baseline after day 30. The increased AD biomarker levels were mainly due to CSF outflow and deep intrathecal invasion during LP. Therefore, if LPs are repeated within a short period of time, prior LP can affect Aβ and Tau levels within 10 days and NFL levels within 30 days, which may lead to clinical misdiagnosis or incorrect scientific conclusions.",2024,Molecular medicine; Molecular neuroscience,,"Xu, J; Li, H; Hu, Y; Wu, S; Wu, L; Lei, X; Lv, L; Lu, Y; Wu, J; Li, J; Shi, B; Li, J; Turck, CW; Wang, W; Hu, X"

Sex Differences in Conversion Risk from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease: An Explainable Machine Learning Study with Random Survival Forests and SHAP.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits sex-linked variations, with women having a higher prevalence, and little is known about the sexual dimorphism in progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. The main aim of our study was to shed light on the sex-specific conversion-to-AD risk factors using Random Survival Forests (RSF), a Machine Learning survival approach, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) on dementia biomarkers in stable (sMCI) and progressive (pMCI) patients. With this purpose, we built two separate models for male (M-RSF) and female (F-RSF) cohorts to assess whether global explanations differ between the sexes. Similarly, SHAP local explanations were obtained to investigate changes across sexes in feature contributions to individual risk predictions. The M-RSF achieved higher performance on the test set (0.87) than the F-RSF (0.79), and global explanations of male and female models had limited similarity (<71.1%). Common influential variables across the sexes included brain glucose metabolism and CSF biomarkers. Conversely, the M-RSF had a notable contribution from hippocampus, which had a lower impact on the F-RSF, while verbal memory and executive function were key contributors only in F-RSF. Our findings confirmed that females had a higher risk of progressing to dementia; moreover, we highlighted distinct sex-driven patterns of variable importance, uncovering different feature contribution risks across sexes that decrease/increase the conversion-to-AD risk.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; random survival forests; sex differences,,"Sarica, A; Pelagi, A; Aracri, F; Arcuri, F; Quattrone, A; Quattrone, A"

Neuropathological changes associated with aberrant cerebrospinal fluid p-tau181 and Aβ42 in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.,"Recent studies suggest that increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau is associated with brain amyloid pathology rather than the tau pathology. However, confirmation using gold standard neuropathological assessments remains limited. This study aimed to determine background pathologies associated with aberrant CSF p-tau181 and amyloid-beta 1-42 (Aβ42) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. We retrospectively studied all patients with antemortem CSF and postmortem neuropathologic data at our institution. Comprehensive neuropathologic assessments were conducted for all patients, including Thal phase, Braak NFT stage, and CERAD score for AD. CSF concentrations of p-tau181 and Aβ42 were compared between AD neuropathological scores at autopsy by one-way ANOVA stratified by other pathologies. A total of 127 patients with AD (n = 22), Lewy body disease (n = 26), primary tauopathies (n = 30), TDP-43 proteinopathy (n = 16), and other diseases (n = 33) were included. The age at lumbar puncture was 76.3 ± 9.1 years, 40.8% were female, and median time from lumbar puncture to autopsy was 637 (175-1625) days. While Braak NFT 0-II was prevalent without amyloid pathology, Braak NFT ≥IV was observed exclusively in patients with amyloid pathology. Stratified analyses showed that CSF p-tau181 was slightly but significantly higher in patients with high Thal phase or CERAD score even in those with Braak NFT 0-II at autopsy. In patients with amyloid pathology, CSF p-tau181 was significantly and more profoundly elevated in those with Braak NFT ≥III at autopsy. CSF Aβ42 was lower in patients with high amyloid pathological scores. However, 34% with Thal ≤ 2 and 38% with CERAD ≤ sparse also showed decreased Aβ42. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) were overrepresented in this group. These results neuropathologically confirmed previous studies that CSF p-tau181 levels were slightly elevated with amyloid pathology alone and were even higher with tau pathology, and that CSFAβ42 can be decreased in PSP/CBD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid beta-peptides; Biomarkers; Cerebrospinal fluid; Corticobasal degeneration; Dementia with lewy bodies; Neuropathology; Progressive supranuclear palsy; Tau proteins; Tauopathies,Humans; Female; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Retrospective Studies; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid; Biomarkers,"Kurihara, M; Matsubara, T; Morimoto, S; Arakawa, A; Ohse, K; Kanemaru, K; Iwata, A; Murayama, S; Saito, Y"

Amyloid pathology mediates the associations between plasma fibrinogen and cognition in non-demented adults.,"Though previous studies revealed the potential associations of elevated levels of plasma fibrinogen with dementia, there is still limited understanding regarding the influence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers on these associations. We sought to investigate the interrelationships among fibrinogen, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, and cognition in non-demented adults. We included 1996 non-demented adults from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study and 337 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The associations of fibrinogen with AD biomarkers and cognition were explored using multiple linear regression models. The mediation analyses with 10 000 bootstrapped iterations were conducted to explore the mediating effects of AD biomarkers on cognition. In addition, interaction analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the influence of covariates on the relationships between fibrinogen and AD biomarkers. Participants exhibiting low Aβ42 were designated as A+, while those demonstrating high phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and total tau (Tau) were labeled as T+ and N+, respectively. Individuals with normal measures of Aβ42 and P-tau were categorized as the A-T- group, and those with abnormal levels of both Aβ42 and P-tau were grouped under A+T+. Fibrinogen was higher in the A+ subgroup compared to that in the A- subgroup (p = 0.026). Fibrinogen was higher in the A+T+ subgroup compared to that in the A-T- subgroup (p = 0.011). Higher fibrinogen was associated with worse cognition and Aβ pathology (all p < 0.05). Additionally, the associations between fibrinogen and cognition were partially mediated by Aβ pathology (mediation proportion range 8%-28%). Interaction analyses and subgroup analyses showed that age and ApoE ε4 affect the relationships between fibrinogen and Aβ pathology. Fibrinogen was associated with both cognition and Aβ pathology. Aβ pathology may be a critical mediator for impacts of fibrinogen on cognition.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; cognitive impairment; plasma fibrinogen,,"Ma, LY; Song, JH; Gao, PY; Ou, YN; Fu, Y; Huang, LY; Wang, ZT; Zhang, DD; Cui, RP; Mi, YC; Tan, L"

Delivering synaptic protein mRNAs via extracellular vesicles ameliorates cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Synaptic dysfunction with reduced synaptic protein levels is a core feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptic proteins play a central role in memory processing, learning, and AD pathogenesis. Evidence suggests that synaptic proteins in plasma neuronal-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are reduced in patients with AD. However, it remains unclear whether levels of synaptic proteins in EVs are associated with hippocampal atrophy of AD and whether upregulating the expression of these synaptic proteins has a beneficial effect on AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Extracellular vesicles; Growth-associated protein 43; Messenger RNAs; Synaptic dysfunction; Synaptosome-associated protein 25,Humans; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Synaptotagmin I; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neurogranin; Cognitive Dysfunction; Extracellular Vesicles; Atrophy; Biomarkers,"Cai, H; Pang, Y; Ren, Z; Fu, X; Jia, L"
Connecting dementia risk loci to the CSF proteome identifies pathophysiological leads for dementia.,"Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified many genetic risk loci for dementia, but exact biological mechanisms through which genetic risk factors contribute to dementia remains unclear. Integrating CSF proteomic data with dementia risk loci could reveal intermediate molecular pathways connecting genetic variance to the development of dementia. We tested to what extent effects of known dementia risk loci can be observed in CSF levels of 665 proteins (proximity extension-based (PEA) immunoassays) in a deeply-phenotyped mixed-memory clinic cohort (n=502, mean age (sd) = 64.1 [8.7] years, 181 female [35.4%]), including patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=213), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=50) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n=93), and controls (n=146). Validation was assessed in independent cohorts (n=99 PEA platform, n=198, MRM-targeted mass spectroscopy and multiplex assay). We performed additional analyses stratified according to diagnostic status (AD, DLB, FTD and controls separately), to explore whether associations between CSF proteins and genetic variants were specific to disease or not. We identified four AD risk loci as protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL): CR1-CR2 (rs3818361, P=1.65e-08), ZCWPW1-PILRB (rs1476679, P=2.73e-32), CTSH-CTSH (rs3784539, P=2.88e-24) and HESX1-RETN (rs186108507, P=8.39e-08), of which the first three pQTLs showed direct replication in the independent cohorts. We identified one AD-specific association between a rare genetic variant of TREM2 and CSF IL6 levels (rs75932628, P = 3.90e-7). DLB risk locus GBA showed positive trans effects on seven inter-related CSF levels in DLB patients only. No pQTLs were identified for frontotemporal dementia, either for the total sample as for analyses performed within FTD only. pQTL variants were involved in the immune system, highlighting the importance of this system in the pathophysiology of dementia. We further identified pQTLs in stratified analyses for AD and DLB, hinting at disease-specific pQTLs in dementia.

Alzheimer's disease progression detection based on optical fluence rate measurements using alternative laser wavelengths.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) levels have increased globally, which is considered the sixth reason for deaths. So, a requirement exists for economic and quantitative methods to follow up the gradual progression of AD. The current study presents a simulation for a non-irradiated, safe, wearable, and noninvasive mobile approach for detecting the progression of Alzheimer's brain atrophy using the optical diffusion technique and for investigating the difference between the normal and the diseased brain. The virtual study was accomplished using COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulated head is implemented as the following: scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and white matter. The optical properties of the heterogeneous tissue are observed using the fluence rate after irradiating the head with different wavelengths (630, 700, 810, 915, and 1000 nm) of lasers. Two assessment techniques were applied to evaluate the brain atrophy measurements; the first technique was an array of photodetectors, which were lined at the head posterior, while a matrix of photodetectors was applied over the head surface in the second technique. The results show that the surface photodetectors approach differentiates the normal from AD brains without measuring the brain atrophy percentages by applying 630 nm. The array of photodetectors distinguishes normal from AD brains without detecting the brain atrophy percentages when the wavelengths 630, 700, and 810 nm were applied. The line detector at 1000 nm evaluates the brain atrophy percentages with AD. The future explores applying those techniques in vivo and analyzing the information by the spectrometer for extensively safer early detection of neural disorders.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; diffuse optical imaging; optical fluence rate; optical properties,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Disease Progression; Lasers; Brain; Atrophy; Gray Matter,"Mahdy, S; Abuelmakarem, HS"
Cryopreservation of cerebrospinal fluid cells preserves the transcriptional landscape for single-cell analysis.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) matrix biomarkers have become increasingly valuable surrogate markers of neuropsychiatric diseases in research and clinical practice. In contrast, CSF cells have been rarely investigated due to their relative scarcity and fragility, and lack of common collection and cryopreservation protocols, with limited exceptions for neurooncology and primary immune-based diseases like multiple sclerosis. the advent of a microfluidics-based multi-omics approach to studying individual cells has allowed for the study of cellular phenotyping, intracellular dynamics, and intercellular relationships that provide multidimensionality unable to be obtained through acellular fluid-phase analyses. challenges to cell-based research include site-to-site differences in handling, storage, and thawing methods, which can lead to inaccuracy and inter-assay variability. In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (10x Genomics) on fresh or previously cryopreserved human CSF samples from three alternative cryopreservation methods: Fetal Bovine Serum with Dimethyl sulfoxide (FBS/DMSO), FBS/DMSO after a DNase step (a step often included in epigenetic studies), and cryopreservation using commercially available Recovery© media. In comparing relative differences between fresh and cryopreserved samples, we found little effect of the cryopreservation method on being able to resolve donor-linked cell type proportions, markers of cellular stress, and overall gene expression at the single-cell level, whereas donor-specific differences were readily discernable. We further demonstrate the compatibility of fresh and cryopreserved CSF immune cell sequencing using biologically relevant sexually dimorphic gene expression differences by donor. Our findings support the utility and interchangeability of FBS/DMSO and Recovery cryopreservation with fresh sample analysis, providing a methodological grounding that will enable researchers to further expand our understanding of the CSF immune cell contributions to neurological and psychiatric disease.",2024,10x; Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Methods; Neuroimmunology; Omics; Single-cell; Transcriptomics,"Humans; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; Cryoprotective Agents; Cells, Cultured; Cryopreservation; Single-Cell Analysis; Cell Survival","Kodali, MC; Antone, J; Alsop, E; Jayakumar, R; Parikh, K; Chiot, A; Sanchez-Molina, P; Ajami, B; Arnold, SE; Jensen, K; Das, S; Weinberg, MS"

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) of the fornix is a candidate biomarker for early AD-related cognitive changes but is susceptible to bias due to partial volume averaging (PVA) with cerebrospinal fluid.

Chimeric antigen receptor macrophages target and resorb amyloid plaques.,"Substantial evidence suggests a role for immunotherapy in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the precise pathophysiology of AD is incompletely understood, clinical trials of antibodies targeting aggregated forms of β amyloid (Aβ) have shown that reducing amyloid plaques can mitigate cognitive decline in patients with early-stage AD. Here, we describe what we believe to be a novel approach to target and degrade amyloid plaques by genetically engineering macrophages to express an Aβ-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-Ms). When injected intrahippocampally, first-generation CAR-Ms have limited persistence and fail to significantly reduce plaque load, which led us to engineer next-generation CAR-Ms that secrete M-CSF and self-maintain without exogenous cytokines. Cytokine secreting ""reinforced CAR-Ms"" have greater survival in the brain niche and significantly reduce plaque load locally in vivo. These findings support CAR-Ms as a platform to rationally target, resorb, and degrade pathogenic material that accumulates with age, as exemplified by targeting Aβ in AD.",2024,Aging; Alzheimer disease; Immunotherapy; Macrophages; Therapeutics,"Mice; Animals; Humans; Receptors, Chimeric Antigen; Mice, Transgenic; Plaque, Amyloid; Alzheimer Disease; Cytokines; Macrophages","Kim, AB; Xiao, Q; Yan, P; Pan, Q; Pandey, G; Grathwohl, S; Gonzales, E; Xu, I; Cho, Y; Haecker, H; Epelman, S; Diwan, A; Lee, JM; DeSelm, CJ"
Missense mutation of angiotensin converting enzyme gene in an Alzheimer's disease patient: a case report.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of cognitive impairment in the elderly. In this report, we presented a case of a 52-year-old woman with rapid disease progression within 6 months. She was diagnosed with mild dementia according to the clinical symptoms and neuropsychological assessment results. Based on the results of neuropathological proteins in cerebrospinal fluid, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography, the patient showed the presence of β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau along with neurodegeneration [A+T+(N+)], indicative of AD. Whole exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous C-to-T missense mutation of nucleotide 3,755 (c.3755C > T) in exon 25 of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene on chromosome 17q23 (rs762056936).",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; angiotensin converting enzyme; early-onset; missense mutation; neuropsychiatric symptoms; rapid progression,,"He, M; Zhang, F; Qi, J; Zhang, W"
Disease staging of Alzheimer's disease using a CSF-based biomarker model.,"Biological staging of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may improve diagnostic and prognostic workup of dementia in clinical practice and the design of clinical trials. In this study, we used the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm to establish a robust biological staging model for AD using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Our analysis involved 426 participants from BioFINDER-2 and was validated in 222 participants from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center cohort. SuStaIn identified a singular biomarker sequence and revealed that five CSF biomarkers effectively constituted a reliable staging model (ordered: Aβ42/40, pT217/T217, pT205/T205, MTBR-tau243 and non-phosphorylated mid-region tau). The CSF stages (0-5) demonstrated a correlation with increased abnormalities in other AD-related biomarkers, such as Aβ-PET and tau-PET, and aligned with longitudinal biomarker changes reflective of AD progression. Higher CSF stages at baseline were associated with an elevated hazard ratio of clinical decline. This study highlights a common molecular pathway underlying AD pathophysiology across all patients, suggesting that a single CSF collection can accurately indicate the presence of AD pathologies and characterize the stage of disease progression. The proposed staging model has implications for enhancing diagnostic and prognostic assessments in both clinical practice and the design of clinical trials.",2024,,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Female; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Aged; Disease Progression; Peptide Fragments; Algorithms; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography,"Salvadó, G; Horie, K; Barthélemy, NR; Vogel, JW; Pichet Binette, A; Chen, CD; Aschenbrenner, AJ; Gordon, BA; Benzinger, TLS; Holtzman, DM; Morris, JC; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Janelidze, S; Ossenkoppele, R; Schindler, SE; Bateman, RJ; Hansson, O"
Detection of Glymphatic Outflow of Tau from Brain to Cerebrospinal Fluid in Mice.,"Glymphatic system denotes a brain-wide pathway that eliminates extracellular solutes from brain. It is driven by the flow of brain interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via perivascular spaces. Glymphatic convective flow is driven by cerebral arterial pulsation, which is facilitated by a water channel, aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expressed in astrocytic end-foot processes. Since its discovery, the glymphatic system receives a considerable scientific attention due to its pivotal role in clearing metabolic waste as well as neurotoxic substances such as amyloid b peptide. Tau is a microtubule binding protein, however it is also physiologically released into extracellular fluids. The presence of tau in the blood stream indicates that it is eventually cleared from the brain to the periphery, however, the detailed mechanisms that eliminate extracellular tau from the central nervous system remained to be elucidated. Recently, we and others have reported that extracellular tau is eliminated from the brain to CSF by an AQP4 dependent mechanism, suggesting the involvement of the glymphatic system. In this chapter, we describe the detailed protocol of how we can assess glymphatic outflow of tau protein from brain to CSF in mice.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Aquaporin-4; CSF; Extracellular tau; Glymphatic system; ISF; Tau protein,Mice; Animals; tau Proteins; Brain; Glymphatic System; Extracellular Fluid; Aquaporin 4; Cerebrospinal Fluid,"Ishida, K; Yamada, K"
A Method to Collect Cerebrospinal Fluid from Mouse Cisterna Magna to Determine Extracellular Tau Levels.,"Despite being a cytoplasmic protein abundant in neurons, tau is detectable in various extracellular fluids. In addition to being passively released from dying/degenerating neurons, tau is also actively released from living neurons in a neuronal activity-dependent mechanism. In vivo, tau released from neurons first appears in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) and subsequently drains into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by glymphatic system. Changes in CSF tau levels alter during the course of AD pathogenesis and are considered to predict the disease-progression of AD. A method to collect CSF from various mouse models of AD will serve as a valuable tool to investigate the dynamics of physiological/pathological tau released from neurons. In this chapter, we describe and characterize a method that reliably collects a relatively large volume of CSF from anesthetized mice.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; Extracellular tau; ISF; Tau protein,Mice; Animals; tau Proteins; Cisterna Magna; Brain; Extracellular Fluid; Glymphatic System; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Ishida, K; Yamada, K"

High Frequency of Autoantibodies in COVID-19 Patients with Central Nervous System Complications: a Multicenter Observational Study.,"We present a panel of central nervous system (CNS) complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their clinical characteristics.

In this retrospective multi-center study, we analyze neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 patients from Dec. 2022 to Feb. 2023 at four tertiary hospitals in China. CSF and/or serum in the enrolled patients were tested for autoantibodies using tissue-based assays (TBAs) and cell-based assays (CBAs). A total of 34 consecutive patients (median age was 40.5 years [range 15-83], 50% were female) were enrolled. CNS syndromes included encephalitis (n=15), encephalopathies (n=6), meningoencephalitis (n=3), ADEM (n=2), depression (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n=2), Parkinson disease (n=1), and central nervous system vasculitis (n=1). Twenty-eight specimens (of 44 tested; 11/27 [40.7%] CSF, 13/17 [76.5%] serums) were confirmed by TBAs to be autoantibodies positive. However, only a few autoantibodies (1 with MOG and 1 with NMDAR) were detected by CBAs assays. Twenty-four patients received immunotherapy. After a mean time of 7.26 months of follow-up, 75.8% (25/33) of patients had good outcome (mRS score ≤2). Although no significant difference was observed between the two groups, the proportion of positive CSF autoantibodies in the poor outcomes group was higher than that in the good outcomes group (57.1% vs 31.5%, P = 0.369). Autoantibodies were frequently observed in COVID-19-associated CNS complications.

"Comparison of cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and neuroimaging biomarker utility in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are crucial to understanding disease pathophysiology, aiding accurate diagnosis and identifying target treatments. Although the number of biomarkers continues to grow, the relative utility and uniqueness of each is poorly understood as prior work has typically calculated serial pairwise relationships on only a handful of markers at a time. The present study assessed the cross-sectional relationships among 27 Alzheimer's disease biomarkers simultaneously and determined their ability to predict meaningful clinical outcomes using machine learning. Data were obtained from 527 community-dwelling volunteers enrolled in studies at the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in St Louis. We used hierarchical clustering to group 27 imaging, CSF and plasma measures of amyloid beta, tau [phosphorylated tau (p-tau), total tau t-tau)], neuronal injury and inflammation drawn from MRI, PET, mass-spectrometry assays and immunoassays. Neuropsychological and genetic measures were also included. Random forest-based feature selection identified the strongest predictors of amyloid PET positivity across the entire cohort. Models also predicted cognitive impairment across the entire cohort and in amyloid PET-positive individuals.

"Introducing neurofilament light chain measure in psychiatry: current evidence, opportunities, and pitfalls.","The recent introduction of new-generation immunoassay methods allows the reliable quantification of structural brain markers in peripheral matrices. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a neuron-specific cytoskeletal component released in extracellular matrices after neuroaxonal impairment, is considered a promising blood marker of active brain pathology. Given its sensitivity to a wide range of neuropathological alterations, NfL has been suggested for the use in clinical practice as a highly sensitive, but unspecific tool to quantify active brain pathology. While large efforts have been put in characterizing its clinical profile in many neurological conditions, NfL has received far less attention as a potential biomarker in major psychiatric disorders. Therefore, we briefly introduce NfL as a marker of neuroaxonal injury, systematically review recent findings on cerebrospinal fluid and blood NfL levels in patients with primary psychiatric conditions and highlight the opportunities and pitfalls. Current evidence suggests an elevation of blood NfL levels in patients with major depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, anorexia nervosa, and substance use disorders compared to physiological states. However, blood NfL levels strongly vary across diagnostic entities, clinical stage, and patient subgroups, and are influenced by several demographic, clinical, and analytical factors, which require accurate characterization. Potential clinical applications of NfL measure in psychiatry are seen in diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, to exclude neurodegenerative disease, in the assessment of brain toxicity for different pharmacological compounds, and in the longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. The high inter-individual variability of NfL levels and the lack of neurobiological understanding of its release are some of the main current limitations. Overall, this primer aims to introduce researchers and clinicians to NfL measure in the psychiatric field and to provide a conceptual framework for future research directions.",2024,,,"Bavato, F; Barro, C; Schnider, LK; Simrén, J; Zetterberg, H; Seifritz, E; Quednow, BB"

Which neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers method is better in theranostic of Alzheimer's disease? An umbrella review.,"Biomarkers are measured to evaluate physiological and pathological processes as well as responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers can be classified as diagnostic, prognostic, predictor, clinical, and therapeutic. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple biomarkers have been reported so far. Nevertheless, finding a specific biomarker in AD remains a major challenge. Three databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were selected with the keywords of Alzheimer's disease, neuroimaging, biomarker, and blood. The results were finalized with 49 potential CSF/blood and 35 neuroimaging biomarkers.

Subtypes of brain change in aging and their associations with cognition and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"Structural brain changes underly cognitive changes in older age and contribute to inter-individual variability in cognition. Here, we assessed how changes in cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume, are related to cognitive change in cognitively unimpaired older adults using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data-driven clustering. Specifically, we tested (1) which brain structural changes over time predict cognitive change in older age (2) whether these are associated with core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-β (Aβ42), and (3) the degree of overlap between clusters derived from different structural features. In total 1899 cognitively healthy older adults (50 - 93 years) were followed up to 16 years with neuropsychological and structural MRI assessments, a subsample of which (n = 612) had CSF p-tau and Aβ42 measurements. We applied Monte-Carlo Reference-based Consensus clustering to identify subgroups of older adults based on structural brain change patterns over time. Four clusters for each brain feature were identified, representing the degree of longitudinal brain decline. Each brain feature provided a unique contribution to brain aging as clusters were largely independent across modalities. Cognitive change and baseline cognition were best predicted by cortical area change, whereas higher levels of p-tau and Aβ42 were associated with changes in subcortical volume. These results provide insights into the link between changes in brain morphology and cognition, which may translate to a better understanding of different aging trajectories.",2024,Ageotypes; CSF AD biomarkers; Cognitively unimpaired older adults; Longitudinal MRI; Memory,,"Capogna, E; Sørensen, Ø; Watne, LO; Roe, J; Strømstad, M; Idland, AV; Halaas, NB; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Walhovd, KB; Fjell, AM; Vidal-Piñeiro, D"
Evaluation of Exploratory Fluid Biomarker Results from a Phase 1 Senolytic Trial in Mild Alzheimer's Disease.,"Senescent cell accumulation contributes to the progression of age-related disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical trials evaluating senolytics, drugs that clear senescent cells, are underway, but lack standardized outcome measures. Our team recently published data from the first open-label trial to evaluate senolytics (dasatinib plus quercetin) in AD. After 12-weeks of intermittent treatment, we reported brain exposure to dasatinib, favorable safety and tolerability, and modest post-treatment changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory and AD biomarkers using commercially available assays. Herein, we present more comprehensive exploratory analyses of senolytic associated changes in AD relevant proteins, metabolites, lipids, and transcripts measured across blood, CSF, and urine. These analyses included mass spectrometry for precise quantification of amyloid beta (Aß) and tau in CSF; immunoassays to assess senescence associated secretory factors in plasma, CSF, and urine; mass spectrometry analysis of urinary metabolites and lipids in blood and CSF; and transcriptomic analyses relevant to chronic stress measured in peripheral blood cells. Levels of Aß and tau species remained stable. Targeted cytokine and chemokine analyses revealed treatment-associated increases in inflammatory plasma fractalkine and MMP-7 and CSF IL-6. Urinary metabolites remained unchanged. Modest treatment-associated lipid profile changes suggestive of decreased inflammation were observed both peripherally and centrally.

Molecular Signatures of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus: A Largescale Proteomic Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid.,"Given the persistent challenge of differentiating idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH) from similar clinical entities, we conducted an in-depth proteomic study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 28 shunt-responsive iNPH patients, 38 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease, and 49 healthy controls. Utilizing the Olink Explore 3072 panel, we identified distinct proteomic profiles in iNPH that highlight significant downregulation of synaptic markers and cell-cell adhesion proteins. Alongside vimentin and inflammatory markers upregulation, these results suggest ependymal layer and transependymal flow dysfunction. Moreover, downregulation of multiple proteins associated with congenital hydrocephalus (e.g., L1CAM, PCDH9, ISLR2, ADAMTSL2, and B4GAT1) points to a possible shared molecular foundation between congenital hydrocephalus and iNPH. Through orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), a panel comprising 13 proteins has been identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers of iNPH, pending external validation. These findings offer novel insights into the pathophysiology of iNPH, with implications for improved diagnosis.",2024,,,"Kamalian, A; Barough, SS; Ho, SG; Albert, M; Luciano, MG; Yasar, S; Moghekar, A"

CO,"Vascular pathology is the second leading cause of cognitive impairment and represents a major contributing factor in mixed dementia. However, biomarkers for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are under-developed. Here we aimed to investigate the potential role of CO2 Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR) measured with phase-contrast quantitative flow MRI in cognitive impairment and dementia. Forty-five (69 ± 7 years) impaired (37 mild-cognitive-impairment and 8 mild-dementia by syndromic diagnosis) and 22 cognitively-healthy-control (HC) participants were recruited and scanned on a 3 T MRI. Biomarkers of AD pathology were measured in cerebrospinal fluid. We found that CBF-CVR was lower (p = 0.027) in the impaired (mean±SE, 3.70 ± 0.15%/mmHg) relative to HC (4.28 ± 0.21%/mmHg). After adjusting for AD pathological markers (Aβ42/40, total tau, and Aβ42/p-tau181), higher CBF-CVR was associated with better cognitive performance, including Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA (p = 0.001), composite cognitive score (p = 0.047), and language (p = 0.004). Higher CBF-CVR was also associated with better physical function, including gait-speed (p = 0.006) and time for five chair-stands (p = 0.049).

Effects of Cerebrospinal Fluids from Alzheimer and Non-Alzheimer Patients on Neurons-Astrocytes-Microglia Co-Culture.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid plaques, tau tangles, neuroinflammation, and synaptic/neuronal loss, the latter being the strongest correlating factor with memory and cognitive impairment. Through an in vitro study on a neurons-astrocytes-microglia (NAM) co-culture system, we analyzed the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from AD and non-AD patients (other neurodegenerative pathologies). Treatment with CSF from AD patients showed a loss of neurofilaments and spheroids, suggesting the presence of elements including CX3CL1 (soluble form), destabilizing the neurofilaments, cellular adhesion processes, and intercellular contacts. The NAM co-cultures were analyzed in immunofluorescence assays for several markers related to AD, such as through zymography, where the expression of proteolytic enzymes was quantified both in cell extracts and the co-cultures' conditioned medium (CM).

Loss of monomeric alpha-synuclein (synucleinopenia) and the origin of Parkinson's disease.,"These facts argue against the gain-of-function synucleinopathy hypothesis, which proposes that Lewy pathology causes Parkinson's disease: (1) most brains from people without neurological symptoms have multiple pathologies; (2) neither pathology type nor distribution correlate with disease severity or progression in Parkinson's disease; (3) aggregated α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies is not a space-occupying lesion but the insoluble fraction of its precursor, soluble monomeric α-synuclein; (4) pathology spread is passive, occurring by irreversible nucleation, not active replication; and (5) low cerebrospinal fluid α-synuclein levels predict brain atrophy and clinical disease progression. The transformation of α-synuclein into Lewy pathology may occur as a response to biological, toxic, or infectious stressors whose persistence perpetuates the nucleation process, depleting normal α-synuclein and eventually leading to Parkinson's symptoms from neuronal death.

We evaluated 30 participants, including demographics, memory scales, and CSF biomarkers. Twenty-eight CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau protein, and t-tau/Aβ42 ratio) were analyzed using the Meso Scale Discovery Platform (MSD). Associations between memory scales (MoCA, MMSE, CDR) and CSF markers were performed using Spearman rho correlation.

Protocol to measure apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD specks in human cerebrospinal fluid via imaging flow cytometry.,"Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a c-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) specks are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRDs) patients. Here, we present a flow cytometry protocol to quantify ASC specks. We describe steps for fluorescently labeling ASC specks using antibody technology, visualizing with imaging flow cytometry, and gating based on physical characteristics. CSF ASC specks levels positively correlate with phosphorylated tau (Thr181) and negatively correlate with amyloid β ratio (42/40), thus serving as a neuroinflammatory biomarker for diagnosing AD/ADRDs.

Circulating biomarkers of inflammaging and Alzheimer's disease to track age-related trajectories of dementia: Can we develop a clinically relevant composite combination?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a rapidly growing global concern due to a consistent rise of the prevalence of dementia which is mainly caused by the aging population worldwide. An early diagnosis of AD remains important as interventions are plausibly more effective when started at the earliest stages. Recent developments in clinical research have focused on the use of blood-based biomarkers for improve diagnosis/prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD. Unlike invasive cerebrospinal fluid tests, circulating biomarkers are less invasive and will become increasingly cheaper and simple to use in larger number of patients with mild symptoms or at risk of dementia. In addition to AD-specific markers, there is growing interest in biomarkers of inflammaging/neuro-inflammaging, an age-related chronic low-grade inflammatory condition increasingly recognized as one of the main risk factor for almost all age-related diseases, including AD. Several inflammatory markers have been associated with cognitive performance and AD development and progression. The presence of senescent cells, a key driver of inflammaging, has also been linked to AD pathogenesis, and senolytic therapy is emerging as a potential treatment strategy. Here, we describe blood-based biomarkers clinically relevant for AD diagnosis/prognosis and biomarkers of inflammaging associated with AD. Through a systematic review approach, we propose that a combination of circulating neurodegeneration and inflammatory biomarkers may contribute to improving early diagnosis and prognosis, as well as providing valuable insights into the trajectory of cognitive decline and dementia in the aging population.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Blood biomarkers; Dementia; Inflammaging biomarkers,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aging; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Abbatecola, AM; Giuliani, A; Biscetti, L; Scisciola, L; Battista, P; Barbieri, M; Sabbatinelli, J; Olivieri, F"
High-dimensional generalized median adaptive lasso with application to omics data.,"Recently, there has been a growing interest in variable selection for causal inference within the context of high-dimensional data. However, when the outcome exhibits a skewed distribution, ensuring the accuracy of variable selection and causal effect estimation might be challenging. Here, we introduce the generalized median adaptive lasso (GMAL) for covariate selection to achieve an accurate estimation of causal effect even when the outcome follows skewed distributions. A distinctive feature of our proposed method is that we utilize a linear median regression model for constructing penalty weights, thereby maintaining the accuracy of variable selection and causal effect estimation even when the outcome presents extremely skewed distributions. Simulation results showed that our proposed method performs comparably to existing methods in variable selection when the outcome follows a symmetric distribution. Besides, the proposed method exhibited obvious superiority over the existing methods when the outcome follows a skewed distribution. Meanwhile, our proposed method consistently outperformed the existing methods in causal estimation, as indicated by smaller root-mean-square error. We also utilized the GMAL method on a deoxyribonucleic acid methylation dataset from the Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuroimaging initiative database to investigate the association between cerebrospinal fluid tau protein levels and the severity of AD.",2024,causal inference; observational studies; propensity score; variable selection,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Computer Simulation; Databases, Factual; Linear Models; Protein Processing, Post-Translational","Liu, Y; Gao, Q; Wei, K; Huang, C; Wang, C; Yu, Y; Qin, G; Wang, T"

Functional aspects of the brain lymphatic drainage system in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.,"The phenomenon of an aging population is advancing at a precipitous rate. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two of the most common age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, both of which are primarily characterized by the accumulation of toxic proteins and the progressive demise of neuronal structures. Recent discoveries about the brain lymphatic drainage system have precipitated a growing body of investigations substantiating its novel roles, including the clearance of macromolecular waste and the trafficking of immune cells. Notably, aquaporin 4-mediated glymphatic transport, crucial for maintaining neural homeostasis, becomes disrupted during the aging process and is further compromised in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. Functional meningeal lymphatic vessels, which facilitate the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid into the deep cervical lymph nodes, are integral in bridging the central nervous system with peripheral immune responses. Dysfunction in these meningeal lymphatic vessels exacerbates pathological trajectory of the age-related neurodegenerative disease. This review explores modulatory influence of the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatic vessels on the aging brain and its associated neurodegenerative disorders. It also encapsulates the insights of potential mechanisms and prospects of the targeted non-pharmacological interventions.",2024,aging; glymphatic system; meningeal lymphatic vessels; neurodegenerative diseases; non-pharmacological therapies,,"Chen, Y; He, X; Cai, J; Li, Q"
Biomarker-based staging of Alzheimer disease: rationale and clinical applications.,"Disease staging, whereby the spatial extent and load of brain pathology are used to estimate the severity of Alzheimer disease (AD), is pivotal to the gold-standard neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Current in vivo diagnostic frameworks for AD are based on abnormal concentrations of amyloid-β and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid or on PET scans, and breakthroughs in molecular imaging have opened up the possibility of in vivo staging of AD. Focusing on the key principles of disease staging shared across several areas of medicine, this Review highlights the potential for in vivo staging of AD to transform our understanding of preclinical AD, refine enrolment criteria for trials of disease-modifying therapies and aid clinical decision-making in the era of anti-amyloid therapeutics. We provide a state-of-the-art review of recent biomarker-based AD staging systems and highlight their contributions to the understanding of the natural history of AD. Furthermore, we outline hypothetical frameworks to stage AD severity using more accessible fluid biomarkers. In addition, by applying amyloid PET-based staging to recently published anti-amyloid therapeutic trials, we highlight how biomarker-based disease staging frameworks could illustrate the numerous pathological changes that have already taken place in individuals with mildly symptomatic AD.

Blood-Based Biomarkers for Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in Real-World Settings.,"As our knowledge about the biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) expands and we recognize the significance of early intervention for effective treatment, there is a shift in focus toward detecting the disease at an early stage. AD is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau proteins in the brain, leading to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While a definitive diagnosis of AD can only be confirmed through autopsy by examining these pathological features, there are now reliable methods available for diagnosing the disease in living individuals. These methods involve analyzing cerebrospinal fluid and using positron emission tomography to accurately assess the presence of Aβ and tau proteins. While these diagnostic markers have shown high accuracy in memory-clinic populations, they do have limitations such as the requirement for invasive lumbar puncture or exposure to ionizing radiation. Additionally, they are not easily accessible outside of specialized healthcare settings. Blood-based biomarkers of the core pathological features of AD are being developed, showing promise for less invasive, scalable identification of AD cases in the community. The advantages for the healthcare systems of this development are obvious, but the diagnostic performance of blood-based biomarkers in broader, non-selected populations outside of retrospective analyses and research cohorts still requires further investigation, including the combination with more effective neuropsychological assessments such as digital cognitive test solutions.",2024,Early and targeted treatment and prevention of neurodegeneration; Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; Patient and service user value; Scalable diagnostic technologies; Subjective cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Retrospective Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers,"Perneczky, R; Hansen, N; Hofmann, A; Laske, C; Priller, J; Grimmer, T; Frölich, L; Düzel, E; Jessen, F; Wiltfang, J"

Glypican-4 serum levels are associated with cognitive dysfunction and vascular risk factors in Parkinson's disease.,"Glypicans are biomarkers for various pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Increasing evidence suggests that glypicans also play a role in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Initially described as supporting functionality of synapses via glutamate receptors during CNS development, Glypican 4 (GPC-4) also plays a role in the context of dementia via tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease, which is also a co-pathology in Parkinson's disease dementia. However, clinical evidence of circulating GPC-4 in Parkinson's disease (PD) is missing so far. We therefore investigated GPC-4 in biofluids of PD patients. We analyzed GPC-4 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n = 140), serum (n = 80), and tear fluid samples (n = 70) of PD patients and control subjects in a similar age range by ELISA (serum, CSF) and western blot (tear fluid). Expression of circulating GPC-4 was confirmed in all three biofluids, with highest levels in serum. Interestingly, GPC-4 levels were age-dependent, and multiple regression analysis revealed a significant association between GPC-4 serum levels and MoCA score, suggesting an involvement of GPC-4 in PD-associated cognitive decline. Furthermore, stratification of PD patients for vascular risk factors revealed a significant increase of GPC-4 serum levels in PD patients with vascular risk factors. Our results suggest GPC-4 as a clinical biomarker for vascular risk stratification in order to identify PD patients with increased risk of developing dementia.",2024,Biomarker; Dementia; Glypican-4; Parkinson’s disease; Vascular risk factors,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Glypicans; Parkinson Disease; Risk Factors; tau Proteins,"Tatenhorst, L; Maass, F; Paul, H; Dambeck, V; Bähr, M; Dono, R; Lingor, P"

Exploring the significance of caspase-cleaved tau in tauopathies and as a complementary pathology to phospho-tau in Alzheimer's disease: implications for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting.,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that typically require postmortem examination for a definitive diagnosis. Detecting neurotoxic tau fragments in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum provides an opportunity for in vivo diagnosis and disease monitoring. Current assays primarily focus on total tau or phospho-tau, overlooking other post-translational modifications (PTMs). Caspase-cleaved tau is a significant component of AD neuropathological lesions, and experimental studies confirm the high neurotoxicity of these tau species. Recent evidence indicates that certain caspase-cleaved tau species, such as D13 and D402, are abundant in AD brain neurons and only show a modest degree of co-occurrence with phospho-tau, meaning caspase-truncated tau pathology is partially distinct and complementary to phospho-tau pathology. Furthermore, these caspase-cleaved tau species are nearly absent in 4-repeat tauopathies. In this review, we will discuss the significance of caspase-cleaved tau in the development of tauopathies, specifically emphasizing its role in AD. In addition, we will explore the potential of caspase-cleaved tau as a biomarker and the advantages for drug development targeting caspase-6.

Clinical symptoms of CTE range from mood and behavioral changes to cognitive impairment, depression, and suicidality. So far, CTE cannot be diagnosed in vivo and thus specific diagnostic parameters for CTE need to be found, to observe and treat exposed athletes as early as possible.

Multi-cohort cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identifies robust molecular signatures for asymptomatic and symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.,"Changes in Amyloid-β (A), hyperphosphorylated Tau (T) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) precedes AD symptoms, making CSF proteome a potential avenue to understand the pathophysiology and facilitate reliable diagnostics and therapies. Using the AT framework and a three-stage study design (discovery, replication, and meta-analysis), we identified 2,173 proteins dysregulated in AD, that were further validated in a third totally independent cohort. Machine learning was implemented to create and validate highly accurate and replicable (AUC>0.90) models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status. These models can also identify people that will convert to AD and those AD cases with faster progression. The associated proteins cluster in four different protein pseudo-trajectories groups spanning the AD continuum and were enrichment in specific pathways including neuronal death, apoptosis and tau phosphorylation (early stages), microglia dysregulation and endolysosomal dysfuncton(mid-stages), brain plasticity and longevity (mid-stages) and late microglia-neuron crosstalk (late stages).",2024,,,"Cruchaga, C; Ali, M; Shen, Y; Do, A; Wang, L; Western, D; Liu, M; Beric, A; Budde, J; Gentsch, J; Schindler, S; Morris, J; Holtzman, D; Fernández, M; Ruiz, A; Alvarez, I; Aguilar, M; Pastor, P; Rutledge, J; Oh, H; Wilson, E; Le Guen, Y; Khalid, R; Robins, C; Pulford, D; Ibanez, L; Wyss-Coray, T; Ju Sung, Y"
Odor identification score as an alternative method for early identification of amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.,"A simple screening test to identify the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is urgently needed. We investigated whether odor identification impairment can be used to differentiate between stages of the A/T/N classification (amyloid,  tau, neurodegeneration) in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or AD and in healthy controls. We collected data from 132 Japanese participants visiting the Toranomon Hospital dementia outpatient clinic. The odor identification scores correlated significantly with major neuropsychological scores, regardless of apolipoprotein E4 status, and with effective cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers [amyloid β 42 (Aβ42) and the Aβ42/40 and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau)/Aβ42 ratios] but not with ineffective biomarkers [Aβ40 and the p-Tau/total Tau ratio]. A weak positive correlation was observed between the corrected odor identification score (adjusted for age, sex, ApoE4 and MMSE), CSF Aβ42, and the Aβ42/40 ratio. The odor identification score demonstrated excellent discriminative power for the amyloidogenesis stage , according to the A/T/N classification, but was unsuitable for differentiating between the p-Tau accumulation and the neurodegeneration stages. After twelve odor species were analyzed, a version of the score comprising only four odors-India ink, wood, curry, and sweaty socks-proved highly effective in identifying AD amyloidogenesis, showing promise for the screening of preclinical AD.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Odorants; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Apolipoprotein E4; Peptide Fragments,"Igeta, Y; Hemmi, I; Yuyama, K; Ouchi, Y"
Beyond CSF and Neuroimaging Assessment: Evaluating Plasma miR-145-5p as a Potential Biomarker for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. New strategies for the early detection of MCI and sporadic AD are crucial for developing effective treatment options. Current techniques used for diagnosis of AD are invasive and/or expensive, so they are not suitable for population screening. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers such as amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) levels are core biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. Several studies have proposed the use of blood-circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential novel early biomarkers for AD. We therefore applied a novel approach to identify blood-circulating miRNAs associated with CSF biomarkers and explored the potential of these miRNAs as biomarkers of AD. In total, 112 subjects consisting of 28 dementia due to AD cases, 63 MCI due to AD cases, and 21 cognitively healthy controls were included. We identified seven Aβ1-42-associated plasma miRNAs, six P-tau181-associated plasma miRNAs, and nine Aβ1-42-associated serum miRNAs. These miRNAs were involved in AD-relevant biological processes, such as PI3K/AKT signaling. Based on this signaling pathway, we constructed an miRNA-gene target network, wherein miR-145-5p has been identified as a hub. Furthermore, we showed that miR-145-5p performs best in the prediction of both AD and MCI. Moreover, miR-145-5p also improved the prediction performance of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. The performance of this miRNA was validated using different datasets including an RT-qPCR dataset from plasma samples of 23 MCI cases and 30 age-matched controls. These findings indicate that blood-circulating miRNAs that are associated with CSF biomarkers levels and specifically plasma miR-145-5p alone or combined with the MMSE score can potentially be used as noninvasive biomarkers for AD or MCI screening in the general population, although studies in other AD cohorts are necessary for further validation.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; PI3K/AKT signaling; biomarkers; miR-145; microRNAs,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Cognitive Dysfunction; MicroRNAs; Biomarkers; Neuroimaging; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Wen, Q; Wittens, MMJ; Engelborghs, S; van Herwijnen, MHM; Tsamou, M; Roggen, E; Smeets, B; Krauskopf, J; Briedé, JJ"

Previous studies show that diminished levels of CSF amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) is a biomarker in AD; however, the role of serum Aβ42 in AD is contradictory. BMI and obesity have been reported to be related to increased serum Aβ42 levels. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relation between metabolic syndrome (MetS), its clinical measures (abdominal obesity, high glucose, high triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and hypertension), and serum Aβ42 levels.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); blood lipids; blood pressure; body mass index (BMI); metabolic syndrome; serum amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42),"Humans; Aged, 80 and over; Metabolic Syndrome; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Obesity; Alzheimer Disease; Triglycerides; Lipoproteins, HDL; Biomarkers; Glucose","Li, K; Zhou, X; Liu, Y; Li, D; Li, Y; Zhang, T; Fu, C; Li, L; Hu, Y; Jiang, L"

To investigate if the three p-tau variants are found to the same degree in different tau structures and if their co-localization is affected by the diagnosis and presence of Aß plaques, we immunostained sections of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) from non-demented controls (NC), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and primary age-related tauopathy (PART) against p-tau217, p-tau231, and p-tau205 together with Methoxi-X04. An analysis using confocal microscopy showed that the co-localization variable, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), was significantly higher between p-tau231 and p-tau205 in neurofibrillary tangles compared to neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites in plaques. The PCC value between all three p-tau variants in the neuropil threads was significantly lower in the ECs of patients with AD compared to the NC and in the ITGs of patients with AD, with a high Aß load compared to PART. The lowered value was associated with proportionally higher amounts of non-colocalized p-tau231 and p-tau217 compared to p-tau205, and the PCC values were negatively correlated with Aß and the tangle loads in patients with AD, but positively correlated with tangles in PART.

miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid associated with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and pathway analysis using a data mining and machine learning approach.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type and accounts for 60%-70% of the reported cases of dementia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in gene expression regulation. Although the diagnosis of AD is primarily clinical, several miRNAs have been associated with AD and considered as potential markers for diagnosis and progression of AD. We sought to match AD-related miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) found in the GeoDataSets, evaluated by machine learning, with miRNAs listed in a systematic review, and a pathway analysis. Using machine learning approaches, we identified most differentially expressed miRNAs in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which were validated by the systematic review, using the acronym PECO-Population (P): Patients with AD, Exposure (E): expression of miRNAs, Comparison (C): Healthy individuals, and Objective (O): miRNAs differentially expressed in CSF. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis was performed to identify the main pathways involving at least four miRNAs selected. Four miRNAs were identified for differentiating between patients with and without AD in machine learning combined to systematic review, and followed the pathways analysis: miRNA-30a-3p, miRNA-193a-5p, miRNA-143-3p, miRNA-145-5p. The pathways epidermal growth factor, MAPK, TGF-beta and ATM-dependent DNA damage response, were regulated by these miRNAs, but only the MAPK pathway presented higher relevance after a randomic pathway analysis.

Highly accurate blood test for Alzheimer's disease is similar or superior to clinical cerebrospinal fluid tests.,"With the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying therapies, identifying patients who could benefit from these treatments becomes critical. In this study, we evaluated whether a precise blood test could perform as well as established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Plasma %p-tau217 (ratio of phosporylated-tau217 to non-phosphorylated tau) was analyzed by mass spectrometry in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n = 1,422) and the US Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) cohort (n = 337). Matched CSF samples were analyzed with clinically used and FDA-approved automated immunoassays for Aβ42/40 and p-tau181/Aβ42. The primary and secondary outcomes were detection of brain Aβ or tau pathology, respectively, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the reference standard. Main analyses were focused on individuals with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia), which is the target population for available disease-modifying treatments. Plasma %p-tau217 was clinically equivalent to FDA-approved CSF tests in classifying Aβ PET status, with an area under the curve (AUC) for both between 0.95 and 0.97. Plasma %p-tau217 was generally superior to CSF tests in classification of tau-PET with AUCs of 0.95-0.98. In cognitively impaired subcohorts (BioFINDER-2: n = 720; Knight ADRC: n = 50), plasma %p-tau217 had an accuracy, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 89-90% for Aβ PET and 87-88% for tau PET status, which was clinically equivalent to CSF tests, further improving to 95% using a two-cutoffs approach.

Brain structural indicators of β-amyloid neuropathology.,"Recent efforts demonstrated the efficacy of identifying early-stage neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid assessment and positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer imaging. These methods are effective yet are invasive, expensive, and not widely accessible. We extend and improve the multiscale structural mapping (MSSM) procedure to develop structural indicators of β-amyloid neuropathology in preclinical AD, by capturing both macrostructural and microstructural properties throughout the cerebral cortex using a structural MRI. We find that the MSSM signal is regionally altered in clear positive and negative cases of preclinical amyloid pathology (N = 220) when cortical thickness alone or hippocampal volume is not. It exhibits widespread effects of amyloid positivity across the posterior temporal, parietal, and medial prefrontal cortex, surprisingly consistent with the typical pattern of amyloid deposition. The MSSM signal is significantly correlated with amyloid PET in almost half of the cortex, much of which overlaps with regions where beta-amyloid accumulates, suggesting it could provide a regional brain 'map' that is not available from systemic markers such as plasma markers.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta neuropathology; Gray matter to white matter contrast; MRI; Machine learning; PET,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Amyloid,"Jang, I; Li, B; Rashid, B; Jacoby, J; Huang, SY; Dickerson, BC; Salat, DH"

14-3-3 proteins-a moonlight protein complex with therapeutic potential in neurological disorder: in-depth review with Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of people worldwide and is a gradually worsening neurodegenerative condition. The accumulation of abnormal proteins, such as tau and beta-amyloid, in the brain is a hallmark of AD pathology. 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in AD pathology in several ways. One proposed mechanism is that 14-3-3 proteins interact with tau protein and modulate its phosphorylation, aggregation, and toxicity. Tau is a protein associated with microtubules, playing a role in maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal cytoskeleton. However, in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an abnormal increase in its phosphorylation occurs. This leads to the aggregation of tau into neurofibrillary tangles, which is a distinctive feature of this condition. Studies have shown that 14-3-3 proteins can bind to phosphorylated tau and regulate its function and stability. In addition, 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to interact with beta-amyloid (Aβ), the primary component of amyloid plaques in AD. 14-3-3 proteins can regulate the clearance of Aβ through the lysosomal degradation pathway by interacting with the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2A. Dysfunction of lysosomal degradation pathway is thought to contribute to the accumulation of Aβ in the brain and the progression of AD. Furthermore, 14-3-3 proteins have been found to be downregulated in the brains of AD patients, suggesting that their dysregulation may contribute to AD pathology. For example, decreased levels of 14-3-3 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid have been suggested as a biomarker for AD. Overall, these findings suggest that 14-3-3 proteins may play an important role in AD pathology and may represent a potential therapeutic target for the disease. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in AD and to explore their potential as a therapeutic target.",2024,14-3-3 protein; Alzheimer’s disease; mutations; phosphorylation binding grove; protein-protein interaction; tau protein,,"Abdi, G; Jain, M; Patil, N; Upadhyay, B; Vyas, N; Dwivedi, M; Kaushal, RS"

Genome-wide epistasis analysis reveals gene-gene interaction network on an intermediate endophenotype P-tau/Aβ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly worldwide. The exact etiology of AD, particularly its genetic mechanisms, remains incompletely understood. Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which primarily focus on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with main effects, provide limited explanations for the ""missing heritability"" of AD, while there is growing evidence supporting the important role of epistasis. In this study, we performed a genome-wide SNP-SNP interaction detection using a linear regression model and employed multiple GPUs for parallel computing, significantly enhancing the speed of whole-genome analysis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau (P-tau)/amyloid-[Formula: see text] (A[Formula: see text]) ratio was used as a quantitative trait (QT) to enhance statistical power. Age, gender, and clinical diagnosis were included as covariates to control for potential non-genetic factors influencing AD. We identified 961 pairs of statistically significant SNP-SNP interactions, explaining a high-level variance of P-tau/A[Formula: see text] level, all of which exhibited marginal main effects. Additionally, we replicated 432 previously reported AD-related genes and found 11 gene-gene interaction pairs overlapping with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Our findings may contribute to partially explain the ""missing heritability"" of AD.

A combinatorial approach for achieving CNS-selective RNAi.,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an endogenous process that can be harnessed using chemically modified small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to potently modulate gene expression in many tissues. The route of administration and chemical architecture are the primary drivers of oligonucleotide tissue distribution, including siRNAs. Independently of the nature and type, oligonucleotides are eliminated from the body through clearance tissues, where their unintended accumulation may result in undesired gene modulation. Divalent siRNAs (di-siRNAs) administered into the CSF induce robust gene silencing throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Upon clearance from the CSF, they are mainly filtered by the kidneys and liver, with the most functionally significant accumulation occurring in the liver. siRNA- and miRNA-induced silencing can be blocked through substrate inhibition using single-stranded, stabilized oligonucleotides called antagomirs or anti-siRNAs. Using APOE as a model target, we show that undesired di-siRNA-induced silencing in the liver can be mitigated through administration of liver targeting GalNAc-conjugated anti-siRNAs, without impacting CNS activity. Blocking unwanted hepatic APOE silencing achieves fully CNS-selective silencing, essential for potential clinical translation. While we focus on CNS/liver selectivity, coadministration of differentially targeting siRNA and anti-siRNAs can be adapted as a strategy to achieve tissue selectivity in different organ combinations.",2024,,"Animals; Humans; Male; Mice; Acetylgalactosamine; Antagomirs; Apolipoproteins E; Central Nervous System; Gene Silencing; Liver; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MicroRNAs; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering","Ferguson, CM; Godinho, BMDC; Echeverria, D; Hassler, M; Vangjeli, L; Sousa, J; McHugh, N; Alterman, J; Hariharan, V; Krishnamurthy, PM; Watts, J; Rogaev, E; Khvorova, A"
Fluid biomarkers in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a type of cerebrovascular disorder characterised by the accumulation of amyloid within the leptomeninges and small/medium-sized cerebral blood vessels. Typically, cerebral haemorrhages are one of the first clinical manifestations of CAA, posing a considerable challenge to the timely diagnosis of CAA as the bleedings only occur during the later disease stages. Fluid biomarkers may change prior to imaging biomarkers, and therefore, they could be the future of CAA diagnosis. Additionally, they can be used as primary outcome markers in prospective clinical trials. Among fluid biomarkers, blood-based biomarkers offer a distinct advantage over cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers as they do not require a procedure as invasive as a lumbar puncture. This article aimed to provide an overview of the present clinical data concerning fluid biomarkers associated with CAA and point out the direction of future studies. Among all the biomarkers discussed, amyloid β, neurofilament light chain, matrix metalloproteinases, complement 3, uric acid, and lactadherin demonstrated the most promising evidence. However, the field of fluid biomarkers for CAA is an under-researched area, and in most cases, there are only one or two studies on each of the biomarkers mentioned in this review. Additionally, a small sample size is a common limitation of the discussed studies. Hence, it is hard to reach a solid conclusion on the clinical significance of each biomarker at different stages of the disease or in various subpopulations of CAA. In order to overcome this issue, larger longitudinal and multicentered studies are needed.",2024,amyloid beta; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; differential diagnosis; familial cerebral amyloid angiopathy; fluid biomarkers; surrogate endpoints,,"Savar, SM; Ma, B; Hone, E; Jahan, F; Markovic, S; Pedrini, S; Shemehsavar, S; Easwaran, V; Taddei, K; Gardener, S; Chhatwal, JP; van Etten, ES; van Osch, MJP; Clarke, D; Gnjec, A; van Buchem, MA; Wermer, MJH; Hankey, GJ; Greenberg, SM; Martins, RN; Sohrabi, HR"

New horizons in the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's Disease in older adults.,"Alzheimer's Disease (ad) is the most common cause of dementia, and in addition to cognitive decline, it directly contributes to physical frailty, falls, incontinence, institutionalisation and polypharmacy in older adults. Increasing availability of clinically validated biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography to assess both amyloid and tau pathology has led to a reconceptualisation of ad as a clinical-biological diagnosis, rather than one based purely on clinical phenotype. However, co-pathology is frequent in older adults which influence the accuracy of biomarker interpretation. Importantly, some older adults with positive amyloid or tau pathological biomarkers may never experience cognitive impairment or dementia. These strides towards achieving an accurate clinical-biological diagnosis are occurring alongside recent positive phase 3 trial results reporting statistically significant effects of anti-amyloid Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs) on disease severity in early ad. However, the real-world clinical benefit of these DMTs is not clear and concerns remain regarding how trial results will translate to real-world clinical populations, potential adverse effects (including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities), which can be severe and healthcare systems readiness to afford and deliver potential DMTs to appropriate populations. Here, we review recent advances in both clinical-biological diagnostic classification and future treatment in older adults living with ad. Advocating for access to both more accurate clinical-biological diagnosis and potential DMTs must be done so in a holistic and gerontologically attuned fashion, with geriatricians advocating for enhanced multi-component and multi-disciplinary care for all older adults with ad.

Aging-Related Protein Alterations in the Brain.,"Aging is an intrinsic aspect of an organism's life cycle and is characterized by progressive physiological decline and increased susceptibility to mortality. Many age-associated disorders, including neurological disorders, are most commonly linked with the aging process, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of aging and AD on the molecular pathways and levels of different proteins in the brain, including metalloproteins, neurotrophic factors, amyloid proteins, and tau proteins. AD is caused by the aggregation of amyloid proteins in the brain. Factors such as metal ions, protein ligands, and the oligomerization state of amyloid precursor protein significantly influence the proteolytic processing of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP). Tau, a disordered cytosolic protein, serves as the principal microtubule-associated protein in mature neurons. AD patients exhibit decreased levels of nerve growth factor within their nervous systems and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, a significant increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor resulting from the neuroprotective effect of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor suggests that the synergistic action of these proteins plays a role in inhibiting neuronal degeneration and atrophy. The mechanism through which Aβ and AβPP govern Cu2+ transport and their influence on Cu2+ and other metal ion pools requires elucidation in future studies. A comprehensive understanding of the influence of aging and AD on molecular pathways and varying protein levels may hold the potential for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods for the treatment of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; apoptosis; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; neurotrophic factors; oxidative stress,Humans; Aging; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; tau Proteins,"Syed, RA; Hayat, M; Qaiser, H; Uzair, M; Al-Regaiey, K; Khallaf, R; Kaleem, I; Bashir, S"

However, their levels may be influenced by physiological parameters and comorbidities that should be considered before they can be used at the population level. For this purpose, we assessed the influences of different comorbidities on AD plasma markers in 208 cognitively unimpaired subjects. We analyzed both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 using the fully automated Lumipulse platform. The relationships between the different plasma markers and physiological variables were studied using linear regression models. The mean differences in plasma markers according to comorbidity groups were also studied. The glomerular filtration rate showed an influence on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The amyloid ratio was significantly lower in diabetic and hypertensive subjects, and the mean p-tau181 levels were higher in hypertensive subjects. The glomerular filtration rate may have an inverse relationship on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the amyloid ratio, suggesting that the latter is a more stable marker to use in the general population. Cardiovascular risk factors might have a long-term effect on the amyloid ratio and plasma levels of p-tau181.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; comorbidities; plasma biomarkers; presymptomatic stages; tau protein,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Comorbidity; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Martínez-Dubarbie, F; Guerra-Ruiz, A; López-García, S; Irure-Ventura, J; Lage, C; Fernández-Matarrubia, M; Pozueta-Cantudo, A; García-Martínez, M; Corrales-Pardo, A; Bravo, M; Martín-Arroyo, J; Infante, J; López-Hoyos, M; García-Unzueta, MT; Sánchez-Juan, P; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, E"
Inflammatory biomarkers for neurobehavioral dysregulation in former American football players: findings from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project.,"Traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) is defined as the clinical manifestation of the neuropathological entity chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). A core feature of TES is neurobehavioral dysregulation (NBD), a neuropsychiatric syndrome in repetitive head impact (RHI)-exposed individuals, characterized by a poor regulation of emotions/behavior. To discover biological correlates for NBD, we investigated the association between biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and NBD symptoms in former American football players and unexposed individuals.",2024,Biomarkers; CSF; Chronic traumatic encephalopathy; IL-6; Neurodegeneration; Neurofilament light chain protein; Neuroinflammation; Neuropsychiatric symptoms; Repetitive head impacts; Traumatic encephalopathy syndrome,"Humans; Aged; Middle Aged; Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy; Football; Interleukin-6; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Biomarkers","van Amerongen, S; Pulukuri, SV; Tuz-Zahra, F; Tripodis, Y; Cherry, JD; Bernick, C; Geda, YE; Wethe, JV; Katz, DI; Alosco, ML; Adler, CH; Balcer, LJ; Ashton, NJ; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Daneshvar, DH; Colasurdo, EA; Iliff, JJ; Li, G; Peskind, ER; Shenton, ME; Reiman, EM; Cummings, JL; Stern, RA"

Cortical folding correlates to aging and Alzheimer's Disease's cognitive and CSF biomarkers.,"This manuscript presents the quantification and correlation of three aspects of Alzheimer's Disease evolution, including structural, biochemical, and cognitive assessments. We aimed to test a novel structural biomarker for neurodegeneration based on a cortical folding model for mammals. Our central hypothesis is that the cortical folding variable, representative of axonal tension in white matter, is an optimal discriminator of pathological aging and correlates with altered loadings in Cerebrospinal Fluid samples and a decline in cognition and memory. We extracted morphological features from T1w 3T MRI acquisitions using FreeSurfer from 77 Healthy Controls (age = 66 ± 8.4, 69% females), 31 Mild Cognitive Impairment (age = 72 ± 4.8, 61% females), and 13 Alzheimer's Disease patients (age = 77 ± 6.1, 62% females) of recruited volunteers in Brazil to test its discriminative power using optimal cut-point analysis. Cortical folding distinguishes the groups with reasonable accuracy (Healthy Control-Alzheimer's Disease, accuracy = 0.82; Healthy Control-Mild Cognitive Impairment, accuracy = 0.56). Moreover, Cerebrospinal Fluid biomarkers (total Tau, A[Formula: see text]1-40, A[Formula: see text]1-42, and Lipoxin) and cognitive scores (Cognitive Index, Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test, Digit Span Backward) were correlated with the global neurodegeneration in MRI aiming to describe health, disease, and the transition between the two states using morphology.",2024,,"Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Aging; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins","de Moraes, FHP; Sudo, F; Carneiro Monteiro, M; de Melo, BRP; Mattos, P; Mota, B; Tovar-Moll, F"

Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor: An emerging target for neuroinflammation PET imaging and AD therapy.,"Although neuroinflammation is a significant pathogenic feature of many neurologic disorders, its precise function in-vivo is still not completely known. PET imaging enables the longitudinal examination, quantification, and tracking of different neuroinflammation biomarkers in living subjects. Particularly, PET imaging of Microglia, specialised dynamic immune cells crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis in central nervous system (CNS), is crucial for staging the neuroinflammation. Colony Stimulating Factor- 1 Receptor (CSF-1R) PET imaging is a novel method for the quantification of neuroinflammation. CSF-1R is mainly expressed on microglia, and neurodegenerative disorders greatly up-regulate its expression. The present review primarily focuses on the development, pros and cons of all the CSF-1R PET tracers reported for neuroinflammation imaging. Apart from neuroinflammation imaging, CSF-1R inhibitors are also reported for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a prevalent, advancing, and fatal neurodegenerative condition that have the characteristic feature of persistent neuroinflammation and primarily affects the elderly. The aetiology of AD is profoundly influenced by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and microglial dysfunction. Increasing evidence suggests that CSF-1R inhibitors (CSF-1Ri) can be helpful in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. This review article also summarises the most recent developments of CSF-1Ri-based therapy for AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF-1R; Microglia; Neurodegeneration; Neuroinflammation,"Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Colony-Stimulating Factors; Microglia; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Positron-Emission Tomography; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor","Adhikari, A; Chauhan, K; Adhikari, M; Tiwari, AK"
Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker panel for synaptic dysfunction in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.,"Synaptic dysfunction and degeneration is likely the key pathophysiology for the progression of cognitive decline in various dementia disorders. Synaptic status can be monitored by measuring synaptic proteins in CSF. In this study, both known and new synaptic proteins were investigated and compared as potential biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Seventeen synaptic proteins were quantified in CSF using two different targeted mass spectrometry assays in the prospective Swedish BioFINDER-2 study. The study included 958 individuals, characterized as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 205), AD dementia (n = 149) and a spectrum of other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 171), in addition to cognitively unimpaired individuals (CU, n = 443). Synaptic protein levels were compared between diagnostic groups and their associations with cognitive decline and key neuroimaging measures (amyloid-β-PET, tau-PET and cortical thickness) were assessed. Among the 17 synaptic proteins examined, 14 were specifically elevated in the AD continuum. SNAP-25, 14-3-3 zeta/delta, β-synuclein, and neurogranin exhibited the highest discriminatory accuracy in differentiating AD dementia from controls (areas under the curve = 0.81-0.93). SNAP-25 and 14-3-3 zeta/delta also had the strongest associations with tau-PET, amyloid-β-PET and cortical thickness at baseline and were associated with longitudinal changes in these imaging biomarkers [β(standard error, SE) = -0.056(0.0006) to 0.058(0.005), P < 0.0001]. SNAP-25 was the strongest predictor of progression to AD dementia in non-demented individuals (hazard ratio = 2.11). In contrast, neuronal pentraxins were decreased in all neurodegenerative diseases (except for Parkinson's disease), and NPTX2 showed the strongest associations with subsequent cognitive decline [longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination: β(SE) = 0.57(0.1), P ≤ 0.0001; and mPACC: β(SE) = 0.095(0.024), P ≤ 0.001] across the AD continuum. Interestingly, utilizing a ratio of the proteins that displayed higher levels in AD, such as SNAP-25 or 14-3-3 zeta/delta, over NPTX2 improved the biomarkers' associations with cognitive decline and brain atrophy. We found 14-3-3 zeta/delta and SNAP-25 to be especially promising as synaptic biomarkers of pathophysiological changes in AD. Neuronal pentraxins were identified as general indicators of neurodegeneration and associated with cognitive decline across various neurodegenerative dementias. Cognitive decline and brain atrophy were best predicted by ratios of SNAP-25/NPTX2 and 14-3-3 zeta/delta/NPTX2.",2024,biomarkers; cognition; mass spectrometry; synaptic pathology,"Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Biomarkers; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Middle Aged; Synapses; Aged, 80 and over; Prospective Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Positron-Emission Tomography; Neurogranin","Nilsson, J; Pichet Binette, A; Palmqvist, S; Brum, WS; Janelidze, S; Ashton, NJ; Spotorno, N; Stomrud, E; Gobom, J; Zetterberg, H; Brinkmalm, A; Blennow, K; Hansson, O"
A hybrid multimodal machine learning model for Detecting Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis utilizing single modality neuroimaging data has limitations. Multimodal fusion of complementary biomarkers may improve diagnostic performance. This study proposes a multimodal machine learning framework integrating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays for enhanced AD characterization. The model incorporates a hybrid algorithm combining enhanced Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm referred to as ILHHO, with Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) classifier for simultaneous feature selection and classification. ILHHO enhances HHO's search efficiency by integrating iterative mapping (IM) to improve population diversity and local escaping operator (LEO) to balance exploration-exploitation. Comparative analysis with other improved HHO algorithms, classic meta-heuristic algorithms (MHAs), and state-of-the-art MHAs on IEEE CEC2014 benchmark functions indicates that ILHHO achieves superior optimization performance compared to other comparative algorithms. The synergistic ILHHO-KELM model is evaluated on 202 AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects. Results demonstrate superior multimodal classification accuracy over single modalities, validating the importance of fusing heterogeneous biomarkers. MRI + PET + CSF achieves 99.2 % accuracy for AD vs. normal control (NC), outperforming conventional and proposed methods. Discriminative feature analysis provides further insights into differential AD-related neurodegeneration patterns detected by MRI and PET. The differential PET and MRI features demonstrate how the two modalities provide complementary biomarkers. The neuroanatomical relevance of selected features supports ILHHO-KELM's potential for extracting sensitive AD imaging signatures. Overall, the study showcases the advantages of capitalizing on complementary multimodal data through advanced feature learning techniques for improving AD diagnosis.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Harris hawks optimization; Kernel extreme learning machine; Machine learning; Multimodality,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Sheng, J; Zhang, Q; Zhang, Q; Wang, L; Yang, Z; Xin, Y; Wang, B"

Inorganic polyphosphate: from basic research to diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in ALS/FTD.,"Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is a simple, negatively charged biopolymer with chain lengths ranging from just a few to over a thousand ortho-phosphate (Pi) residues. polyP is detected in every cell type across all organisms in nature thus far analyzed. Despite its structural simplicity, polyP has been shown to play important roles in a remarkably broad spectrum of biological processes, including blood coagulation, bone mineralization and inflammation. Furthermore, polyP has been implicated in brain function and the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this review, we first address the challenges associated with identifying mammalian polyP metabolizing enzymes, such as Nudt3, and quantifying polyP levels in brain tissue, cultured neural cells and cerebrospinal fluid. Subsequently, we focus on recent studies that unveil how the excessive release of polyP by human and mouse ALS/FTD astrocytes contributes to these devastating diseases by inducing hyperexcitability, leading to motoneuron death. Potential implications of elevated polyP levels in ALS/FTD patients for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are explored. It is emphasized, however, that caution is required in targeting polyP in the brain due to its diverse physiological functions, serving as an energy source, a chelator for divalent cations and a scaffold for amyloidogenic proteins. Reducing polyP levels, especially in neurons, might thus have adverse effects in brain functioning. Finally, we discuss how activated mast cells and platelets also can significantly contribute to ALS progression, as they can massively release polyP.",2024,ALS; Nudt3; astrocytes; channels; motoneurons; polyP,Animals; Mice; Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Polyphosphates; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Mammals,"Garcés, P; Amaro, A; Montecino, M; van Zundert, B"

"Association between Alzheimer's disease, ","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease and there is still no definitive treatment today. Early diagnosis of the disease is important, but there are almost no biomarkers that can be used in early diagnosis. The cerebrospinal fluid used in the diagnosis of the disease is not sufficient and is very difficult to obtain. Therefore, blood biomarkers that are less costly, less invasive, easily accessible, and can be used in long-term studies would be a better alternative. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between Alzheimer's Disease and P301L MAPT gene mutation, homocysteine, folate and uric acid. 101 Alzheimer's patients and 101 healthy individuals were included in this study. Mutation analysis was performed using the Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method with blood samples taken from the subjects.

Assessment of immunoprecipitation with subsequent immunoassays for the blood-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"The Aβ42/40 ratio and the concentration of phosphorylated Tau181 in blood plasma represent attractive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. As a means for reducing potential matrix effects, which may interfere with plasma immunoassays, we have previously developed a pre-analytical sample workup by semi-automated immunoprecipitation. Here we test the compatibility of pre-analytical immunoprecipitations with automated Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and phosphorylated Tau181 immunoassays on the Lumipulse platform and compare the diagnostic performance of the respective immunoprecipitation immunoassay approaches with direct plasma measurements. 71 participants were dichotomized according to their Aβ42/40 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid into the diagnostic groups amyloid-positive (n = 32) and amyloid-negative (n = 39). The plasma Aβ1-42/1-40 ratio and phosphorylated Tau181 levels were determined on the Lumipulse G600II platform (Fujirebio) by direct measurements in EDTA-plasma or after Aβ- or Tau-immunoprecipitation, respectively. Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation of Aβ turned out to be compatible with the Lumipulse Aβ assays and resulted in a numerical, yet statistically not significant increase in the area under the ROC curve for plasma Aβ1-42/1-40. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the standardised effect size (Cohen's D). Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation of Tau resulted in increased differences between the diagnostic groups in terms of median and mean phosphorylated Tau 181 levels. Furthermore, we observed a greater Cohen's d (p < 0.001) and a larger area under the ROC curve (p = 0.038) after Tau-IP. Our preliminary findings in a small, preselected sample indicate that pre-analytical immunoprecipitation may have the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarker immunoassays for Aβ1-42/1-40 and phosphorylated Tau181 to predict brain amyloid deposition.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta; Biomarker; Blood plasma; Tau,,"Morgado, B; Klafki, HW; Bauer, C; Waniek, K; Esselmann, H; Wirths, O; Hansen, N; Lachmann, I; Osterloh, D; Schuchhardt, J; Wiltfang, J"

Consensus on rapid screening for prodromal Alzheimer's disease in China.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common cause of dementia, characterised by cerebral amyloid-β deposition, pathological tau and neurodegeneration. The prodromal stage of AD (pAD) refers to patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and evidence of AD's pathology. At this stage, disease-modifying interventions should be used to prevent the progression to dementia. Given the inherent heterogeneity of MCI, more specific biomarkers are needed to elucidate the underlying AD's pathology. Although the uses of cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography are widely accepted methods for detecting AD's pathology, their clinical applications are limited by their high costs and invasiveness, particularly in low-income areas in China. Therefore, to improve the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology through cost-effective screening methods, a panel of 45 neurologists, psychiatrists and gerontologists was invited to establish a formal consensus on the screening of pAD in China. The supportive evidence and grades of recommendations are based on a systematic literature review and focus group discussion. National meetings were held to allow participants to review, vote and provide their expert opinions to reach a consensus. A majority (two-thirds) decision was used for questions for which consensus could not be reached. Recommended screening methods are presented in this publication, including neuropsychological assessment, peripheral biomarkers and brain imaging. In addition, a general workflow for screening pAD in China is established, which will help clinicians identify individuals at high risk and determine therapeutic targets.",2024,Cognitive Dysfunction; Consensus; Neurocognitive Disorders; Neuropsychological Tests; Risk Assessment,,"Huang, L; Li, Q; Lu, Y; Pan, F; Cui, L; Wang, Y; Miao, Y; Chen, T; Li, Y; Wu, J; Chen, X; Jia, J; Guo, Q"

The Biochemistry Behind Cognitive Decline: Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. Pathologically, the disease is marked by neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are aberrant accumulations of the tau protein that develop inside neurons, and extracellular plaque deposits of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ). These pathological lesions are present in the brain before the beginning of clinical manifestations. However, despite advancements in the comprehension of AD pathophysiology, timely and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging.

Disentangling empathy impairment along Alzheimer's disease continuum: From subjective cognitive decline to Alzheimer's dementia.,"Little is known about empathy changes from the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continuum. The aim of this study is to investigate empathy across AD spectrum from Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD dementia (AD-d). Forty-five SCD, 83 MCI and 80 AD-d patients were included. Empathy was assessed by Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) (Perspective Taking - PT, Fantasy - FT, Empathic Concern - EC, and Personal Distress - PD), rated by caregivers before (T0) and after (T1) cognitive symptoms' onset. IRI was also administered to SCD patients to have a self-reported empathy evaluation. Facial emotion recognition was assessed by Ekman-60 Faces Test. Twenty-two SCD, 54 MCI and 62 AD-d patients underwent CSF biomarkers analysis and were classified as carriers of AD pathology (AP+) when they were A+/T+ (regardless of N), or non-carriers (AP-) when they were A- (regardless of T and N), or A+/T-/N-, or A+/T-/N+ according to the A/T(N) system. Cerebral FDG-PET SPM analysis was used to explore neural correlates underlying empathy deficits. PD scores significantly increased from T0 to T1 in SCD, MCI and AD-d (p < .001), while PT scores decreased in MCI and in AD-d (p < .001). SCD AP+ showed a greater increase in PD scores over time (ΔPD T0 - T1) than SCD AP- (p < .001). SCD self-reported PT scores were lower than those of general Italian population (14.94 ± 3.94, 95% C.I. [13.68-16.20] vs 17.70 ± 4.36, 95% C.I. [17.30-18.10]). In AD continuum (SCD AP+, MCI AP+, AD-d), a positive correlation was detected between PT-T1 and brain metabolism in left posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus and right frontal gyri; a negative correlation was found between ΔPT and brain metabolism in bilateral posterior cingulate gyri. PT may be subtly involved since the preclinical phase of AD. Changes over time of PD are influenced by the underlying Alzheimer's pathology and could potentially serve as an early AD neuropsychological marker.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Empathy; Mild cognitive impairment; Subjective cognitive decline,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Empathy; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Giacomucci, G; Moschini, V; Piazzesi, D; Padiglioni, S; Caruso, C; Nuti, C; Munarin, A; Mazzeo, S; Galdo, G; Polito, C; Emiliani, F; Frigerio, D; Morinelli, C; Bagnoli, S; Ingannato, A; Nacmias, B; Sorbi, S; Berti, V; Bessi, V"

KIBRA repairs synaptic plasticity and promotes resilience to tauopathy-related memory loss.,"Synaptic plasticity is obstructed by pathogenic tau in the brain, representing a key mechanism that underlies memory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Here, we found that reduced levels of the memory-associated protein KIdney/BRAin (KIBRA) in the brain and increased KIBRA protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with cognitive impairment and pathological tau levels in disease. We next defined a mechanism for plasticity repair in vulnerable neurons using the C-terminus of the KIBRA protein (CT-KIBRA). We showed that CT-KIBRA restored plasticity and memory in transgenic mice expressing pathogenic human tau; however, CT-KIBRA did not alter tau levels or prevent tau-induced synapse loss. Instead, we found that CT-KIBRA stabilized the protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) to maintain synaptic plasticity and memory despite tau-mediated pathogenesis. Thus, our results distinguished KIBRA both as a biomarker of synapse dysfunction and as the foundation for a synapse repair mechanism to reverse cognitive impairment in tauopathy.",2024,Alzheimer disease; Memory; Neuroscience; Synapses,"Mice; Animals; Humans; tau Proteins; Resilience, Psychological; Tauopathies; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Memory Disorders; Neuronal Plasticity; Mice, Transgenic; Kidney; Disease Models, Animal","Kauwe, G; Pareja-Navarro, KA; Yao, L; Chen, JH; Wong, I; Saloner, R; Cifuentes, H; Nana, AL; Shah, S; Li, Y; Le, D; Spina, S; Grinberg, LT; Seeley, WW; Kramer, JH; Sacktor, TC; Schilling, B; Gan, L; Casaletto, KB; Tracy, TE"
Application of blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice: Recommendations from Taiwan Dementia Society.,"Blood-based biomarkers (BBM) are potentially powerful tools that assist in the biological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo with minimal invasiveness, relatively low cost, and good accessibility. This review summarizes current evidence for using BBMs in AD, focusing on amyloid, tau, and biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Blood-based phosphorylated tau and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio showed consistent concordance with brain pathology measured by CSF or PET in the research setting. In addition, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are neurodegenerative biomarkers that show the potential to assist in the differential diagnosis of AD. Other pathology-specific biomarkers, such as α-synuclein and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), can potentially detect AD concurrent pathology. Based on current evidence, the working group from the Taiwan Dementia Society (TDS) achieved consensus recommendations on the appropriate use of BBMs for AD in clinical practice. BBMs may assist clinical diagnosis and prognosis in AD subjects with cognitive symptoms; however, the results should be interpreted by dementia specialists and combining biochemical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging information.

Mis-spliced transcripts generate de novo proteins in TDP-43-related ALS/FTD.,"Functional loss of TDP-43, an RNA binding protein genetically and pathologically linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), leads to the inclusion of cryptic exons in hundreds of transcripts during disease. Cryptic exons can promote the degradation of affected transcripts, deleteriously altering cellular function through loss-of-function mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNA transcripts harboring cryptic exons generated de novo proteins in TDP-43-depleted human iPSC-derived neurons in vitro, and de novo peptides were found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with ALS or FTD. Using coordinated transcriptomic and proteomic studies of TDP-43-depleted human iPSC-derived neurons, we identified 65 peptides that mapped to 12 cryptic exons. Cryptic exons identified in TDP-43-depleted human iPSC-derived neurons were predictive of cryptic exons expressed in postmortem brain tissue from patients with TDP-43 proteinopathy. These cryptic exons produced transcript variants that generated de novo proteins. We found that the inclusion of cryptic peptide sequences in proteins altered their interactions with other proteins, thereby likely altering their function. Last, we showed that 18 de novo peptides across 13 genes were present in CSF samples from patients with ALS/FTD spectrum disorders. The demonstration of cryptic exon translation suggests new mechanisms for ALS/FTD pathophysiology downstream of TDP-43 dysfunction and may provide a potential strategy to assay TDP-43 function in patient CSF.",2024,,Humans; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; DNA-Binding Proteins; Frontotemporal Dementia; Peptides; Proteomics,"Seddighi, S; Qi, YA; Brown, AL; Wilkins, OG; Bereda, C; Belair, C; Zhang, YJ; Prudencio, M; Keuss, MJ; Khandeshi, A; Pickles, S; Kargbo-Hill, SE; Hawrot, J; Ramos, DM; Yuan, H; Roberts, J; Sacramento, EK; Shah, SI; Nalls, MA; Colón-Mercado, JM; Reyes, JF; Ryan, VH; Nelson, MP; Cook, CN; Li, Z; Screven, L; Kwan, JY; Mehta, PR; Zanovello, M; Hallegger, M; Shantaraman, A; Ping, L; Koike, Y; Oskarsson, B; Staff, NP; Duong, DM; Ahmed, A; Secrier, M; Ule, J; Jacobson, S; Reich, DS; Rohrer, JD; Malaspina, A; Dickson, DW; Glass, JD; Ori, A; Seyfried, NT; Maragkakis, M; Petrucelli, L; Fratta, P; Ward, ME"
The role of ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) in Alzheimer's disease: A review of the mechanisms.,"The maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis is essential for central nervous system function. Consequently, factors that affect cholesterol homeostasis are linked to neurological disorders and pathologies. Among them, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) plays a significant role in atherosclerosis. However, its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. There is inconsistent information regarding ABCG1's role in AD. It can increase or decrease amyloid β (Aβ) levels in animals' brains. Clinical studies show that ABCG1 is involved in AD patients' impairment of cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Lower Aβ levels in the CSF are correlated with ABCG1-mediated CEC dysfunction. ABCG1 modulates α-, β-, and γ-secretase activities in the plasma membrane and may affect Aβ production in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM) cell compartment. Despite contradictory findings regarding ABCG1's role in AD, this review shows that ABCG1 has a role in Aβ generation via modulation of membrane secretases. It is, however, necessary to investigate the underlying mechanism(s). ABCG1 may also contribute to AD pathology through its role in apoptosis and oxidative stress. As a result, ABCG1 plays a role in AD and is a candidate for drug development.",2024,ABC transporters; ABCG1; Alzheimer's disease; Cholesterol; beta secretase,"Animals; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Brain; Cholesterol; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1","Yazdi, MK; Alavi, MS; Roohbakhsh, A"
Utility of cortical tissue analysis in normal pressure hydrocephalus.,"Clinical improvement following neurosurgical cerebrospinal fluid shunting for presumed idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is variable. Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients may have undetected Alzheimer's disease-related cortical pathology that confounds diagnosis and clinical outcomes. In this study, we sought to determine the utility of cortical tissue immuno-analysis in predicting shunting outcomes in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients. We performed a pooled analysis using a systematic review as well as analysis of a new, original patient cohort. Of the 2707 screened studies, 3 studies with a total of 229 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients were selected for inclusion in this meta-analysis alongside our original cohort. Pooled statistics of shunting outcomes for the 229 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients and our new cohort of 36 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients revealed that patients with Aβ + pathology were significantly more likely to exhibit shunt nonresponsiveness than patients with negative pathology. Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients with Alzheimer's disease -related cortical pathology may be at a higher risk of treatment facing unfavorable outcomes following cerebrospinal fluid shunting. Thus, cortical tissue analysis from living patients may be a useful diagnostic and prognostic adjunct for patients with presumed idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and potentially other neurodegenerative conditions affecting the cerebral cortex.",2024,Amyloid Beta; Biomarker; Dementia; Shunt Outcome; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure; Cerebral Cortex","Greenberg, ABW; Mekbib, KY; Mehta, NH; Kiziltug, E; Duy, PQ; Smith, HR; Junkkari, A; Leinonen, V; Hyman, BT; Chan, D; Curry, WT; Arnold, SE; Barker Ii, FG; Frosch, MP; Kahle, KT"

A pilot study to evaluate the effect of CT1812 treatment on synaptic density and other biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Effective, disease-modifying therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain a large unmet need. Extensive evidence suggests that amyloid beta (Aβ) is central to AD pathophysiology, and Aβ oligomers are among the most toxic forms of Aβ. CT1812 is a novel brain penetrant sigma-2 receptor ligand that interferes with the binding of Aβ oligomers to neurons. Preclinical studies of CT1812 have demonstrated its ability to displace Aβ oligomers from neurons, restore synapses in cell cultures, and improve cognitive measures in mouse models of AD. CT1812 was found to be generally safe and well tolerated in a placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and phase 1a/2 clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD.

A biological definition of neuronal α-synuclein disease: towards an integrated staging system for research.,"Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are currently defined by their clinical features, with α-synuclein pathology as the gold standard to establish the definitive diagnosis. We propose that, given biomarker advances enabling accurate detection of pathological α-synuclein (ie, misfolded and aggregated) in CSF using the seed amplification assay, it is time to redefine Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies as neuronal α-synuclein disease rather than as clinical syndromes. This major shift from a clinical to a biological definition of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies takes advantage of the availability of tools to assess the gold standard for diagnosis of neuronal α-synuclein (n-αsyn) in human beings during life. Neuronal α-synuclein disease is defined by the presence of pathological n-αsyn species detected in vivo (S; the first biological anchor) regardless of the presence of any specific clinical syndrome. On the basis of this definition, we propose that individuals with pathological n-αsyn aggregates are at risk for dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction (D; the second biological anchor). Our biological definition establishes a staging system, the neuronal α-synuclein disease integrated staging system (NSD-ISS), rooted in the biological anchors (S and D) and the degree of functional impairment caused by clinical signs or symptoms. Stages 0-1 occur without signs or symptoms and are defined by the presence of pathogenic variants in the SNCA gene (stage 0), S alone (stage 1A), or S and D (stage 1B). The presence of clinical manifestations marks the transition to stage 2 and beyond. Stage 2 is characterised by subtle signs or symptoms but without functional impairment. Stages 2B-6 require both S and D and stage-specific increases in functional impairment. A biological definition of neuronal α-synuclein disease and an NSD-ISS research framework are essential to enable interventional trials at early disease stages. The NSD-ISS will evolve to include the incorporation of data-driven definitions of stage-specific functional anchors and additional biomarkers as they emerge and are validated. Presently, the NSD-ISS is intended for research use only; its application in the clinical setting is premature and inappropriate.",2024,,Humans; alpha-Synuclein; Parkinson Disease; Lewy Body Disease; Synucleinopathies; Lewy Bodies; Syndrome,"Simuni, T; Chahine, LM; Poston, K; Brumm, M; Buracchio, T; Campbell, M; Chowdhury, S; Coffey, C; Concha-Marambio, L; Dam, T; DiBiaso, P; Foroud, T; Frasier, M; Gochanour, C; Jennings, D; Kieburtz, K; Kopil, CM; Merchant, K; Mollenhauer, B; Montine, T; Nudelman, K; Pagano, G; Seibyl, J; Sherer, T; Singleton, A; Stephenson, D; Stern, M; Soto, C; Tanner, CM; Tolosa, E; Weintraub, D; Xiao, Y; Siderowf, A; Dunn, B; Marek, K"

Integrated Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Reveals the Effects of Circadian Rhythm Disruption on the Metabolic Reprogramming of CD4+ T Cells in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Although growing evidence suggests close correlations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and circadian rhythm disruption (CRD), few studies have focused on the influence of circadian rhythm on levels of immune cells in AD. We aimed to delineate the mechanism underlying the effects of circadian related genes on T cell immune function in AD. A total of 112 brain samples were used to construct the CRD-related model by performing weighted gene co-expression network analysis and machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, and RF). The ssGSEA method was used to calculate the CRDscore in order to quantify CRD status. Using single-cell transcriptome data of CSF cells, we investigated the CD4+ T cell metabolism and cell-cell communication in high- and low-risk CRD groups. Connectivity map (CMap) was applied to explore small molecule drugs targeting CRD, and the expression of the signature gene GPR4 was further validated in AD. The CRDscore algorithm, which is based on 23 circadian-related genes, can effectively classify the CRD status in AD datasets. The single-cell analysis revealed that the CD4+ T cells with high CRDscore were characterized by hypometabolism. Cell communication analysis revealed that CD4+ T cells might be involved in promoting CD8+ T cell adhesion under CRD, which may facilitate T cell infiltration into the brain parenchyma. Overall, this study indicates the potential connotation of circadian rhythm in AD, providing insights into understanding T cell metabolic reprogramming under CRD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Circadian rhythm; Metabolic reprogramming; ScRNA-seq; T cell,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Single-Cell Analysis; Circadian Rhythm; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Gene Regulatory Networks; Male; Chronobiology Disorders; Brain; Metabolic Reprogramming","Weng, W; Fu, J; Cheng, F; Wang, Y; Zhang, J"

Virus-induced brain pathology and the neuroinflammation-inflammation continuum: the neurochemists view.,"Fascinatingly, an abundance of recent studies has subscribed to the importance of cytotoxic immune mechanisms that appear to increase the risk/trigger for many progressive neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Events associated with the neuroinflammatory cascades, such as ageing, immunologic dysfunction, and eventually disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the ""cytokine storm"", appear to be orchestrated mainly through the activation of microglial cells and communication with the neurons. The inflammatory processes prompt cellular protein dyshomeostasis. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease share a common feature marked by characteristic pathological hallmarks of abnormal neuronal protein accumulation. These Lewy bodies contain misfolded α-synuclein aggregates in PD or in the case of AD, they are Aβ deposits and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. Subsequently, these abnormal protein aggregates further elicit neurotoxic processes and events which contribute to the onset of neurodegeneration and to its progression including aggravation of neuroinflammation. However, there is a caveat for exclusively linking neuroinflammation with neurodegeneration, since it's highly unlikely that immune dysregulation is the only factor that contributes to the manifestation of many of these neurodegenerative disorders. It is unquestionably a complex interaction with other factors such as genetics, age, and environment. This endorses the ""multiple hit hypothesis"". Consequently, if the host has a genetic susceptibility coupled to an age-related weakened immune system, this makes them more susceptible to the virus/bacteria-related infection. This may trigger the onset of chronic cytotoxic neuroinflammatory processes leading to protein dyshomeostasis and accumulation, and finally, these events lead to neuronal destruction. Here, we differentiate ""neuroinflammation"" and ""inflammation"" with regard to the involvement of the blood-brain barrier, which seems to be intact in the case of neuroinflammation but defect in the case of inflammation. There is a neuroinflammation-inflammation continuum with regard to virus-induced brain affection. Therefore, we propose a staging of this process, which might be further developed by adding blood- and CSF parameters, their stage-dependent composition and stage-dependent severeness grade. If so, this might be suitable to optimise therapeutic strategies to fight brain neuroinflammation in its beginning and avoid inflammation at all.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cytotoxicity; Immunology; Inflammation; Microglia and neuroinflammation; Neurodegeneration; Parkinson’s disease; Viruses,,"Sian-Hulsmann, J; Riederer, P"
Differential diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's disease by Simoa p-tau181 measurements with matching plasma and CSF.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long preclinical phase. Although late-stage AD/dementia may be robustly differentiated from cognitively normal individuals by means of a clinical evaluation, PET imaging, and established biofluid biomarkers, disease differentiation between cognitively normal and various subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a challenging task. Differential biomarkers for early-stage AD diagnosis with accessible biofluid samples are urgently needed. Misfolded phosphorylated tau aggregates (p-tau) are present in multiple neurodegenerative diseases known as ""tauopathies"", with the most common being AD. P-tau181 is a well-established p-tau biomarker to differentiate AD dementia from non-AD pathology. However, it is unclear if p-tau181 is capable of diagnosing MCI, an early AD stage, from cognitively normal subjects, or if it can discriminate MCI subtypes amnestic MCI (aMCI) from non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). Here we evaluated the capability of p-tau181 in diagnosing MCI from cognitively normal subjects and discriminating aMCI from naMCI subtypes. We collected matching plasma and CSF samples of a clinically diagnosed cohort of 35 cognitively normal, 34 aMCI, 17 naMCI, and 31 AD dementia cases (total 117 participants) with supplemental CSF Aβ42 and total tau AD biomarker levels and performed Simoa p-tau181 assays. The diagnostic capabilities of Simoa p-tau181 assays to differentiate these cohorts were evaluated. We found (i) p-tau181 can robustly differentiate MCI or aMCI from cognitively normal cohorts with matching plasma and CSF samples, but such differentiation is weaker in diagnosing naMCI from cognitively normal groups, (ii) p-tau181 is not capable of differentiating aMCI from naMCI cohorts, and (iii) either factor of Aβ or total tau burden markedly improved differentiation power to diagnose aMCI from cognitively normal group. Plasma and CSF p-tau181 levels may serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosing aMCI from normal controls in the preclinical phase.

Proteomic Changes in the Human Cerebrovasculature in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Tauopathies Linked to Peripheral Biomarkers in Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid.,"Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Tandem mass tag labeling; amyloid; biomarkers; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; cerebrovasculature; mass spectrometry; progressive supranuclear palsy; tau,,"Wojtas, AM; Dammer, EB; Guo, Q; Ping, L; Shantaraman, A; Duong, DM; Yin, L; Fox, EJ; Seifar, F; Lee, EB; Johnson, ECB; Lah, JJ; Levey, AI; Levites, Y; Rangaraju, S; Golde, TE; Seyfried, NT"

Evaluation of SP3 for antibody-free quantification of tau in CSF mimic and brain by mass spectrometry.,"Tubulin-associated unit (tau) has an important role in the pathogenesis and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. In view of the diversity of tau proteoforms, antibody-free methods represent a good approach for unbiased quantification. We adapted and evaluated the single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample-preparation (SP3) protocol for antibody-free extraction of the tau protein in cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) mimic and in human brain. A total of 13 non-modified peptides were quantified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) after digestion of tau by trypsin. We significantly improved the basic SP3 protocol by carefully optimizing the organic solvents and incubation time for tau binding, as well as the digestion step for the release directly from the SP3 beads of the 13 tau peptides. These optimizations proved to be primarily beneficial for the most hydrophilic tau peptides, increasing the sequence coverage of recombinant tau. Mean recovery in CSF mimic of the 13 non-modified peptides was of 53%, with LODs ranging from 0.75 to 10 ng/mL. Next, we tested the optimized SP3 protocol on pathological tau extracted from the soluble fraction from an AD brain sample (middle frontal gyrus). We could successfully identify and quantify biologically relevant tau peptides including representative peptides of two isoforms and two phospho-peptides (pTau217 and pTau181).",2024,Alzheimer's disease; CSF; LC–HRMS; Quantitative proteomics; SP3; Tau protein; brain soluble fraction,Humans; Tubulin; Brain; Antibodies; Alzheimer Disease; Mass Spectrometry; Peptides,"Jacquemin, C; Villain, N; Azevedo, R; Boluda, S; Thévenot, EA; Fenaille, F; Lamari, F; Becher, F"
CSF Extracellular Vesicle Aβ42 and Tau/Aβ42 Ratio Are Associated with Cognitive Impairment in Older People with HIV.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent despite viral suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Given the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in age-related neurological disorders, we investigated soluble and EV-associated Aβ42, total Tau, NFL, GFAP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP in relation to cognitive impairment in PWH. Plasma and CSF EVs were isolated from 184 participants (98 PWH on ART and 86 HIV- controls). Biomarkers were measured using Meso Scale Discovery assays.

Blood-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease - moving towards a new era of diagnostics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a primary cause of dementia globally, is traditionally diagnosed via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures and positron emission tomography (PET). The invasiveness, cost, and limited accessibility of these methods have led to exploring blood-based biomarkers as a promising alternative for AD diagnosis and monitoring. Recent advancements in sensitive immunoassays have identified potential blood-based biomarkers, such as Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species. This paper briefly evaluates the clinical utility and reliability of these biomarkers across various AD stages, highlighting challenges like refining plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 assays and enhancing the precision of p-tau, particularly p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231. The discussion also covers other plasma biomarkers like neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and synaptic biomarkers, assessing their significance in AD diagnostics. The need for ongoing research and development of robust assays to match the performance of CSF and PET biomarkers is underscored. In summary, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly crucial in AD diagnosis, follow-up, prognostication, treatment response evaluation, and population screening, particularly in primary care settings. These developments are set to revolutionize AD diagnostics, offering earlier and more accessible detection and management options.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; amyloid; biomarker; blood; tau,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Positron-Emission Tomography,"Arslan, B; Zetterberg, H; Ashton, NJ"

Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: Are Olfactory Neuronal Precursors Useful for ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the main cause of dementia, affects millions of people around the world, whose diagnosis is based mainly on clinical criteria. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is obtained very late, when the neurodegenerative damage is significant for most patients. Therefore, the exhaustive study of biomarkers is indispensable for diagnostic, prognostic, and even follow-up support. AD is a multifactorial disease, and knowing its underlying pathological mechanisms is crucial to propose new and valuable biomarkers. In this review, we summarize some of the main biomarkers described in AD, which have been evaluated mainly by imaging studies in cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples. Furthermore, we describe and propose neuronal precursors derived from the olfactory neuroepithelium as a potential resource to evaluate some of the widely known biomarkers of AD and to gear toward searching for new biomarkers. These neuronal lineage cells, which can be obtained directly from patients through a non-invasive and outpatient procedure, display several characteristics that validate them as a surrogate model to study the central nervous system, allowing the analysis of AD pathophysiological processes. Moreover, the ease of obtaining and harvesting endows them as an accessible and powerful resource to evaluate biomarkers in clinical practice.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; olfactory neuroepithelium; olfactory neuronal precursors,,"Santillán-Morales, V; Rodriguez-Espinosa, N; Muñoz-Estrada, J; Alarcón-Elizalde, S; Acebes, Á; Benítez-King, G"

Age-Dependent and Aβ-Induced Dynamic Changes in the Subcellular Localization of HMGB1 in Neurons and Microglia in the Brains of an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"HMGB1 is a prototypical danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule that co-localizes with amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. HMGB1 levels are significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. However, the cellular and subcellular distribution of HMGB1 in relation to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease has not yet been studied in detail. Here, we investigated whether HMGB1 protein levels in brain tissue homogenates (frontal cortex and striatum) and sera from Tg-APP/PS1 mice, along with its cellular and subcellular localization in those regions, differed. Total HMGB1 levels were increased in the frontal cortices of aged wildtype (7.5 M) mice compared to young (3.5 M) mice, whereas total HMGB1 levels in the frontal cortices of Tg-APP/PS1 mice (7.5 M) were significantly lower than those in age-matched wildtype mice. In contrast, total serum HMGB1 levels were enhanced in aged wildtype (7.5 M) mice and Tg-APP/PS1 mice (7.5 M). Further analysis indicated that nuclear HMGB1 levels in the frontal cortices of Tg-APP/PS1 mice were significantly reduced compared to those in age-matched wildtype controls, and cytosolic HMGB1 levels were also significantly decreased. Triple-fluorescence immunohistochemical analysis indicated that HMGB1 appeared as a ring shape in the cytoplasm of most neurons and microglia in the frontal cortices of 9.5 M Tg-APP/PS1 mice, indicating that nuclear HMGB1 is reduced by aging and in Tg-APP/PS1 mice. Consistent with these observations, Aβ treatment of both primary cortical neuron and primary microglial cultures increased HMGB1 secretion in the media, in an Aβ-dose-dependent manner. Our results indicate that nuclear HMGB1 might be translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in both neurons and microglia in the brains of Tg-APP/PS1 mice, and that it may subsequently be secreted extracellularly.",2024,AD; Aβ; HMGB1; aging; frontal cortex,"Aged; Animals; Humans; Mice; Alarmins; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; HMGB1 Protein; Microglia; Neurons; Disease Models, Animal","Seol, SI; Davaanyam, D; Oh, SA; Lee, EH; Han, PL; Kim, SW; Lee, JK"
Template-controllable rolling circle amplification for dual protein sensitive analysis.,"Conjoint analysis of multiple protein biomarkers can improve the accuracy of disease analysis. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) generates different products by designing circular templates, which can subsequently bind with specific probes to generate various fluorescence signals; thus, it has potential for application in the analysis of various protein biomarkers. Current RCA approaches to detect proteins commonly follow an indirect primer-controlled RCA mode. And the molecular beacon probe combines with RCA products through free collision to generate signals, resulting in lower reaction efficiency. Herein, we propose a direct template-controlled RCA mode using nanosheets as carriers and quenchers for fluorescent probes to simultaneously detect two protein biomarkers. A dual functional magnetic bead was first designed to recognize and capture two proteins while releasing two templates for subsequent RCA. RCA products compete with probes loaded on two-dimensional metal-organic framework nanosheets for hybridization, completing the transition from single-stranded to double-stranded DNA. Double-stranded DNA is far from the nanosheets, and the recovered fluorescence signal can be used to evaluate the concentration of target proteins. This method exhibits excellent analytical performance and can successfully achieve the analysis of Tau and AβO in Alzheimer's disease clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples.",2024,,DNA; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Fluorescent Dyes; Biomarkers,"Wang, G; Tang, S; Dong, Y; Zou, F; Jiao, J; Xiang, Y"

Impact of Sleep Disorders and Disturbed Sleep on Brain Health: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,"Accumulating evidence supports a link between sleep disorders, disturbed sleep, and adverse brain health, ranging from stroke to subclinical cerebrovascular disease to cognitive outcomes, including the development of Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease-related dementias. Sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and other sleep disturbances, as well, some of which are also considered sleep disorders (eg, insomnia, sleep fragmentation, circadian rhythm disorders, and extreme sleep duration), have been associated with adverse brain health. Understanding the causal role of sleep disorders and disturbances in the development of adverse brain health is complicated by the common development of sleep disorders among individuals with neurodegenerative disease. In addition to the role of sleep disorders in stroke and cerebrovascular injury, mechanistic hypotheses linking sleep with brain health and biomarker data (blood-based, cerebrospinal fluid-based, and imaging) suggest direct links to Alzheimer disease-specific pathology. These potential mechanisms and the increasing understanding of the ""glymphatic system,"" and the recognition of the importance of sleep in poststroke recovery, as well, support a biological basis for the indirect (through the worsening of vascular disease) and direct (through specific effects on neuropathology) connections between sleep disorders and brain health. Given promising evidence for the benefits of treatment and prevention, sleep disorders and disturbances represent potential targets for early treatment that may improve brain health more broadly.

Alzheimer's disease early diagnostic and staging biomarkers revealed by large-scale cerebrospinal fluid and serum proteomic profiling.,"Amyloid-β, tau pathology, and biomarkers of neurodegeneration make up the core diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, these proteins represent only a fraction of the complex biological processes underlying AD, and individuals with other brain diseases in which AD pathology is a comorbidity also test positive for these diagnostic biomarkers. More AD-specific early diagnostic and disease staging biomarkers are needed. In this study, we performed tandem mass tag proteomic analysis of paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples in a discovery cohort comprising 98 participants. Candidate biomarkers were validated by parallel reaction monitoring-based targeted proteomic assays in an independent multicenter cohort comprising 288 participants. We quantified 3,238 CSF and 1,702 serum proteins in the discovery cohort, identifying 171 and 860 CSF proteins and 37 and 323 serum proteins as potential early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. In the validation cohort, 58 and 21 CSF proteins, as well as 12 and 18 serum proteins, were verified as early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. Separate 19-protein CSF and an 8-protein serum biomarker panels were built by machine learning to accurately classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD from normal cognition with areas under the curve of 0.984 and 0.881, respectively. The 19-protein CSF biomarker panel also effectively discriminated patients with MCI due to AD from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases.

Biochemical and histological studies have shown that overaccumulation of Aβ instigates an aberrant escalation in the phosphorylation and secretion of tau, a microtubule-binding axonal protein. The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau into intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles is in turn correlated with microglial dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis, culminating in synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. As neurodegeneration progresses, it gives rise to mild clinical symptoms of AD, which may eventually evolve into overt dementia. Synaptic loss in AD may develop even before tau alteration and in response to possible elevations in soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ associated with early AD. These findings largely rely on post-mortem autopsy examinations, which typically involve a limited number of patients. Over the past decade, a range of fluid biomarkers such as neurogranin, α-synuclein, visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), neuronal pentraxin 2, and β-synuclein, along with positron emission tomography (PET) markers like synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, have been developed. These advancements have facilitated the exploration of how synaptic markers in AD patients correlate with cognitive impairment. However, fluid biomarkers indicating synaptic loss have only been validated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), not in plasma, with the exception of VILIP-1.

Biomarkers for neurodegeneration impact cognitive function: a longitudinal 1-year case-control study of patients with bipolar disorder and healthy control individuals.,"Abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-amyloid-beta (Aβ)42, CSF-Aβ40, CSF-Aβ38, CSF-soluble amyloid precursor proteins α and β, CSF-total-tau, CSF-phosphorylated-tau, CSF-neurofilament light protein (NF-L), CSF-neurogranin, plasma-Aβ42, plasma-Aβ40, plasma-total-tau, plasma-NF-L and, serum-S100B during affective episodes may reflect brain changes that could impact cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The study aimed to investigate the association between these biomarkers indicative of Alzheimer's disease and those reflecting neurodegeneration alongside their impact on cognitive function in patients with BD and healthy control individuals (HC).

Association of amyloid-beta with depression or depressive symptoms in older adults without dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Several lines of evidence have indicated that depression might be a prodromal symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the cross-sectional association between amyloid-beta, one of the key pathologies defining AD, and depression or depressive symptoms in older adults without dementia. A systematic search in PubMed yielded 689 peer-reviewed articles. After full-text screening, nine CSF studies, 11 PET studies, and five plasma studies were included. No association between amyloid-beta and depression or depressive symptoms were found using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (0.15; 95% CI: -0.08; 0.37), positron emission topography (PET) (Cohen's d: 0.09; 95% CI: -0.05; 0.24), or plasma (-0.01; 95% CI: -0.23; 0.22). However, subgroup analyses revealed an association in plasma studies of individuals with cognitive impairment. A trend of an association was found in the studies using CSF and PET. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that depressive symptoms may be part of the prodromal stage of dementia.",2024,,Aged; Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Positron-Emission Tomography; tau Proteins,"Twait, EL; Wu, JH; Kamarioti, M; Basten, M; van der Flier, WM; Gerritsen, L; Geerlings, MI"

Prediction of clinical progression in nervous system diseases: plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intracellular type III intermediate filament protein, provides structural support and maintains the mechanical integrity of astrocytes. It is predominantly found in the astrocytes which are the most abundant subtypes of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. As a marker protein of astrocytes, GFAP may exert a variety of physiological effects in neurological diseases. For example, previous published literatures showed that autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, the studies of GFAP in brain tumors mainly focus on the predictive value of tumor volume. Furthermore, using biomarkers in the early setting will lead to a simplified and standardized way to estimate the poor outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ischemic stroke. Recently, observational studies revealed that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP, as a valuable potential diagnostic biomarker for neurosyphilis, had a sensitivity of 76.60% and specificity of 85.56%. The reason plasma GFAP could serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is that it effectively distinguished AD dementia from multiple neurodegenerative diseases and predicted the individual risk of AD progression. In addition, GFAP can be helpful in differentiating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) versus progressive MS (PMS). This review article aims to provide an overview of GFAP in the prediction of clinical progression in neuroinflammation, brain tumors, TBI, ischemic stroke, genetic disorders, neurodegeneration and other diseases in the CNS and to explore the potential therapeutic methods.",2024,Alexander disease; Alzheimer's disease; Astrocytes; Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; Down syndrome; GFAP; GFAP astrocytopathy; Gliomas; Ischemic stroke; Traumatic brain injury,Humans; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Intermediate Filaments; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Ischemic Stroke; Brain Neoplasms,"Zheng, X; Yang, J; Hou, Y; Shi, X; Liu, K"
Different inflammatory signatures based on CSF biomarkers relate to preserved or diminished brain structure and cognition.,"Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and both positive and negative associations of individual inflammation-related markers with brain structure and cognitive function have been described. We aimed to identify inflammatory signatures of CSF immune-related markers that relate to changes of brain structure and cognition across the clinical spectrum ranging from normal aging to AD. A panel of 16 inflammatory markers, Aβ42/40 and p-tau181 were measured in CSF at baseline in the DZNE DELCODE cohort (n = 295); a longitudinal observational study focusing on at-risk stages of AD. Volumetric maps of gray and white matter (GM/WM; n = 261) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs, n = 249) were derived from baseline MRIs. Cognitive decline (n = 204) and the rate of change in GM volume was measured in subjects with at least 3 visits (n = 175). A principal component analysis on the CSF markers revealed four inflammatory components (PCs). Of these, the first component PC1 (highly loading on sTyro3, sAXL, sTREM2, YKL-40, and C1q) was associated with older age and higher p-tau levels, but with less pathological Aβ when controlling for p-tau. PC2 (highly loading on CRP, IL-18, complement factor F/H and C4) was related to male gender, higher body mass index and greater vascular risk. PC1 levels, adjusted for AD markers, were related to higher GM and WM volumes, less WMHs, better baseline memory, and to slower atrophy rates in AD-related areas and less cognitive decline. In contrast, PC2 related to less GM and WM volumes and worse memory at baseline. Similar inflammatory signatures and associations were identified in the independent F.ACE cohort. Our data suggest that there are beneficial and detrimental signatures of inflammatory CSF biomarkers. While higher levels of TAM receptors (sTyro/sAXL) or sTREM2 might reflect a protective glia response to degeneration related to phagocytic clearance, other markers might rather reflect proinflammatory states that have detrimental impact on brain integrity.",2024,,Humans; Male; Female; Biomarkers; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Middle Aged; Brain; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognition; Inflammation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction; White Matter; tau Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Gray Matter; Cohort Studies,"Hayek, D; Ziegler, G; Kleineidam, L; Brosseron, F; Nemali, A; Vockert, N; Ravichandran, KA; Betts, MJ; Peters, O; Schneider, LS; Wang, X; Priller, J; Altenstein, S; Schneider, A; Fliessbach, K; Wiltfang, J; Bartels, C; Rostamzadeh, A; Glanz, W; Buerger, K; Janowitz, D; Perneczky, R; Rauchmann, BS; Teipel, S; Kilimann, I; Laske, C; Mengel, D; Synofzik, M; Munk, MH; Spottke, A; Roy, N; Roeske, S; Kuhn, E; Ramirez, A; Dobisch, L; Schmid, M; Berger, M; Wolfsgruber, S; Yakupov, R; Hetzer, S; Dechent, P; Ewers, M; Scheffler, K; Schott, BH; Schreiber, S; Orellana, A; de Rojas, I; Marquié, M; Boada, M; Sotolongo, O; González, PG; Puerta, R; Düzel, E; Jessen, F; Wagner, M; Ruiz, A; Heneka, MT; Maass, A"

Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics in patients with Alzheimer's disease reveals five molecular subtypes with distinct genetic risk profiles.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogenous at the molecular level. Understanding this heterogeneity is critical for AD drug development. Here we define AD molecular subtypes using mass spectrometry proteomics in cerebrospinal fluid, based on 1,058 proteins, with different levels in individuals with AD (n = 419) compared to controls (n = 187). These AD subtypes had alterations in protein levels that were associated with distinct molecular processes: subtype 1 was characterized by proteins related to neuronal hyperplasticity; subtype 2 by innate immune activation; subtype 3 by RNA dysregulation; subtype 4 by choroid plexus dysfunction; and subtype 5 by blood-brain barrier impairment. Each subtype was related to specific AD genetic risk variants, for example, subtype 1 was enriched with TREM2 R47H. Subtypes also differed in clinical outcomes, survival times and anatomical patterns of brain atrophy.

Micromotor-based electrochemical immunoassays for reliable determination of amyloid-β (1-42) in Alzheimer's diagnosed clinical samples.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), in addition to being the most common cause of dementia, is very difficult to diagnose, with the 42-amino acid form of Aβ (Aβ-42) being one of the main biomarkers used for this purpose. Despite the enormous efforts made in recent years, the technologies available to determine Aβ-42 in human samples require sophisticated instrumentation, present high complexity, are sample and time-consuming, and are costly, highlighting the urgent need not only to develop new tools to overcome these limitations but to provide an early detection and treatment window for AD, which is a top-challenge. In recent years, micromotor (MM) technology has proven to add a new dimension to clinical biosensing, enabling ultrasensitive detections in short times and microscale environments. To this end, here an electrochemical immunoassay based on polypyrrole (PPy)/nickel (Ni)/platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) MM is proposed in a pioneering manner for the determination of Aβ-42 in left prefrontal cortex brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma samples from patients with AD. MM combines the high binding capacity of their immunorecognition external layer with self-propulsion through the catalytic generation of oxygen bubbles in the internal layer due to decomposition of hydrogen peroxide as fuel, allowing rapid bio-detection (15 min) of Aβ-42 with excellent selectivity and sensitivity (LOD = 0.06 ng/mL). The application of this disruptive technology to the analysis of just 25 μL of the three types of clinical samples provides values concordant with the clinical values reported, thus confirming the potential of the MM approach to assist in the reliable, simple, fast, and affordable diagnosis of AD by determining Aβ-42.",2024,Alzheimer biomarkers; Brain tissue; Cerebrospinal fluid; Dementia's disease; Plasma; Screen printed electrodes,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Polymers; Metal Nanoparticles; Biosensing Techniques; Platinum; Pyrroles; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Immunoassay; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Gordón Pidal, JM; Moreno-Guzmán, M; Montero-Calle, A; Valverde, A; Pingarrón, JM; Campuzano, S; Calero, M; Barderas, R; López, MÁ; Escarpa, A"
CSF 14-3-3 zeta(ζ) isoform is associated with tau pathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"14-3-3 is a family of conserved proteins that consist of seven isoforms which are highly expressed in the brain, and 14-3-3 zeta(ζ) is one of the isoforms encoded by the YWHAZ gene. Previous studies demonstrated that 14-3-3ζ is deposited in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and that 14-3-3ζ interacts with tau from the purified neurofibrillary tangles of AD brain extract. The present study examined the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3ζ levels of 719 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including cognitively normal (CN) participants, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and patients with AD dementia, and aimed to identify whether CSF 14-3-3ζ is associated with tau pathology. CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were increased in AD, and particularly elevated among tau pathology positive individuals. CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were associated with CSF phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau) (r = 0.741, P < 0.001) and plasma p-tau (r = 0.293, P < 0.001), which are fluid biomarkers of tau pathology, and could predict tau pathology positive status with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.891). CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were also correlated to synaptic biomarker CSF GAP-43 (r = 0.609, P < 0.001) and neuroinflammatory biomarker CSF sTREM-2 (r = 0.507, P < 0.001). High CSF 14-3-3ζ levels at baseline were associated with progressive decline of cognitive function and neuroimaging findings during follow up. In conclusion, this study suggests that CSF 14-3-3ζ is a potential biomarker of AD that may be useful in clinical practice.",2024,14–3-3 zeta(ζ); Alzheimer's disease; CSF; Dementia; Tau pathology,Humans; 14-3-3 Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Protein Isoforms; tau Proteins,"Qiang, Q; Skudder-Hill, L; Toyota, T; Huang, Z; Wei, W; Adachi, H"
Patients with Neurodegenerative Proteinopathies Exhibit Altered Tryptophan Metabolism in the Serum and Cerebrospinal Fluid.,Some pathological conditions affecting the human body can also disrupt metabolic pathways and thus alter the overall metabolic profile. Knowledge of metabolic disturbances in specific diseases could thus enable the differential diagnosis of otherwise similar conditions. This work therefore aimed to comprehensively characterize changes in tryptophan metabolism in selected neurodegenerative diseases.

Single events were captured with mouse monoclonal antibodies to one of three different tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, or CD81) or with mouse (M) IgG control, and then probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies to prion protein (PrP) or CD47 to mark neuronal or presynaptic origin, as well as ADD- and PDD-related proteins: amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, α-synuclein, and Apolipoprotein (Apo) E. Data were collected only from captured events that were within the size range of 50 to 200 nm. Exosomes were present at approximately 100 billion per mL human CSF and were similarly abundant for CD9+ and CD81+ events, but CD63+ were only 22% to 25% of CD9+ (P<0.0001) or CD81+ (P<0.0001) events. Approximately 24% of CSF exosomes were PrP+, while only 2% were CD47+. The vast majority of exosomes were surface ApoE+, and the number of PrP-ApoE+ (P<0.001) and PrP+ApoE+ (P<0.01) exosomes were significantly reduced in ADD vs. HCN for CD9+ events only. Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein were not detected on the exosome surface or in permeabilized cargo. These data provide new insights into single exosome molecular features and highlight reduction in the CSF concentration of ApoE+ exosomes in patients with ADD.",2023,,,"Yakabi, K; Berson, E; Montine, KS; Bendall, SC; MacCoss, MJ; Poston, KL; Montine, TJ"

CSF p-tau205: a biomarker of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Post-mortem staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurofibrillary pathology is commonly performed by immunohistochemistry using AT8 antibody for phosphorylated tau (p-tau) at positions 202/205. Thus, quantification of p-tau205 and p-tau202 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be more reflective of neurofibrillary tangles in AD than other p-tau epitopes. We developed two novel Simoa immunoassays for CSF p-tau205 and p-tau202 and measured these phosphorylations in three independent cohorts encompassing the AD continuum, non-AD cases and cognitively unimpaired participants: a discovery cohort (n = 47), an unselected clinical cohort (n = 212) and a research cohort well-characterized by fluid and imaging biomarkers (n = 262). CSF p-tau205 increased progressively across the AD continuum, while CSF p-tau202 was increased only in AD and amyloid (Aβ) and tau pathology positive (A+T+) cases (P < 0.01).

Clinical evaluation of a novel plasma pTau217 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in Alzheimer's disease.,"A growing literature suggests that plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at amino acid 217 (pTau217) performs similarly to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and PET imaging to detect amyloid pathology and to provide diagnostic and prognostic information in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a significant limiting factor thus far has been a lack of widely available immunoassays. We evaluated a novel pTau217 S-PLEX® assay developed by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Rockville, MD) in plasma from 131 individuals with AD confirmed by CSF biomarkers and controls. Technical performance of the assay was excellent with an LLOQ of 1.84 pg/mL and intra/interplate CVs of 5.5% (0.3-15.0%) and 5.7% (range 0.3-13.4%), respectively. The pTau217 plasma assay differentiated AD and controls with an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.0) and pTau217 levels were 3.9-fold higher in individuals with AD. This performance was significantly better than what was observed for plasma pTau181, performed in parallel, and comparable to published data on existing pTau217 assays.

Elevated CSF angiopoietin-2 correlates with blood-brain barrier leakiness and markers of neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Breakdown of the neurovascular unit is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness contributing to cognitive decline and disease pathology in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular stability depends on angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT-1) signalling, antagonised by angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT-2) expressed upon endothelial injury. We examined the relationship between CSF ANGPT-2 and CSF markers of BBB leakiness and core AD biomarkers across three independent cohorts: (i) 31 AD patients and 33 healthy controls grouped according to their biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and Aβ42 < 550 pg/mL); (ii) 121 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research study (84 participants cognitively unimpaired (CU) enriched for a parental history of AD, 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 17 with AD); (iii) a neurologically normal cohort aged 23-78 years with paired CSF and serum samples. CSF ANGPT-2, sPDGFRβ, albumin and fibrinogen levels were measured by sandwich ELISA. In cohort (i), CSF ANGPT-2 was elevated in AD and correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau181 but not Aβ42. ANGPT-2 also correlated positively with CSF sPDGFRβ and fibrinogen - markers of pericyte injury and BBB leakiness. In cohort (ii), CSF ANGPT-2 was highest in MCI and correlated with CSF albumin in the CU and MCI cohorts but not in AD. CSF ANGPT-2 also correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau and with markers of neuronal injury (neurogranin and α-synuclein) and neuroinflammation (GFAP and YKL-40). In cohort (iii), CSF ANGPT-2 correlated strongly with the CSF/serum albumin ratio. Serum ANGPT-2 showed non-significant positive associations with CSF ANGPT-2 and the CSF/serum albumin ratio. Together, these data indicate that CSF and possibly serum ANGPT-2 is associated with BBB leakiness in early AD and is closely related to tau pathology and neuronal injury.

One Train May Hide Another: Two Cases of Co-Occurring Primary Familial Brain Calcification and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare disorder that can manifest with a wide spectrum of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms or even remain asymptomatic. Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common condition that typically starts as a progressive amnestic disorder and progresses to major cognitive impairment. Accurately attributing an etiology to cognitive impairment can sometimes be challenging, especially when multiple pathologies with potentially overlapping symptomatology contribute to the clinical phenotype. Here, we present the case of two patients with autosomal dominant PFBC and non-monogenic AD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis combined with genetic testing permitted the dual diagnosis. We emphasize the importance of thoroughly characterizing the patient's phenotype at onset and during the follow-up. Particular attention is placed on psychiatric symptoms given that both patients had a history of mood disorder, a frequent condition in the general population and in neurological diseases. We also discuss and challenge the paradigm of seeking a single diagnosis explaining all symptoms, remembering the possibility of a rare disease co-occurring with a common one.",2024,Alzheimer disease; Dementia; Double diagnosis; Neurogenetics; Neuropsychiatry; Primary familial brain calcification,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Genetic Testing; Phenotype; Rare Diseases; Brain,"Timmi, A; Morin, A; Guillin, O; Nicolas, G"

Proteo-genomics of soluble TREM2 in cerebrospinal fluid provides novel insights and identifies novel modulators for Alzheimer's disease.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) plays a critical role in microglial activation, survival, and apoptosis, as well as in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We previously reported the MS4A locus as a key modulator for soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To identify additional novel genetic modifiers of sTREM2, we performed the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) and identified four loci for CSF sTREM2 in 3,350 individuals of European ancestry. Through multi-ethnic fine mapping, we identified two independent missense variants (p.M178V in MS4A4A and p.A112T in MS4A6A) that drive the association in MS4A locus and showed an epistatic effect for sTREM2 levels and AD risk.

Elevated CSF GAP-43 is associated with accelerated tau accumulation and spread in Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta (Aβ) triggers the trans-synaptic spread of tau pathology, and aberrant synaptic activity has been shown to promote tau spreading. Aβ induces aberrant synaptic activity, manifesting in increases in the presynaptic growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), which is closely involved in synaptic activity and plasticity. We therefore tested whether Aβ-related GAP-43 increases, as a marker of synaptic changes, drive tau spreading in 93 patients across the aging and Alzheimer's spectrum with available CSF GAP-43, amyloid-PET and longitudinal tau-PET assessments. We found that (1) higher GAP-43 was associated with faster Aβ-related tau accumulation, specifically in brain regions connected closest to subject-specific tau epicenters and (2) that higher GAP-43 strengthened the association between Aβ and connectivity-associated tau spread. This suggests that GAP-43-related synaptic changes are linked to faster Aβ-related tau spread across connected regions and that synapses could be key targets for preventing tau spreading in Alzheimer's disease.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; GAP-43 Protein; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Positron-Emission Tomography; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Franzmeier, N; Dehsarvi, A; Steward, A; Biel, D; Dewenter, A; Roemer, SN; Wagner, F; Groß, M; Brendel, M; Moscoso, A; Arunachalam, P; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Ewers, M; Schöll, M"

Fluid and tissue biomarkers in Parkinson's disease: Immunodetection or seed amplification? Central or peripheral?,"Over the last two decades there have been meaningful developments on biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, extensively (but not solely) focusing on their proteinopathic nature. Accordingly, in Alzheimer's disease determination of levels of total and phosphorylated tau (τ and p-τ, usually p-τ181) along with amyloid-beta1-42 (Aβ1-42) by immunodetection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and currently even in peripheral blood, have been widely accepted and introduced to routine diagnosis. In the case of Parkinson's disease, α-synuclein as a potential biomarker (both for diagnosis and progression tracking) has proved more elusive under the immunodetection approach. In recent years, the emergence of the so-called seed amplification assays is proving to be a game-changer, with mounting evidence under different technical approaches and using a variety of biofluids or tissues, yielding promising diagnostic accuracies. Currently the least invasive but at once more reliable source of biosamples and techniques are being sought.

Resveratrol differentially affects MMP-9 release from neurons and glia; implications for therapeutic efficacy.,"Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol that activates sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), has been shown to reduce overall levels of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Depending on the site of release, however, MMP-9 has the potential to improve or impair cognition. In particular, its release from microglia or pericytes proximal to the blood brain barrier can damage the basement membrane, while neuronal activity-dependent release of this protease from glutamatergic neurons can instead promote dendritic spine expansion and long-term potentiation of synaptic plasticity. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that resveratrol reduces overall MMP-9 levels in CSF samples from patients with APOE4, an allele associated with increased glial inflammation. We also examine the possibility that resveratrol reduces inflammation-associated MMP release from cultured glia but spares neuronal activity-dependent release from cultured cortical neurons. We observe that resveratrol decreases overall levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in CSF samples from AD patients. Resveratrol also reduces CSF levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), glial-derived protein that restricts long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission, in individuals homozygous for APOE4. Consistent with these results, we observe that resveratrol reduces basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated MMP and TIMP-1 release from cultured microglia and astrocytes. In contrast, however, resveratrol does not inhibit release of MMP-9 from cortical neurons. Overall, these results are consistent with the possibility that while resveratrol reduces potentially maladaptive MMP and TIMP-1 release from activated glia, neuroplasticity-promoting MMP release from neurons is spared. In contrast, resveratrol reduces release of neurocan and brevican, extracellular matrix components that restrict neuroplasticity, from both neurons and glia. These data underscore the diversity of resveratrol's actions with respect to affected cell types and molecular targets and also suggest that further studies may be warranted to determine if its effects on glial MMP release could make it a useful adjunct for AD- and/or anti-amyloid therapy-related damage to the blood brain barrier.",2024,MMP ECM; PNN resveratrol neuron glia,,"Amontree, M; Nelson, M; Stefansson, L; Pak, D; Maguire-Zeiss, K; Turner, RS; Conant, K"

Subject Harmonization of Digital Biomarkers: Improved Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the early stage of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a crucial stage for therapeutic interventions and treatment. Early detection of MCI offers opportunities for early intervention and significantly benefits cohort enrichment for clinical trials. Imaging and in vivo markers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have high detection performance, yet their prohibitive costs and intrusiveness demand more affordable and accessible alternatives. The recent advances in digital biomarkers, especially language markers, have shown great potential, where variables informative to MCI are derived from linguistic and/or speech and later used for predictive modeling. A major challenge in modeling language markers comes from the variability of how each person speaks. As the cohort size for language studies is usually small due to extensive data collection efforts, the variability among persons makes language markers hard to generalize to unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel subject harmonization tool to address the issue of distributional differences in language markers across subjects, thus enhancing the generalization performance of machine learning models. Our empirical results show that machine learning models built on our harmonized features have improved prediction performance on unseen data.

Cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain mediates age-associated lower learning and memory in healthy adults.,"Multiple cognitive domains, including learning, memory, and psychomotor speed, show significant reductions with age. Likewise, several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurodegenerative biomarkers, including total tau (t-tau, a marker of neuronal body injury) and neurofilament light chain (NfL, a marker of axonal injury) show age-related increases in normal aging. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether the age-effect within different cognitive domains was mediated by age-associated CSF markers for neurodegenerative changes. We fitted 10 mediation models using structural equation modeling to investigate this in a cohort of 137 healthy adults, aged 40-80 years, from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation (DDI) study. Here, t-tau and NfL were defined as mediators between age and different cognitive tests. The models showed that NfL mediated the age-effect for CERAD learning and memory recall (learning: β = -0.395, p < 0.05; recall: β = -0.261, p < 0.01). No such effect was found in the other models.

CRISPR-Powered Aptasensor for Diagnostics of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides in the brain.

The aptasensor couples the high specificity of aptamers for Aβ biomarkers with CRISPR-Cas12a-based fluorescence detection. The CRISPR-powered aptasensor enables us to detect Aβ40 and Aβ42 in CSF samples within 60 min, achieving a detection sensitivity of 1 pg/mL and 0.1 pg/mL, respectively. To validate its clinical utility, we quantitatively detected Aβ40 and Aβ42 biomarkers in clinical CSF samples. Furthermore, by combining CSF Aβ42 levels with the c(Aβ42)/c(Aβ40) ratio, we achieved an accurate diagnostic classification of AD patients and healthy individuals, showing superior performance over the conventional ELISA method.

Impact of demographics and comorbid conditions on plasma biomarkers concentrations and their diagnostic accuracy in a memory clinic cohort.,"Plasma biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for identifying amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology. Before implementation in routine clinical practice, confounding factors modifying their concentration beyond neurodegenerative diseases should be identified. We studied the association of a comprehensive list of demographics, comorbidities, medication and laboratory parameters with plasma p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) on a prospective memory clinic cohort and studied their impact on diagnostic accuracy for discriminating CSF/amyloid PET-defined Aβ status. Three hundred sixty patients (mean age 66.5 years, 55% females, 53% Aβ positive) were included. Sex, age and Aβ status-adjusted models showed that only estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, standardized β -0.115 [-0.192 to -0.035], p = 0.005) was associated with p-tau181 levels, although with a much smaller effect than Aβ status (0.685 [0.607-0.763], p < 0.001). Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and eGFR significantly modified GFAP concentration. Age, blood volume (BV) and eGFR were associated with NfL levels. p-tau181 predicted Aβ status with 87% sensitivity and specificity with no relevant increase in diagnostic performance by adding any of the confounding factors.

Structural flexibility and heterogeneity of recombinant human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a promising biomarker for brain and spinal cord disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the differences in the reliability of GFAP measurements in different biological matrices. The reason for these discrepancies is poorly understood as our knowledge of the protein's 3-dimensional conformation, proteoforms, and aggregation remains limited. Here, we investigate the structural properties of GFAP under different conditions. For this, we characterized recombinant GFAP proteins from various suppliers and applied hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to provide a snapshot of the conformational dynamics of GFAP in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) compared to the phosphate buffer. Our findings indicate that recombinant GFAP exists in various conformational species. Furthermore, we show that GFAP dimers remained intact under denaturing conditions. HDX-MS experiments show an overall decrease in H-bonding and an increase in solvent accessibility of GFAP in aCSF compared to the phosphate buffer, with clear indications of mixed EX2 and EX1 kinetics. To understand possible structural interface regions and the evolutionary conservation profiles, we combined HDX-MS results with the predicted GFAP-dimer structure by AlphaFold-Multimer. We found that deprotected regions with high structural flexibility in aCSF overlap with predicted conserved dimeric 1B and 2B domain interfaces. Structural property predictions combined with the HDX data show an overall deprotection and signatures of aggregation in aCSF. We anticipate that the outcomes of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the structural flexibility of GFAP and ultimately shed light on its behavior in different biological matrices.",2024,CSF; GFAP; HDX‐MS; dementia biomarker; structural flexibility,Humans; Deuterium Exchange Measurement; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Phosphates; Protein Conformation; Reproducibility of Results; Recombinant Proteins,"Gogishvili, D; Illes-Toth, E; Harris, MJ; Hopley, C; Teunissen, CE; Abeln, S"

Bridging Retinal and Cerebral Neurodegeneration: A Focus on Crosslinks between Alzheimer-Perusini's Disease and Retinal Dystrophies.,"In the early stages of Alzheimer-Perusini's disease (AD), individuals often experience vision-related issues such as color vision impairment, reduced contrast sensitivity, and visual acuity problems. As the disease progresses, there is a connection with glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leading to retinal cell death. The retina's involvement suggests a link with the hippocampus, where most AD forms start. A thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) due to the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is seen as a potential AD diagnostic marker using electroretinography (ERG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Amyloid beta fragments (Aβ), found in the eye's vitreous and aqueous humor, are also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and accumulate in the retina. Aβ is known to cause tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to its buildup in various retinal layers. However, diseases like AD are now seen as mixed proteinopathies, with deposits of the prion protein (PrP) and α-synuclein found in affected brains and retinas. Glial cells, especially microglial cells, play a crucial role in these diseases, maintaining immunoproteostasis. Studies have shown similarities between retinal and brain microglia in terms of transcription factor expression and morphotypes. All these findings constitute a good start to achieving better comprehension of neurodegeneration in both the eye and the brain. New insights will be able to bring the scientific community closer to specific disease-modifying therapies.",2023,Alzheimer–Perusini; brain; eye; microglia; retinal dystrophies; rhodopsin,,"Donato, L; Mordà, D; Scimone, C; Alibrandi, S; D'Angelo, R; Sidoti, A"
Navigating the Complexities of Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES): Current State and Future Challenges.,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a unique neurodegenerative disease that is associated with repetitive head impacts (RHI) in both civilian and military settings. In 2014, the research criteria for the clinical manifestation of CTE, traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES), were proposed to improve the clinical identification and understanding of the complex neuropathological phenomena underlying CTE. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the neuropathological and clinical features of CTE, proposed biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both research and clinical settings, and a range of treatments based on previous preclinical and clinical research studies. Due to the heterogeneity of TBI, there is no universally agreed-upon serum, CSF, or neuroimaging marker for its diagnosis. However, as our understanding of this complex disease continues to evolve, it is likely that there will be more robust, early diagnostic methods and effective clinical treatments. This is especially important given the increasing evidence of a correlation between TBI and neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and CTE. As public awareness of these conditions grows, it is imperative to prioritize both basic and clinical research, as well as the implementation of necessary safe and preventative measures.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); repetitive head impacts (RHI); traumatic brain injury (TBI); traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES),,"Fesharaki-Zadeh, A"

Inhibition of NMDA Receptor Activation in the Rostral Ventrolateral Medulla by Amyloid-β Peptide in Rats.,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are important in regulating sympathetic tone and cardiovascular function in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases might be the risk factors for developing AD. The present study examines the acute effects of soluble Aβ on the function of NMDA receptors in rats RVLM. We used the magnitude of increases in the blood pressure (pressor responses) induced by microinjection of NMDA into the RVLM as an index of NMDA receptor function in the RVLM. Soluble Aβ was applied by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Aβ1-40 at a lower dose (0.2 nmol) caused a slight reduction, and a higher dose (2 nmol) showed a significant decrease in NMDA-induced pressor responses 10 min after administration. ICV injection of Aβ1-42 (2 nmol) did not affect NMDA-induced pressor responses in the RVLM. Co-administration of Aβ1-40 with ifenprodil or memantine blocked the inhibitory effects of Aβ1-40. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a significant increase in the immunoreactivity of phosphoserine 1480 of GluN2B subunits (pGluN2B-serine1480) in the neuron of the RVLM without significant changes in phosphoserine 896 of GluN1 subunits (pGluN1-serine896), GluN1 and GluN2B, 10 min following Aβ1-40 administration compared with saline. Interestingly, we found a much higher level of Aβ1-40 compared to that of Aβ1-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 10 min following ICV administration of the same dose (2 nmol) of the peptides. In conclusion, the results suggest that ICV Aβ1-40, but not Aβ1-42, produced an inhibitory effect on NMDA receptor function in the RVLM, which might result from changes in pGluN2B-serine1480 (regulated by casein kinase II). The different elimination of the peptides in the CSF might contribute to the differential effects of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 on NMDA receptor function.",2023,GluN2B; NMDA receptors; RVLM; amyloid-beta; cardiovascular function; phosphorylation,"Rats; Animals; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; N-Methylaspartate; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Phosphoserine; Blood Pressure","Islam, MS; Lai, CC; Wang, LH; Lin, HH"
Biomarkers associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative neurological illness with insidious onset. Due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of AD and different pathological changes, the clinical phenotypes of dementia are diverse, and these pathological changes also interact with each other. Therefore, it is of great significance to search for biomarkers that can diagnose these pathological changes to improve the ability to monitor the course of disease and treat the disease. The pathological mechanism hypothesis with high recognition of AD mainly includes the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) around neurons and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which results in the development of neuronal fiber tangles (NFTs) and mitochondrial dysfunction. AD is an irreversible disease; currently, there is no clinical cure or delay in the disease process of drugs, and there is a lack of effective early clinical diagnosis methods. AD patients, often in the dementia stages and moderate cognitive impairment, will seek medical treatment. Biomarkers can help diagnose the presence or absence of specific diseases and their pathological processes, so early screening and diagnosis are crucial for the prevention and therapy of AD in clinical practice. β-amyloid deposition (A), tau pathology (T), and neurodegeneration/neuronal damage (N), also known as the AT (N) biomarkers system, are widely validated core humoral markers for the diagnosis of AD. In this paper, the pathogenesis of AD related to AT (N) and the current research status of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood related biomarkers were reviewed. At the same time, the limitations of humoral markers in the diagnosis of AD were also discussed, and the future development of humoral markers for AD was prospected. In addition, the contents related to mitochondrial dysfunction, prion virology and intestinal microbiome related to AD are also described, so as to understand the pathogenesis of AD in many aspects and dimensions, so as to evaluate the pathological changes related to AD more comprehensively and accurately.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ; NFTs; biomarkers; tau,,"Wang, H; Sun, M; Li, W; Liu, X; Zhu, M; Qin, H"

However, current data often highlight discordant results about the ability of blood pTau to predict CSF status.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Blood; CSF; Plasma; pTau,Humans; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphorylation,"Antonioni, A; Raho, EM; Di Lorenzo, F"
Diffusion MRI tracks cortical microstructural changes during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.,"There is increased interest in developing markers reflecting microstructural changes that could serve as outcome measures in clinical trials. This is especially important after unexpected results in trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies targeting amyloid-β (Aβ), where morphological metrics from MRI showed increased volume loss despite promising clinical treatment effects. In this study, changes over time in cortical mean diffusivity, derived using diffusion tensor imaging, were investigated in a large cohort (n = 424) of non-demented participants from the Swedish BioFINDER study. Participants were stratified following the Aβ/tau (AT) framework. The results revealed a widespread increase in mean diffusivity over time, including both temporal and parietal cortical regions, in Aβ-positive but still tau-negative individuals. These increases were steeper in Aβ-positive and tau-positive individuals and robust to the inclusion of cortical thickness in the model. A steeper increase in mean diffusivity was also associated with both changes over time in fluid markers reflecting astrocytic activity (i.e. plasma level of glial fibrillary acidic protein and CSF levels of YKL-40) and worsening of cognitive performance (all P < 0.01). By tracking cortical microstructural changes over time and possibly reflecting variations related to the astrocytic response, cortical mean diffusivity emerges as a promising marker for tracking treatments-induced microstructural changes in clinical trials.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; astrocytes; clinical trials; cortical mean diffusivity,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Intermediate Filaments,"Spotorno, N; Strandberg, O; Stomrud, E; Janelidze, S; Blennow, K; Nilsson, M; van Westen, D; Hansson, O"

Four-dimensional flow MRI for quantitative assessment of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics: Status and opportunities.,"Neurological disorders can manifest with altered neurofluid dynamics in different compartments of the central nervous system. These include alterations in cerebral blood flow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, and tissue biomechanics. Noninvasive quantitative assessment of neurofluid flow and tissue motion is feasible with phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC MRI). While two-dimensional (2D) PC MRI is routinely utilized in research and clinical settings to assess flow dynamics through a single imaging slice, comprehensive neurofluid dynamic assessment can be limited or impractical. Recently, four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI (or time-resolved three-dimensional PC with three-directional velocity encoding) has emerged as a powerful extension of 2D PC, allowing for large volumetric coverage of fluid velocities at high spatiotemporal resolution within clinically reasonable scan times. Yet, most 4D flow studies have focused on blood flow imaging. Characterizing CSF flow dynamics with 4D flow (i.e., 4D CSF flow) is of high interest to understand normal brain and spine physiology, but also to study neurological disorders such as dysfunctional brain metabolite waste clearance, where CSF dynamics appear to play an important role. However, 4D CSF flow imaging is challenged by the long T1 time of CSF and slower velocities compared with blood flow, which can result in longer scan times from low flip angles and extended motion-sensitive gradients, hindering clinical adoption. In this work, we review the state of 4D CSF flow MRI including challenges, novel solutions from current research and ongoing needs, examples of clinical and research applications, and discuss an outlook on the future of 4D CSF flow.",2024,4D flow; CSF; MRI; Venc; dynamics; motion; phase contrast,"Humans; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Animals; Hydrodynamics; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Rheology","Rivera-Rivera, LA; Vikner, T; Eisenmenger, L; Johnson, SC; Johnson, KM"
High-Performance Plasma Biomarker Panel for Alzheimer's Disease Screening Using a Femtomolar-Level Label-Free Biosensing System.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older people. However, diagnosing AD through noncognitive methods, such as invasive cerebrospinal fluid sampling or radioactive positron emission tomography, has limited applications. Herein, the femtomolar levels of AD biomarkers amyloid β 40 (Aβ40), amyloid β 42 (Aβ42), phosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau181), phosphorylated tau 217 (P-tau217), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were determined in human plasma in multicenter clinical cohorts using an ultrasensitive graphene field-effect transistor sensor. A machine-learning algorithm was also used to assemble these plasma biomarkers and optimize their performance in discriminating individual stages of Alzheimer's dementia progression. The ""composite-info"" biomarker panel, which combines these biomarkers and clinical information, considerably improved the staging performance in AD progression. It achieved an area under the curve of >0.94 in the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.

Implementation of an ultra-sensitive microwell-based electrochemical sensor for the detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in elderly people. It is diagnosed by detecting amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture or through expensive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Although blood-based diagnosis of AD offers a less invasive and cost-effective alternative, the quantification of Aβ is technically challenging due to its low abundance in peripheral blood. To address this, we developed a compact yet highly sensitive microwell-based electrochemical sensor with a densely packed microelectrode array (20 by 20) for enhancing sensitivity. Employing microwells on the working and counter electrodes minimized the leakage current from the metallic conductors into the assay medium, refining the signal fidelity. We achieved a detection limit <10 fg/mL for Aβ by elevating the signal-to-noise ratio, thus capable of AD biomarker quantification. Moreover, the microwell structure maintained the performance irrespective of variations in bead number, indicative of the sensor's robustness. The sensor's efficacy was validated through the analysis of Aβ concentrations in plasma samples from 96 subjects, revealing a significant distinction between AD patients and healthy controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85. Consequently, our novel microwell-based electrochemical biosensor represents a highly sensitive platform for detecting scant blood-based biomarkers, including Aβ, offering substantial potential for advancing AD diagnostics.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid Beta; Limits of Detection (LOD); Magnetic beads; Microwell-based electrochemical sensor; Patient plasma sample,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biosensing Techniques; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Microelectrodes; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Roy, S; Kang, S; Choi, KY; Lee, KH; Shin, KS; Kang, JY"
Mass spectrometry in cerebrospinal fluid uncovers association of glycolysis biomarkers with Alzheimer's disease in a large clinical sample.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with contributions from multiple pathophysiological pathways. One of the long-recognized and important features of AD is disrupted cerebral glucose metabolism, but the underlying molecular basis remains unclear. In this study, unbiased mass spectrometry was used to survey CSF from a large clinical cohort, comparing patients who are either cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 68), suffering from mild-cognitive impairment or dementia from AD (MCI-AD, n = 95; DEM-AD, n = 72), or other causes (MCI-other, n = 77; DEM-other, n = 23), or Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH, n = 57). The results revealed changes related to altered glucose metabolism. In particular, two glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase (PKM) and aldolase A (ALDOA), were found to be upregulated in CSF from patients with AD compared to those with other neurological conditions. Increases in full-length PKM and ALDOA levels in CSF were confirmed with immunoblotting. Levels of these enzymes furthermore correlated negatively with CSF glucose in matching CSF samples. PKM levels were also found to be increased in AD in publicly available brain-tissue data. These results indicate that ALDOA and PKM may act as technically-robust potential biomarkers of glucose metabolism dysregulation in AD.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Mass Spectrometry; Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure; Glycolysis; Glucose; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments","de Geus, MB; Leslie, SN; Lam, T; Wang, W; Roux-Dalvai, F; Droit, A; Kivisakk, P; Nairn, AC; Arnold, SE; Carlyle, BC"
Altered cerebrovascular-CSF coupling in Alzheimer's Disease measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy.,"In-vivo microscopical studies indicate that brain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport driven by blood vessel pulsations is reduced in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that the coupling pattern between cerebrovascular pulsations and CSF is altered in AD, and this can be measured using multi-wavelength functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). To study this, we quantified simultaneously cerebral hemo- and CSF hydrodynamics in early AD patients and age-matched healthy controls. Physiological pulsations were analysed in the vasomotor very low frequency (VLF 0.008-0.1 Hz), respiratory (Resp. 0.1-0.6 Hz), and cardiac (Card. 0.6-5 Hz) bands. A sliding time window cross-correlation approach was used to estimate the temporal stability of the cerebrovascular-CSF coupling. We investigated how the lag time series variation of the coupling differs between AD patients and control. The couplings involving deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and CSF water, along with their first derivative, in the cardiac band demonstrated significant difference between AD patients and controls. Furthermore, the lag time series variation of HbR-CSF in the cardiac band provided a significant relationship, p-value = 0.04 and r",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; tau Proteins; Brain; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Ferdinando, H; Moradi, S; Korhonen, V; Kiviniemi, V; Myllylä, T"

Metabolomics studies the complete ensemble of endogenous and exogenous metabolites present in biological specimens and may provide an interesting approach to identify alterations in multiple biochemical processes associated with AD onset and evolution. In this mini review, we summarize the results from metabolomic studies conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on human biological samples (blood derivatives, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, and tissues) from AD patients. We describe the metabolic alterations identified in AD patients compared to controls and to patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, we discuss the challenges and issues associated with the application of NMR-based metabolomics in the context of AD research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; NMR; lipoproteins; metabolites; mild cognitive impairment,,"Vignoli, A; Tenori, L"
"Investigating the association between a history of depression and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, and neurodegeneration in patients with dementia.","The association between depression and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), remains an active area of research. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between a history of depression and biomarkers of AD and CVD in patients with dementia in a clinical setting. A total of 126 patients from the University Health Network (UHN) Memory Clinic with comprehensive clinical evaluations, including neuropsychological testing and medical examinations, were included. Lumbar puncture was performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for biomarker analysis, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained to assess white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden. The presence of depression was determined through medical records. The study findings did not reveal significant differences between participants with and without a history of depression in terms of AD biomarkers, WMH burden, neurofilament light chain levels, cognitive scores, age of symptom onset, disease duration, or vascular risk scores. Logistic regression analysis did not indicate a meaningful predictive value of these variables for depression status. This clinical study contributes to our understanding regarding the association between depression and AD/CVD biomarkers in patients with cognitive impairment. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex relationship between depression and dementia and to explore the potential mechanisms linking depression, AD, and CVD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; Cerebrovascular disease; Major depressive disorder; White matter hyperintensities,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Depression; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Brain; Biomarkers,"Salwierz, P; Thapa, S; Taghdiri, F; Vasilevskaya, A; Anastassiadis, C; Tang-Wai, DF; Golas, AC; Tartaglia, MC"
Serum Bile Acids Improve Prediction of Alzheimer's Progression in a Sex-Dependent Manner.,"Sex disparities in serum bile acid (BA) levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence have been established. However, the precise link between changes in serum BAs and AD development remains elusive. Here, authors quantitatively determined 33 serum BAs and 58 BA features in 4 219 samples collected from 1 180 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The findings revealed that these BA features exhibited significant correlations with clinical stages, encompassing cognitively normal (CN), early and late mild cognitive impairment, and AD, as well as cognitive performance. Importantly, these associations are more pronounced in men than women. Among participants with progressive disease stages (n = 660), BAs underwent early changes in men, occurring before AD. By incorporating BA features into diagnostic and predictive models, positive enhancements are achieved for all models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve improved from 0.78 to 0.91 for men and from 0.76 to 0.83 for women for the differentiation of CN and AD. Additionally, the key findings are validated in a subset of participants (n = 578) with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and tau levels. These findings underscore the role of BAs in AD progression, offering potential improvements in the accuracy of AD prediction.",2024,alzheimer's disease; bile acid; cholesterol; mild cognitive impairment; sex difference,Male; Humans; Female; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Bile Acids and Salts,"Chen, T; Wang, L; Xie, G; Kristal, BS; Zheng, X; Sun, T; Arnold, M; Louie, G; Li, M; Wu, L; Mahmoudiandehkordi, S; Sniatynski, MJ; Borkowski, K; Guo, Q; Kuang, J; Wang, J; Nho, K; Ren, Z; Kueider-Paisley, A; Blach, C; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Jia, W"

Nano biomaterials based strategies for enhanced brain targeting in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases: an up-to-date perspective.,"Neurons and their connecting axons gradually degenerate in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), leading to dysfunctionality of the neuronal cells and eventually their death. Drug delivery for the treatment of effected nervous system is notoriously complicated because of the presence of natural barriers, i.e., the blood-brain barrier and the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Palliative care is currently the standard care for many diseases. Therefore, treatment programs that target the disease's origin rather than its symptoms are recommended. Nanotechnology-based drug delivery platforms offer an innovative way to circumvent these obstacles and deliver medications directly to the central nervous system, thereby enabling treatment of several common neurological problems, i.e., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Interestingly, the combination of nanomedicine and gene therapy enables targeting of selective mutant genes responsible for the progression of NDs, which may provide a much-needed boost in the struggle against these diseases. Herein, we discussed various central nervous system delivery obstacles, followed by a detailed insight into the recently developed techniques to restore neurological function via the differentiation of neural stem cells. Moreover, a comprehensive background on the role of nanomedicine in controlling neurogenesis via differentiation of neural stem cells is explained. Additionally, numerous phytoconstituents with their neuroprotective properties and molecular targets in the identification and management of NDs are also deliberated. Furthermore, a detailed insight of the ongoing clinical trials and currently marketed products for the treatment of NDs is provided in this manuscript.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Gene therapy; Huntington’s disease; Nanomedicines; Neurodegenerative diseases; Parkinson disease; Phytoconstituents,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain; Blood-Brain Barrier; Drug Delivery Systems; Nanotechnology,"Nayab, DE; Din, FU; Ali, H; Kausar, WA; Urooj, S; Zafar, M; Khan, I; Shabbir, K; Khan, GM"
Role of sleep in neurodegeneration: the consensus report of the 5th Think Tank World Sleep Forum.,"Sleep abnormalities may represent an independent risk factor for neurodegeneration. An international expert group convened in 2021 to discuss the state-of-the-science in this domain. The present article summarizes the presentations and discussions concerning the importance of a strategy for studying sleep- and circadian-related interventions for early detection and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. An international expert group considered the current state of knowledge based on the most relevant publications in the previous 5 years; discussed the current challenges in the field of relationships among sleep, sleep disorders, and neurodegeneration; and identified future priorities. Sleep efficiency and slow wave activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are decreased in cognitively normal middle-aged and older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Sleep deprivation increases amyloid-β (Aβ) concentrations in the interstitial fluid of experimental animal models and in cerebrospinal fluid in humans, while increased sleep decreases Aβ. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for dementia. Studies indicate that positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment should be started in patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD and comorbid OSA. Identification of other measures of nocturnal hypoxia and sleep fragmentation could better clarify the role of OSA as a risk factor for neurodegeneration. Concerning REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), it will be crucial to identify the subset of RBD patients who will convert to a specific neurodegenerative disorder. Circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders (CSWRD) are strong predictors of caregiver stress and institutionalization, but the absence of recommendations or consensus statements must be considered. Future priorities include to develop and validate existing and novel comprehensive assessments of CSWRD in patients with/at risk for dementia. Strategies for studying sleep-circadian-related interventions for early detection/prevention of neurodegenerative diseases are required. CSWRD evaluation may help to identify additional biomarkers for phenotyping and personalizing treatment of neurodegeneration.",2024,Dementia; Neurodegeneration; Obstructive sleep apnea; Rem sleep behavior disorder; Sleep,"Middle Aged; Animals; Humans; Aged; Sleep; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Ferini-Strambi, L; Liguori, C; Lucey, BP; Mander, BA; Spira, AP; Videnovic, A; Baumann, C; Franco, O; Fernandes, M; Gnarra, O; Krack, P; Manconi, M; Noain, D; Saxena, S; Kallweit, U; Randerath, W; Trenkwalder, C; Rosenzweig, I; Iranzo, A; Bradicich, M; Bassetti, C"
A light at the end of the tunnel - from mutation identification to a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease.,"Recent advances have driven the development of immunotherapies that act by either promoting or suppressing a patient's immune system to treat inflammation, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, and several cancers. In addition, research conducted over the past 25 years has identified therapeutic targets and indicated that immunotherapy could be used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite a number of setbacks, this approach has now led to the development of the first disease-modifying treatments for this devastating disease. A key neuropathological feature of AD is the accumulation of a ~40-amino acid peptide known as amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain and cerebrovasculature. Our detection of an Aβ precursor protein mutation that caused early-onset AD in a Swedish family by enhancing Aβ protofibril formation sharpened the focus on soluble Aβ aggregates (oligomers and protofibrils) as viable therapeutic targets. Initial studies developed and tested a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb158) with specific conformation-dependent binding to these soluble Aβ aggregates. Treatment with mAb158 selectively reduced Aβ protofibrils in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of a transgenic mouse model of AD. A humanized version of mAb158 (lecanemab) subsequently entered clinical trials. Based on promising Phase 2 data showing plaque clearance and reduced cognitive decline, a Phase 3 trial found that lecanemab slowed decline on the primary cognitive endpoint by 27% over 18 months and also produced positive effects on secondary clinical endpoints and key biomarkers. In July 2023, the FDA granted lecanemab a full approval, and this therapeutic antibody will be marketed as Leqembi®. This represents a significant advance for patients with AD, although many challenges remain. In particular, it is now more important than ever to identify individuals who are vulnerable to AD, so that treatment can be initiated at an early stage in the disease process.",2023,Immunotherapy; Leqembi®; amyloid beta; lecanemab; monoclonal antibody; neurodegeneration,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation","Lannfelt, L"
Machine Learning models for detection and assessment of progression in Alzheimer's disease based on blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.,"Machine-learning techniques were applied to human blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data related to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients available via Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We observed the accuracy of AD diagnosis is greatest when protein biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid are combined with plasma proteins using Support Vector Machines (SVM); this is not improved by adding age and sex. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for our model of AD diagnosis based on a full (unbiased) set of plasma proteins was 0.94 in cross-validation and 0.82 on an external validation (test) set. Taking plasma in combination with CSF, the model reaches 0.98 area under the ROC curve on the test set. Accuracy of prediction of risk of mild cognitive impairment progressing to AD is the same for blood plasma biomarkers as for CSF and is not improved by combining them or adding age and sex as covariates.Clinical relevance- The identification of accurate and cost-effective biomarkers to screen for risk of developing AD and monitoring its progression is crucial for improved understanding of its causes and stratification of patients for treatments under development.

"Proteomic comparison between non-purified cerebrospinal fluid and cerebrospinal fluid-derived extracellular vesicles from patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lewy body dementia.","Dementia is a leading cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence as global life expectancy increases. The most common neurodegenerative disorders are Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). With this study, we took an in-depth look at the proteome of the (non-purified) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the CSF-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) of AD, PD, PD-MCI (Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment), PDD and DLB patients analysed by label-free mass spectrometry. This has led to the discovery of differentially expressed proteins that may be helpful for differential diagnosis. We observed a greater number of differentially expressed proteins in CSF-derived EV samples (N = 276) compared to non-purified CSF (N = 169), with minimal overlap between both datasets. This finding suggests that CSF-derived EV samples may be more suitable for the discovery phase of a biomarker study, due to the removal of more abundant proteins, resulting in a narrower dynamic range. As disease-specific markers, we selected a total of 39 biomarker candidates identified in non-purified CSF, and 37 biomarker candidates across the different diseases under investigation in the CSF-derived EV data. After further exploration and validation of these proteins, they can be used to further differentiate between the included dementias and may offer new avenues for research into more disease-specific pharmacological therapeutics.",2023,biomarkers; cerebrospinal fluid; dementia; extracellular vesicles; mass spectrometry; proteomics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Lewy Body Disease; Parkinson Disease; Dementia; Proteomics; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers,"Hirschberg, Y; Valle-Tamayo, N; Dols-Icardo, O; Engelborghs, S; Buelens, B; Vandenbroucke, RE; Vermeiren, Y; Boonen, K; Mertens, I"
A Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer's Disease: a serum and CSF-based metabolic analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a person's dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KD's metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.",2023,,,"Schweickart, A; Batra, R; Neth, BJ; Martino, C; Shenhav, L; Zhang, AR; Shi, P; Karu, N; Huynh, K; Meikle, PJ; Schimmel, L; Dilmore, AH; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Blach, C; Dorrestein, PC; Knight, R; Craft, S; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Krumsiek, J"

Harmonization of CSF and imaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: Need and practical applications for genetics studies and preclinical classification.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Amyloid beta (Aβ), Tau and pTau are the most accepted and well validated biomarkers. Several methods and platforms exist to measure those biomarkers, leading to challenges in combining data across studies. Thus, there is a need to identify methods that harmonize and standardize these values. We used a Z-score based approach to harmonize CSF and amyloid imaging data from multiple cohorts and compared GWAS results using this approach with currently accepted methods. We also used a generalized mixture model to calculate the threshold for biomarker-positivity. Based on our findings, our normalization approach performed as well as meta-analysis and did not lead to any spurious results. In terms of dichotomization, cutoffs calculated with this approach were very similar to those reported previously. These findings show that the Z-score based harmonization approach can be applied to heterogeneous platforms and provides biomarker cut-offs consistent with the classical approaches without requiring any additional data.",2024,Alzheimer's; Biomarkers; Dichotomization; Harmonization; Imaging; Meta-analysis; Mixture modelling; Z-scores,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Timsina, J; Ali, M; Do, A; Wang, L; Western, D; Sung, YJ; Cruchaga, C"
Extracellular vesicle proteome unveils cathepsin B connection to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane vesicles that are released extracellularly and considered to be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Here, CSF EVs of 16 ATN-classified cases were subjected to quantitative proteome analysis. In these CSF EVs, levels of 11 proteins were significantly altered during the ATN stage transitions (P < 0.05 and fold-change > 2.0). These proteins were thought to be associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and represent candidate biomarkers for pathogenic stage classification. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of CSF and plasma EVs revealed altered levels of cathepsin B (CatB) during the ATN transition (seven ATN groups in validation set, n = 136). The CSF and plasma EV CatB levels showed a negative correlation with CSF amyloid-β42 concentrations. This proteomic landscape of CSF EVs in ATN classifications can depict the molecular framework of Alzheimer's disease progression, and CatB may be considered a promising candidate biomarker and therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease amyloid pathology.",2024,ATN classification; Alzheimer’s disease; blood biomarker; cathepsin B; extracellular vesicle,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Proteome; Cathepsin B; Proteomics; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Yuyama, K; Sun, H; Fujii, R; Hemmi, I; Ueda, K; Igeta, Y"

Cerebrospinal and Blood Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: Did Mild Cognitive Impairment Definition Affect Their Clinical Usefulness?,"Despite Alzheimer's Disease (AD) being known from the times of Alois Alzheimer, who lived more than one century ago, many aspects of the disease are still obscure, including the pathogenesis, the clinical spectrum definition, and the therapeutic approach. Well-established biomarkers for AD come from the histopathological hallmarks of the disease, which are Aβ and phosphorylated Tau protein aggregates. Consistently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Amyloid β (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau level measurements are currently used to detect AD presence. However, two central biases affect these biomarkers. Firstly, incomplete knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases legitimates the search for novel molecules that, reasonably, could be expressed by neurons and microglia and could be detected in blood simpler and earlier than the classical markers and in a higher amount. Further, studies have been performed to evaluate whether CSF biomarkers can predict AD onset in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. However, the MCI definition has changed over time. Hence, the studies on MCI patients seem to be biased at the beginning due to the imprecise enrollment and heterogeneous composition of the miscellaneous MCI subgroup. Plasma biomarkers and novel candidate molecules, such as microglia biomarkers, have been tentatively investigated and could represent valuable targets for diagnosing and monitoring AD. Also, novel AD markers are urgently needed to identify molecular targets for treatment strategies.

We also examined the linear relationship between liver function, CSF AD biomarkers, and cognition using linear regression models. Furthermore, mediation analyses were applied to explore the potential mediation effects of AD pathological biomarkers on cognition. Our findings indicated that, with AD pathological and clinical progression, the concentrations of total protein (TP), globulin (GLO), and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transaminase (ALT) increased, while albumin/globulin (A/G), adenosine deaminase, alpha-L-fucosidase, albumin, prealbumin, ALT, and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) concentrations decreased.

Memory performance mediates subjective sleep quality associations with cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarker levels and hippocampal volume among individuals with mild cognitive symptoms.,"Sleep disturbances are prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting individuals during its early stages. We investigated associations between subjective sleep measures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD in adults with mild cognitive symptoms from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia Longitudinal Cohort Study, considering the influence of memory performance. A total of 442 participants aged >50 years with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and underwent neuropsychological assessment, magnetic resonance imaging acquisition, and CSF sampling. We analysed the relationship of sleep quality with CSF AD biomarkers and cognitive performance in separated multivariate linear regression models, adjusting for covariates. Poorer cross-sectional sleep quality was associated with lower CSF levels of phosphorylated tau and total tau alongside better immediate and delayed memory performance. After adjustment for delayed memory scores, associations between CSF biomarkers and sleep quality became non-significant, and further analysis revealed that memory performance mediated this relationship. In post hoc analyses, poorer subjective sleep quality was associated with lesser hippocampal atrophy, with memory performance also mediating this association. In conclusion, worse subjective sleep quality is associated with less altered AD biomarkers in adults with mild cognitive symptoms (CDR score 0.5). These results could be explained by a systematic recall bias affecting subjective sleep assessment in individuals with incipient memory impairment. Caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting subjective sleep quality measures in memory-impaired populations, emphasising the importance of complementing subjective measures with objective assessments.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); biomarkers; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); dementia; memory impairment; mild cognitive impairment (MCI); sleep,Humans; Male; Female; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Hippocampus; Aged; tau Proteins; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Sleep Quality; Neuropsychological Tests; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Memory; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Stankeviciute, L; Blackman, J; Tort-Colet, N; Fernández-Arcos, A; Sánchez-Benavides, G; Suárez-Calvet, M; Iranzo, Á; Molinuevo, JL; Gispert, JD; Coulthard, E; Grau-Rivera, O"
CSF 14-3-3β is associated with progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by amyloid-beta plaques, tau tangles and neuronal loss. In clinical practice, the 14-3-3 isoform beta (β) is a biomarker that aids in the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Recently, a proteomics study found increased CSF 14-3-3β levels in Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting a potential link between CSF 14-3-3β and Alzheimer's disease. Our present study aimed to further investigate the role of CSF 14-3-3β in Alzheimer's disease by analysing the data of 719 participants with available CSF 14-3-3β measurements from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Higher CSF 14-3-3β levels were observed in the mild cognitive impairment group compared to the cognitively normal group, with the highest CSF 14-3-3β levels in the Alzheimer's disease dementia group. This study also found significant associations between CSF 14-3-3β levels and CSF biomarkers of p-tau, t-tau, pTau/Aβ42 ratios and GAP-43, as well as other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers such as Aβ-PET. An early increase in CSF 14-3-3β levels was observed prior to Aβ-PET-positive status, and CSF 14-3-3β levels continued to rise after crossing the Aβ-PET positivity threshold before reaching a plateau. The diagnostic accuracy of CSF 14-3-3β (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.819) was moderate compared to other established Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in distinguishing cognitively normal Aβ pathology-negative individuals from Alzheimer's disease Aβ pathology-positive individuals. Higher baseline CSF 14-3-3β levels were associated with accelerated cognitive decline, reduced hippocampus volumes and declining fluorodeoxyglucose-PET values over a 4-year follow-up period. Patients with mild cognitive impairment and high CSF 14-3-3β levels at baseline had a significantly increased risk [hazard ratio = 2.894 (1.599-5.238), ",2023,14-3-3β; Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; biomarker; dementia,,"Qiang, Q; Skudder-Hill, L; Toyota, T; Huang, Z; Wei, W; Adachi, H"
Cognitive Profile in Parkinson's Disease Dementia Patients with Low versus Normal Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid Beta.,"In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta 1-42 (Ab42) at baseline is the most consistent CSF biomarker as a risk factor for developing dementia. Low CSF Ab42 is, however, a typical hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, low CSF Ab42 in patients with PD may indicate presence of comorbid AD pathology and may predict a more AD-like cognitive profile when they develop dementia.

Targeting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by neutralizing seeding-competent TDP-43 in CSF.,"In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease driven by abnormal transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa aggregation, CSF may contain pathological species of transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa contributing to the propagation of pathology and neuronal toxicity. These species, released in part by degenerating neurons, would act as a template for the aggregation of physiological protein contributing to the spread of pathology in the brain and spinal cord. In this study, a robust seed amplification assay was established to assess the presence of seeding-competent transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa species in CSF of apparently sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. These samples resulted in a significant acceleration of substrate aggregation differentiating the kinetics from healthy controls. In parallel, a second assay was developed to determine the level of target engagement that would be necessary to neutralize such species in human CSF by a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa.

Detection of neuron-derived cfDNA in blood plasma: a new diagnostic approach for neurodegenerative conditions.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose significant challenges in early diagnosis, leading to irreversible brain damage and cognitive decline. In this study, we present a novel diagnostic approach that utilizes whole molecule analysis of neuron-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing Differential Methylation Regions (DMRs) between purified cortical neurons and blood plasma samples, we identified robust biomarkers that accurately distinguish between neuronal and non-neuronal cfDNA. The use of cfDNA offers the advantage of convenient and minimally invasive sample collection compared to traditional cerebrospinal fluid or tissue biopsies, making this approach more accessible and patient friendly. Targeted sequencing at the identified DMR locus demonstrated that a conservative cutoff of 5% of neuron-derived cfDNA in blood plasma accurately identifies 100% of patients diagnosed with AD, showing promising potential for early disease detection. Additionally, this method effectively differentiated between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who later progressed to AD and those who did not, highlighting its prognostic capabilities. Importantly, the differentiation between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls demonstrated the specificity of our approach. Furthermore, this cfDNA-based diagnostic strategy outperforms recently developed protein-based assays, which often lack accuracy and convenience. While our current approach focused on a limited set of loci, future research should explore the development of a more comprehensive model incorporating multiple loci to increase diagnostic accuracy further. Although certain limitations, such as technical variance associated with PCR amplification and bisulfite conversion, need to be addressed, this study emphasizes the potential of cfDNA analysis as a valuable tool for pre-symptomatic detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. With further development and validation, this innovative diagnostic strategy has the potential to significantly impact the field of neurodegenerative disease research and patient care, offering a promising avenue for early intervention and personalized therapeutic approaches.",2023,Alzheimer’s; DNA methylation; cfDNA; disease monitoring; neurodegenerative diseases; pre-symptomatic diagnostic,,"Pollard, C; Aston, K; Emery, BR; Hill, J; Jenkins, T"

Nanoparticle-Mediated Delivery of Anti-PU.1 siRNA via Localized Intracisternal Administration Reduces Neuroinflammation.,"Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia, the brain's immune cells, express many of the AD-risk loci identified in genome wide association studies and present a promising target for anti-inflammatory RNA therapeutics but are difficult to transfect with current methods. Here, several lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are examined, and a lead candidate that supports efficient RNA delivery in cultures of human stem cell-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs) and animal models of neuroinflammation is identified. The lead microglia LNP (MG-LNP) formulation shows minimal toxicity and improves delivery efficiency to inflammatory iMGLs, suggesting a preference for delivery into activated microglia. Intraperitoneal injection of the MG-LNP formulation generates widespread expression of the delivered reporter construct in all organs, whereas local intracisternal injection directly into the cerebrospinal fluid leads to preferential expression in the brain. It is shown that LNP-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting the PU.1 transcription factor, a known AD-risk locus, successfully reduces PU.1 levels in iMGLs and reduces neuroinflammation in mice injected with LPS and in CK-p25 mice that mimic the chronic neuroinflammation seen in AD patients. The LNP formulation represents an effective RNA delivery vehicle when applied intrathecally and can be broadly utilized to test potential neuroinflammation-directed gene therapies.",2024,RNA delivery; lipid nanoparticles; microglia; neurodegeneration; neuroinflammation,"Humans; Animals; Mice; RNA, Small Interfering; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Nanoparticles","Ralvenius, WT; Andresen, JL; Huston, MM; Penney, J; Bonner, JM; Fenton, OS; Langer, R; Tsai, LH"

Effects of Neighboring Phosphorylation Events on the Affinities of pT181-Tau Antibodies.,"A tau variant phosphorylated on threonine 181 (pT181-tau) has been widely investigated as a potential Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. pT181-tau is present in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of AD brains, and CSF levels of pT181-tau correlate with the overall NFT burden. Various immunobased analytical methods, including Western blotting and ELISA, have been used to quantify pT181-tau in human biofluids. The reliability of these methods is dependent on the affinity and binding specificity of the antibodies used to measure pT181-tau levels. Although both of these properties could, in principle, be affected by phosphorylation within or near the antibody's cognate antigen, such effects have not been extensively studied. Here, we developed a biolayer interferometry assay to determine the degree to which the affinity of pT181-tau antibodies is altered by the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues near the target epitope. Our results revealed that phosphorylation near T181 negatively affected the binding of pT181-tau antibodies to their cognate antigen to varying degrees. In particular, two of three antibodies tested showed a complete loss of affinity for the pT181 target when S184 or S185 was phosphorylated. These findings highlight the importance of selecting antibodies that have been thoroughly characterized in terms of affinity and binding specificity, addressing the potential disruptive effects of post-translational modifications in the epitope region to ensure accurate biomarker quantitation.",2023,,Humans; Phosphorylation; tau Proteins; Reproducibility of Results; Alzheimer Disease; Antibodies; Antigens; Epitopes; Threonine; Biomarkers,"Min, S; Mohallem, R; Aryal, UK; Kinzer-Ursem, TL; Rochet, JC"

TANGO: a placebo-controlled randomized phase 2 study of efficacy and safety of the anti-tau monoclonal antibody gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease, the spread of aberrantly phosphorylated tau is an important criterion in the Braak staging of disease severity and correlates with disease symptomatology. Here, we report the results of TANGO ( NCT03352557 ), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and multiple-dose long-term trial of gosuranemab-a monoclonal antibody to N-terminal tau-in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of gosuranemab compared to placebo. The secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of multiple doses of gosuranemab in slowing cognitive and functional impairment (using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores at week 78) and evaluate the immunogenicity of gosuranemab (using the incidence of anti-gosuranemab antibody responses). Participants were randomized (n = 654); received (n = 650) low-dose (125 mg once every 4 weeks (q4w), n = 58; 375 mg q12w, n = 58), intermediate-dose (600 mg q4w, n = 106) or high-dose (2,000 mg q4w, n = 214) gosuranemab or placebo (q4w, n = 214) intravenously for 78 weeks; and assigned to cerebrospinal fluid (n = 327) and/or tau positron emission tomography (n = 357) biomarker substudies. Gosuranemab had an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated (incidence of serious adverse events: placebo, 12.1%; low dose, 10.3%; intermediate dose, 12.3%; high dose, 11.7%). The incidence of treatment-emergent gosuranemab antibody responses was low at all time points. No significant effects were identified in cognitive and functional tests as no dose resulted in a favorable change from the baseline CDR-SB score at week 78 compared to placebo control (adjusted mean change: placebo, 1.85; low dose, 2.20; intermediate dose, 2.24; high dose, 1.85).

Genome-Wide Association Analysis across Endophenotypes in Alzheimer's Disease: Main Effects and Disease Stage-Specific Interactions.,"The underlying genetic susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not yet fully understood. The heterogeneous nature of the disease challenges genetic association studies. Endophenotype approaches can help to address this challenge by more direct interrogation of biological traits related to the disease. AD endophenotypes based on amyloid-β, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers and cognitive performance were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 1565). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of quantitative phenotypes was performed using an SNP main effect and an SNP by Diagnosis interaction (SNP × DX) model to identify disease stage-specific genetic effects. Nine loci were identified as study-wide significant with one or more A/T/N endophenotypes in the main effect model, as well as additional findings significantly associated with cognitive measures. These nine loci include SNPs in or near the genes APOE, SRSF10, HLA-DQB1, XKR3, and KIAA1671. The SNP × DX model identified three study-wide significant genetic loci (BACH2, EP300, and PACRG-AS1) with a neuroprotective effect in later AD stage endophenotypes.

Alzheimer's Disease CSF Biomarkers as Possible Indicators of Tap-Test Response in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"The aim of the present study is the evaluation of established Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), both individually and as a total profile, and the investigation of their use as potential predictors of Tap-test responsiveness. Fifty-three patients with iNPH participated in the study. Aβ42, Aβ40, total Tau and phospho-Tau proteins were measured in duplicate with double-sandwich ELISA assays. Clinical evaluation involved a 10 m timed walk test before an evacuative lumbar puncture (LP) and every 24 h for three consecutive days afterwards. Neuropsychological assessment involved a mini-mental state examination, frontal assessment battery, 5-word test and CLOX drawing test 1 and 2, which were also performed before and 48 h after LP. Response in the Tap-test was defined as a 20% improvement in gait and/or a 10% improvement in neuropsychological tests. The Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was found to be significantly higher in Tap-test responders than non-responders. Total Tau and phospho-Tau CSF levels also differed significantly between these two groups, with Tap-test responders presenting with lower levels compared to non-responders. Regarding the AD CSF biomarker profile (decreased amyloid and increased Tau proteins levels), patients with a non-AD profile were more likely to have a positive response in the Tap-test than patients with an AD profile.",2023,AD; Aβ42; Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio; CSF biomarkers; Tap-test; idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus; phospho-Tau; total Tau,,"Pyrgelis, ES; Paraskevas, GP; Constantinides, VC; Boufidou, F; Papaioannou, M; Stefanis, L; Kapaki, E"

Cerebrospinal fluid neutral lipids predict progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.,"Genetic, metabolic, and clinical evidence links lipid dysregulation to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of lipids in the pathophysiological processes of AD and its clinical progression is unclear. We investigated the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipidome and the pathological hallmarks of AD, progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, and the rate of cognitive decline in MCI patients. The CSF lipidome was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in an LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS platform for 209 participants: 91 AD, 92 MCI, and 26 control participants. The MCI patients were followed up for a median of 58 (± 12.5) months to evaluate their clinical progression to AD. Forty-eight (52.2%) MCI patients progressed to AD during follow-up. We found that higher CSF levels of hexacosanoic acid and ceramide Cer(d38:4) were associated with an increased risk of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) positivity in CSF, while levels of phosphatidylethanolamine PE(40:0) were associated with a reduced risk. Higher CSF levels of sphingomyelin SM(30:1) were positively associated with pathological levels of phosphorylated tau in CSF. Cholesteryl ester CE(11D3:1) and an unknown lipid were recognized as the most associated lipid species with MCI to AD progression. Furthermore, TG(O-52:2) was identified as the lipid most strongly associated with the rate of progression. Our results indicate the involvement of membrane and intracellular neutral lipids in the pathophysiological processes of AD and the progression from MCI to AD dementia. Therefore, CSF neutral lipids can be used as potential prognostic markers for AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Lipidomics; Mild cognitive impairment; Neutral lipids; Progression,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments; Cognitive Dysfunction; Lipids,"Dakterzada, F; Jové, M; Huerto, R; Carnes, A; Sol, J; Pamplona, R; Piñol-Ripoll, G"
Correlational analyses of biomarkers that are harmonized through a bridging study due to measurement errors.,"Evaluating correlations between disease biomarkers and clinical outcomes is crucial in biomedical research. During the early stages of many chronic diseases, changes in biomarkers and clinical outcomes are often subtle. A major challenge to detecting subtle correlations is that studies with large sample sizes are usually needed to achieve sufficient statistical power. This challenge is even greater when biofluid and imaging biomarker data are used because the required procedures are burdensome, perceived as invasive, and/or expensive, limiting sample sizes in individual studies. Combining data across multiple studies may increase statistical power, but biomarker data may be generated using different assay platforms, scanner types, or processing protocols, which may affect measured biomarker values. Therefore, harmonizing biomarker data is essential to combining data across studies. Bridging studies involve re-processing of a subset of samples or imaging scans to evaluate how biomarker values vary by studies. This presents an analytic challenge on how to best harmonize biomarker data across studies to allow unbiased and optimal estimates of their correlations with standardized clinical outcomes. We conceptualize that a latent biomarker underlies the observed biomarkers across studies, and propose a novel approach that integrates the data in the bridging study with the study-specific biomarker data for estimating the biological correlations between biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Through extensive simulations, we compare our method to several alternative methods/algorithms often used to estimate the correlations. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this methodology to a real-world multi-center Alzheimer's disease biomarker study to correlate cerebrospinal fluid biomarker concentrations with cognitive outcomes.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Fisher transformation; bridging cohort; correlation; harmonization; intra-class correlation; latent variable,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Biomedical Research; Biomarkers; Algorithms,"Xiong, C; Schindler, SE; Henson, RL; Wolk, DA; Shaw, LM; Agboola, F; Morris, JC; Lu, R; Luo, J"
Impairments in sleep and brain molecular clearance in people with cognitive deterioration and biological evidence of AD: a report of four cases.,"Recent evidence suggests that the failure of the glymphatic system - the brain's waste clearance system, which is active during sleep - plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 in at-risk adults and autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer brains.,"Insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and their receptors are highly expressed in the adult hippocampus. Thus, disturbances in the insulin-IGF signalling pathway may account for the selective vulnerability of the hippocampus to nascent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In the present study, we examined the predominant IGF-binding protein in the CSF, IGFBP2. CSF was collected from 109 asymptomatic members of the parental history-positive PREVENT-AD cohort. CSF levels of IGFBP2, core AD and synaptic biomarkers were measured using proximity extension assay, ELISA and mass spectrometry. Cortical amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposition were examined using 18F-NAV4694 and flortaucipir. Cognitive assessments were performed during up to 8 years of follow-up, using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. T1-weighted structural MRI scans were acquired, and neuroimaging analyses were performed on pre-specified temporal and parietal brain regions. Next, in an independent cohort, we allocated 241 dementia-free ADNI-1 participants into four stages of AD progression based on the biomarkers CSF Aβ42 and total-tau (t-tau). In this analysis, differences in CSF and plasma IGFBP2 levels were examined across the pathological stages. Finally, IGFBP2 mRNA and protein levels were examined in the frontal cortex of 55 autopsy-confirmed AD and 31 control brains from the Quebec Founder Population (QFP) cohort, a unique population isolated from Eastern Canada. CSF IGFBP2 progressively increased over 5 years in asymptomatic PREVENT-AD participants. Baseline CSF IGFBP2 was positively correlated with CSF AD biomarkers and synaptic biomarkers, and negatively correlated with longitudinal changes in delayed memory (P = 0.024) and visuospatial abilities (P = 0.019). CSF IGFBP2 was negatively correlated at a trend-level with entorhinal cortex volume (P = 0.082) and cortical thickness in the piriform (P = 0.039), inferior temporal (P = 0.008), middle temporal (P = 0.014) and precuneus (P = 0.033) regions. In ADNI-1, CSF (P = 0.009) and plasma (P = 0.001) IGFBP2 were significantly elevated in Stage 2 [CSF Aβ(+)/t-tau(+)]. In survival analyses in ADNI-1, elevated plasma IGFBP2 was associated with a greater rate of AD conversion (hazard ratio = 1.62, P = 0.021). In the QFP cohort, IGFBP2 mRNA was reduced (P = 0.049); however, IGFBP2 protein levels did not differ in the frontal cortex of autopsy-confirmed AD brains (P = 0.462). Nascent AD pathology may induce an upregulation in IGFBP2 in asymptomatic individuals. CSF and plasma IGFBP2 may be valuable markers for identifying CSF Aβ(+)/t-tau(+) individuals and those with a greater risk of AD conversion.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; RBANS; cerebrospinal fluid; insulin-like growth factor; insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2; post-mortem brain tissue,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Brain; Autopsy; Aged, 80 and over; Disease Progression; Cohort Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests","Quesnel, MJ; Labonté, A; Picard, C; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Brinkmalm, A; Villeneuve, S; Poirier, J"

Specific serum autoantibodies predict the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease with high accuracy.,"Autoimmunity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether autoantibodies in peripheral blood can be used as biomarkers for AD has been elusive. Serum samples were obtained from 1,686 participants, including 767 with AD, 146 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 255 with other neurodegenerative diseases, and 518 healthy controls. Specific autoantibodies were measured using a custom-made immunoassay. Multivariate support vector machine models were employed to investigate the correlation between serum autoantibody levels and disease states. As a result, seven candidate AD-specific autoantibodies were identified, including MAPT, DNAJC8, KDM4D, SERF1A, CDKN1A, AGER, and ASXL1. A classification model with high accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.94) was established. Importantly, these autoantibodies could distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative diseases and out-performed amyloid and tau protein concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid in predicting cognitive decline (P < 0.001). This study indicated that AD onset and progression are possibly accompanied by an unappreciated serum autoantibody response. Therefore, future studies could optimize its application as a convenient biomarker for the early detection of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarker; Early detection; Predicting; Serum autoantibodies,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Autoantibodies; Disease Progression; Peptide Fragments; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases; Nerve Tissue Proteins,"Fang, L; Jiao, B; Liu, X; Wang, Z; Yuan, P; Zhou, H; Xiao, X; Cao, L; Guo, J; Tang, B; Shen, L"
Sex-specific modulation of amyloid-β on tau phosphorylation underlies faster tangle accumulation in females.,"Females are disproportionately affected by dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Despite a similar amyloid-β (Aβ) load, a higher load of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is seen in females than males. Previous literature has proposed that Aβ and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) synergism accelerates tau tangle formation, yet the effect of biological sex in this process has been overlooked. In this observational study, we examined longitudinal neuroimaging data from the TRIAD and ADNI cohorts from Canada and USA, respectively. We assessed 457 participants across the clinical spectrum of Alzheimer's disease. All participants underwent baseline multimodal imaging assessment, including MRI and PET, with radioligands targeting Aβ plaques and tau tangles, respectively. CSF data were also collected. Follow-up imaging assessments were conducted at 1- and 2-year intervals for the TRIAD cohort and 1-, 2- and 4-year intervals for the ADNI cohort. The upstream pathological events contributing to faster tau progression in females were investigated-specifically, whether the contribution of Aβ and p-tau synergism to accelerated tau tangle formation is modulated by biological sex. We hypothesized that cortical Aβ predisposes tau phosphorylation and tangle accumulation in a sex-specific manner. Findings revealed that Aβ-positive females presented higher CSF p-tau181 concentrations compared with Aβ-positive males in both the TRIAD (P = 0.04, Cohen's d = 0.51) and ADNI (P = 0.027, Cohen's d = 0.41) cohorts. In addition, Aβ-positive females presented faster NFT accumulation compared with their male counterparts (TRIAD: P = 0.026, Cohen's d = 0.52; ADNI: P = 0.049, Cohen's d = 1.14). Finally, the triple interaction between female sex, Aβ and CSF p-tau181 was revealed as a significant predictor of accelerated tau accumulation at the 2-year follow-up visit (Braak I: P = 0.0067, t = 2.81; Braak III: P = 0.017, t = 2.45; Braak IV: P = 0.002, t = 3.17; Braak V: P = 0.006, t = 2.88; Braak VI: P = 0.0049, t = 2.93). Overall, we report sex-specific modulation of cortical Aβ in tau phosphorylation, consequently facilitating faster NFT progression in female individuals over time. This presents important clinical implications and suggests that early intervention that targets Aβ plaques and tau phosphorylation may be a promising therapeutic strategy in females to prevent the further accumulation and spread of tau aggregates.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-β; sex difference; tau neurofibrillary tangle progression; tau phsophorylation,"Humans; Male; Female; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphorylation; Brain; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Plaque, Amyloid; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers","Wang, YT; Therriault, J; Servaes, S; Tissot, C; Rahmouni, N; Macedo, AC; Fernandez-Arias, J; Mathotaarachchi, SS; Benedet, AL; Stevenson, J; Ashton, NJ; Lussier, FZ; Pascoal, TA; Zetterberg, H; Rajah, MN; Blennow, K; Gauthier, S; Rosa-Neto, P"

"Trajectories of CSF and plasma biomarkers across Alzheimer's disease continuum: disease staging by NF-L, p-tau181, and GFAP.","CSF-to-plasma transition will open new avenues for molecular phenotyping of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we evaluated a panel of AD biomarkers in matched CSF and plasma samples across the AD continuum, from preclinical AD to dementia. The aims were to: 1) compare diagnostic performance of the two biofluids, 2) evaluate trajectories of the biomarkers along AD progression. We analyzed CSF and plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau231, t-tau, NF-L, GFAP, UCHL-1 and CSF SNAP-25 in a cohort (n = 173) of preclinical AD, MCI-AD, AD dementia, frontotemporal dementia patients, and controls. We found a significant correlation between CSF and plasma levels of Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau231, NF-L, and GFAP, while no CSF-plasma correlation was observed for t-tau and UCHL-1. Next to the core CSF biomarkers (Aβ42/40, p-tau181, t-tau), those providing the best discrimination between controls and preclinical AD were CSF p-tau231 and SNAP-25 and plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau231, and GFAP. Among plasma biomarkers, we found Aβ42/Aβ40, GFAP, and p-tau231 to show the largest rate of change at the CSF biomarker-defined cut-offs for amyloidosis and tauopathy. Finally, we identified GFAP, NF-L, and p-tau181 as the biomarkers most significantly associated with disease progression in both CSF and plasma.

"Anti-Amyloid Therapy, AD, and ARIA: Untangling the Role of CAA.","Anti-amyloid therapies (AATs), such as anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, are emerging treatments for people with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). AATs target amyloid β plaques in the brain. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), abnormal signals seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in patients with AD, may occur spontaneously but occur more frequently as side effects of AATs. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a major risk factor for ARIA. Amyloid β plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD and of CAA. Amyloid β accumulation in the brain parenchyma as plaques is a pathological hallmark of AD, whereas amyloid β accumulation in cerebral vessels leads to CAA. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of ARIA is necessary for early detection of those at highest risk. This could lead to improved risk stratification and the ultimate reduction of symptomatic ARIA. Histopathological confirmation of CAA by brain biopsy or autopsy is the gold standard but is not clinically feasible. MRI is an available in vivo tool for detecting CAA. Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid β level testing and amyloid PET imaging are available but do not offer specificity for CAA vs amyloid plaques in AD. Thus, developing and testing biomarkers as reliable and sensitive screening tools for the presence and severity of CAA is a priority to minimize ARIA complications.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; amyloid β; anti-amyloid therapy; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; plasma,,"Sin, MK; Zamrini, E; Ahmed, A; Nho, K; Hajjar, I"

Volume biomarkers included total brain volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF), lateral ventricular volume, white matter lesion volume, subarachnoid CSF, and grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), all normalized to intracranial volume. The mean intensity, kurtosis, and skewness of the GM and WM made up the intensity features. Texture features quantified homogeneity and microstructural tissue changes of GM and WM regions. Composite indices were also considered, which are biomarkers that represent an aggregate sum (z-score normalization and summation) of all biomarkers. The FLAIR MRI biomarkers successfully identified high-risk subjects as significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between the means of the sMCI and cMCI groups and the rate of change over time for several individual biomarkers as well as the composite indices for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Classification accuracy and feature importance analysis showed volume biomarkers to be most predictive, however, best performance was obtained when complimenting the volume biomarkers with the intensity and texture features. Using all the biomarkers, accuracy of 86.2 % and 69.2 % was achieved for normal control-AD and sMCI-cMCI classification respectively. Survival analysis demonstrated that the majority of the biomarkers showed a noticeable impact on the AD conversion probability 4 years prior to conversion. Composite indices were the top performers for all analyses including feature importance, classification, and survival analysis. This demonstrated their ability to summarize various dimensions of disease into single-valued metrics. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) with phosphorylated-tau and amyloid-beta CSF biomarkers was found with all the FLAIR biomarkers. The proposed biomarker system is easily attained as FLAIR is routinely acquired, models are not computationally intensive and the results are explainable, thus making this pipeline easily integrated into clinical workflow.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; FLAIR MRI; Mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; tau Proteins; Disease Progression; Peptide Fragments,"Crystal, O; Maralani, PJ; Black, S; Fischer, C; Moody, AR; Khademi, A"
Innovative SALDI mass spectrometry analysis for Alzheimer's disease synthetic peptides detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is nowadays the prominent cause of senile dementia. This pathology is characterized by aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles in cells and by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Noteworthy, a phosphorylated protein (tau protein) and a peptide presenting two overlapping sequences of 40 or 42 residues named β-amyloid peptides 1-40 (Aβ 1-40) and 1-42 (Aβ 1-42), respectively, were related to such deleterious phenomena. Singularly, the neurotoxicity was primarily attributed to the amyloid peptide Aβ 1-42 form due to its capacity to fold into beta-sheets rendering it insoluble thus causing subsequent aggregation and accumulation in vivo. Regarding AD diagnosis relying on mass spectrometry, Aβ 1-42 and/or Aβ 1-40 were considered as relevant biomarkers being measured in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), blood and urine. Under that context, we aimed at implementing an innovative method to evidence the depletion of circulating Aβ 1-42 amyloid peptide compared to the shorter Aβ 1-40 form indicating a pathologic state. We investigated Surface-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SALDI-MS) in order to monitor the Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 ratio without any prior sample treatment or enrichment. Taking into account that β-amyloid peptide and 1-42 can aggregate into beta-sheets depending on the experimental conditions, specific attention was devoted to sample integrity monitoring performed by circular dichroism experiments during SALDI-MS method development.",2024,CD; Imaging MS; Nanoneedles; Nanowires; SALDI-MS; β-Amyloid peptides,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Plaque, Amyloid; Biomarkers","Cournut, A; Moustiez, P; Coffinier, Y; Enjalbal, C; Bich, C"
Associations between multimorbidity burden and Alzheimer's pathology in older adults without dementia: the CABLE study.,"Studies have shown that multimorbidity may be associated with the Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages, but it has not been fully characterized in patients without dementia. A total of 1402 Han Chinese older adults without dementia from Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study were included and grouped according to their multimorbidity patterns, defined by the number of chronic disorders and cluster analysis. Multivariable linear regression models were used to detect the associations with AD-related cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.

Comparison of CSF and plasma NfL and pNfH for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: a memory clinic study.,"Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising biomarker of axonal damage for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) has demonstrated its value in motor neuron diseases diagnosis, but has less been explored for dementia diagnosis. In a cross-sectional study, we compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma NfL and pNfH levels in n = 188 patients from Lariboisière Hospital, Paris, France, including AD patients at mild cognitive impairment stage (AD-MCI, n = 36) and dementia stage (n = 64), non-AD MCI (n = 38), non-AD dementia (n = 28) patients and control subjects (n = 22). Plasma NfL, plasma and CSF pNfH levels were measured using Simoa and CSF NfL using ELISA. The correlation between CSF and plasma levels was stronger for NfL than pNfH (rho = 0.77 and rho = 0.52, respectively). All neurofilament markers were increased in AD-MCI, AD dementia and non-AD dementia groups compared with controls. CSF NfL, CSF pNfH and plasma NfL showed high performance to discriminate AD at both MCI and dementia stages from control subjects [AUC (area under the curve) = 0.82-0.91]. Plasma pNfH displayed overall lower AUCs for discrimination between groups compared with CSF pNfH. Neurofilament markers showed similar moderate association with cognition. NfL levels displayed significant association with mediotemporal lobe atrophy and white matter lesions in the AD group. Our results suggest that CSF NfL and pNfH as well as plasma NfL levels display equivalent performance in both positive and differential AD diagnosis in memory clinic settings. In contrast to motoneuron disorders, plasma pNfH did not demonstrate added value as compared with plasma NfL.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Fluid biomarkers; Neurofilament; Neurofilament light; Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy; Plasma biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Motor Neuron Disease; Nervous System Diseases; Neurofilament Proteins; tau Proteins,"Vrillon, A; Ashton, NJ; Karikari, TK; Götze, K; Cognat, E; Dumurgier, J; Lilamand, M; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Paquet, C"

CSF biomarker analysis of ABCA7 mutation carriers suggests altered APP processing and reduced inflammatory response.,"The Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene ABCA7 has suggested functions in lipid metabolism and the immune system. Rare premature termination codon (PTC) mutations and an expansion of a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in the gene, both likely cause a lower ABCA7 expression and hereby increased risk for AD.

Chiral nanoparticle-remodeled gut microbiota alleviates neurodegeneration via the gut-brain axis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β accumulation in the brain and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation, as well as neuroinflammation. The gut-brain axis has emerged as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases by modulating metabolic activity, neuroimmune functions and sensory neuronal signaling. Here we investigate interactions between orally ingested chiral Au nanoparticles and the gut microbiota in AD mice. Oral administration of chiral Au nanoparticles restored cognitive abilities and ameliorated amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau pathologies in AD mice via alterations in the gut microbiome composition and an increase in the gut metabolite, indole-3-acetic acid, which was lower in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD compared with age-matched controls. Oral administration of indole-3-acetic acid was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and alleviated cognitive decline and pathology including neuroinflammation in AD mice.

Cholesterol 24-hydroxylase at the choroid plexus contributes to brain immune homeostasis.,"The choroid plexus (CP) plays a key role in remotely controlling brain function in health, aging, and disease. Here, we report that CP epithelial cells express the brain-specific cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) and that its levels are decreased under different mouse and human brain conditions, including amyloidosis, aging, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using primary mouse CP cell cultures, we demonstrate that the enzymatic product of CYP46A1, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, downregulates inflammatory transcriptomic signatures within the CP, found here to be elevated across multiple neurological conditions. In vitro, the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) downregulates CYP46A1 expression, while overexpression of CYP46A1 or its pharmacological activation in mouse CP organ cultures increases resilience to TNF-α. In vivo, overexpression of CYP46A1 in the CP in transgenic mice with amyloidosis is associated with better cognitive performance and decreased brain inflammation. Our findings suggest that CYP46A1 expression in the CP impacts the role of this niche as a guardian of brain immune homeostasis.",2023,24-OH; Alzheimer’s disease; COVID-19; CYP46A1; TNF-α; blood-CSF barrier; inflammation; neurodegeneration aging,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Cholesterol 24-Hydroxylase; Choroid Plexus; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Brain; Homeostasis; Mice, Transgenic; Amyloidosis","Tsitsou-Kampeli, A; Suzzi, S; Kenigsbuch, M; Satomi, A; Strobelt, R; Singer, O; Feldmesser, E; Purnapatre, M; Colaiuta, SP; David, E; Cahalon, L; Hahn, O; Wyss-Coray, T; Shaul, Y; Amit, I; Schwartz, M"
"Longitudinal clinical, cognitive and biomarker profiles in dominantly inherited versus sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease.","Approximately 5% of Alzheimer's disease cases have an early age at onset (<65 years), with 5-10% of these cases attributed to dominantly inherited mutations and the remainder considered as sporadic. The extent to which dominantly inherited and sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease overlap is unknown. In this study, we explored the clinical, cognitive and biomarker profiles of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, focusing on commonalities and distinctions between dominantly inherited and sporadic cases. Our analysis included 117 participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and 118 individuals with sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease enrolled at the University of California San Francisco Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.

sTREM2 is associated with attenuated tau aggregate accumulation in the presence of amyloid-β pathology.,"Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cell 2 (TREM2) plays a crucial role in the transition of microglia from a state of homeostasis to a state associated with the disease. Mutations in TREM2 are strongly linked with a higher risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. There have been contradictory findings regarding the potential detrimental or protective effects of microglial activation and TREM2-related microglial responses in Alzheimer's disease. Although previous studies reported increased CSF soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in different clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, the exact association between Alzheimer's disease hallmarks such as amyloid-beta and tau pathology remains unclear. In the present study, I aimed to investigate the association between TREM2-related microglial responses and tau accumulation in the presence and absence of amyloid-beta pathology in order to give a better view of the role of microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease development.

Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy: shared neuropathology guides current and future treatment strategies.,"Epilepsy is a cause of profound disability in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The risk of being diagnosed with AD increases the risk for epilepsy, and in parallel, a history of epilepsy increases the likelihood of the development of AD. This bi-directional relationship may be due to underlying shared pathophysiologic hallmarks, including decreased cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), increased hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and hippocampal hyperexcitability. Additionally, there are practical treatment considerations in patients with co-morbid AD and epilepsy-namely, there is a higher risk of seizures associated with medications commonly prescribed for Alzheimer's disease patients, including antidepressants and antipsychotics such as trazodone, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and first-generation neuroleptics. Anti-amyloid antibodies like aducanumab and lecanemab present new and unique considerations in patients with co-morbid AD and epilepsy given the risk of seizures associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) seen with this drug class. Finally, we identify and detail five active studies, including two clinical trials of levetiracetam in the respective treatment of cognition and neuropsychiatric features of AD, a study characterizing the prevalence of epilepsy in AD via prolonged EEG monitoring, a study characterizing AD biomarkers in late-onset epilepsy, and a study evaluating hyperexcitability in AD.

High burdens of phosphorylated tau protein and distinct precuneus atrophy in sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is a rare devastating subclassification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). EOAD affects individuals <65 years old, and accounts for 5%-10% of all AD cases. Previous studies on EOAD primarily focused on familial forms, whereas research on sporadic EOAD (sEOAD), which represents 85%-90% of EOAD cases, is limited. In this prospective cohort study, participants were recruited between 2018 and 2023 and included patients with sEOAD (n = 110), late-onset AD (LOAD, n = 89), young controls (YC, n = 50), and older controls (OC, n = 25). All AD patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria based on biomarker evidence. Familial EOAD patients or non-AD dementia patients were excluded. Single molecule array technology was used to measure fluid biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, phosphorylated tau (P-tau) 181, total tau (T-tau), serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Patients with sEOAD exhibited more severe executive function impairment and bilateral precuneus atrophy (P < 0.05, family-wise error corrected) than patients with LOAD. Patients with sEOAD showed elevated CSF and plasma P-tau181 levels (154.0 ± 81.2 pg/mL, P = 0.002; and 6.1 ± 2.3 pg/mL, P = 0.046). Moreover, precuneus atrophy was significantly correlated with serum GFAP levels in sEOAD (P < 0.001). Serum GFAP levels (area under the curve (AUC) = 96.0%, cutoff value = 154.3 pg/mL) displayed excellent diagnostic value in distinguishing sEOAD patients from the control group.

Differential patterns of lysosomal dysfunction are seen in the clinicopathological forms of primary progressive aphasia.,"Increasing evidence implicates endo-lysosomal dysfunction in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 18 proteins were quantified using a mass spectrometry assay panel in the cerebrospinal fluid of 36 people with the language variant of FTD, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) (including 13 with non-fluent variant (nfvPPA), 11 with semantic variant (svPPA), and 12 with logopenic variant (lvPPA)) and 19 healthy controls. The concentrations of the cathepsins (B, D, F, L1, and Z) as well as AP-2 complex subunit beta, ganglioside GM2 activator, beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta, tissue alpha L-fucosidase, and ubiquitin were decreased in nfvPPA compared with controls. In contrast, the concentrations of amyloid beta A4 protein, cathepsin Z, and dipeptidyl peptidase 2 were decreased in svPPA compared with controls. No proteins were abnormal in lvPPA.

"Piezo1 agonist restores meningeal lymphatic vessels, drainage, and brain-CSF perfusion in craniosynostosis and aged mice.","Skull development coincides with the onset of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, brain-CSF perfusion, and meningeal lymphangiogenesis, processes essential for brain waste clearance. How these processes are affected by craniofacial disorders such as craniosynostosis are poorly understood. We report that raised intracranial pressure and diminished CSF flow in craniosynostosis mouse models associate with pathological changes to meningeal lymphatic vessels that affect their sprouting, expansion, and long-term maintenance. We also show that craniosynostosis affects CSF circulatory pathways and perfusion into the brain. Further, craniosynostosis exacerbates amyloid pathology and plaque buildup in Twist1+/-:5xFAD transgenic Alzheimer's disease models. Treating craniosynostosis mice with Yoda1, a small molecule agonist for Piezo1, reduces intracranial pressure and improves CSF flow, in addition to restoring meningeal lymphangiogenesis, drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes, and brain-CSF perfusion. Leveraging these findings, we show that Yoda1 treatments in aged mice with reduced CSF flow and turnover improve lymphatic networks, drainage, and brain-CSF perfusion. Our results suggest that CSF provides mechanical force to facilitate meningeal lymphatic growth and maintenance. Additionally, applying Yoda1 agonist in conditions with raised intracranial pressure and/or diminished CSF flow, as seen in craniosynostosis or with ageing, is a possible therapeutic option to help restore meningeal lymphatic networks and brain-CSF perfusion.",2023,Genetic diseases; Mouse models; Neuroscience; Vascular Biology,Mice; Animals; Glymphatic System; Brain; Lymphatic Vessels; Perfusion; Craniosynostoses; Drainage; Ion Channels,"Matrongolo, MJ; Ang, PS; Wu, J; Jain, A; Thackray, JK; Reddy, A; Sung, CC; Barbet, G; Hong, YK; Tischfield, MA"

Sex modifies effects of imaging and CSF biomarkers on cognitive and functional outcomes: a study of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and functional impairments. Two of 3 patients with AD are biologically female; therefore, the biological underpinnings of this diagnosis disparity may inform interventions slowing the AD progression. To bridge this gap, we conducted analyses of 1078 male and female participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to examine associations between levels of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)/neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive/functional outcomes. The Chow test was used to quantify sex differences by determining if biological sex affects relationships between the studied biomarkers and outcomes. Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (whole brain, entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, hippocampus), position emission tomography (AV45), and CSF (P-TAU, TAU) biomarkers were differentially associated with cognitive and functional outcomes. Post-hoc bootstrapped and association analyses confirmed these differential effects and emphasized the necessity of using separate, sex-stratified models. The studied imaging/CSF biomarkers may account for some of the sex-based variation in AD pathophysiology.

Peripheral Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of YKL-40 in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is particularly complicated, and early diagnosis and course monitoring of the disease are not ideal based on the available core biomarkers. As a biomarker closely related to neuroinflammation, YKL-40 provides a potential scalable approach in AD, but its association remains controversial and inconclusive with AD. We conducted this study to assess the utility of YKL-40 levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) by meta-analysis. We systematically searched and screened relevant trials for comparing YKL-40 levels between AD patients and HCs in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a search deadline of 14 March 2023 for each database. A total of 17 eligible and relevant studies involving 1811 subjects, including 949 AD patients and 862 HCs, were included. The results showed that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral blood of AD patients and HCs did not possess significant differences.

Bulat-Klarica-Oreskovic Hypothesis: A Comprehensive Review.,"Classical theories of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and flow are taught throughout medical education. The idea that CSF is produced and/or filtered by the choroid plexus and flows in one direction throughout the ventricular system has been a largely accepted thesis. However, modern studies have called into question the validity of this hypothesis, suggesting that CSF does not move unidirectionally but rather is driven by microvessel contractions in a to-and-fro manner throughout the cerebrospinal system. Moreover, new insights suggest that in addition to CSF production, the exchange of fluids and proteins between the cortical vasculature and the interstitium may function as the brain's version of a lymphatic system. This comprehensive review provides evidence for a different framework of CSF flow. One that includes perivascular pulsations that push CSF back and forth, allowing exchange between the CSF and interstitium, and with CSF production occurring throughout the cerebrospinal system. These findings could be revolutionary in understanding the pathophysiology of CSF flow and in the treatment of pathologies such as intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, Alzheimer's disease, and many others.",2023,cerebrospinal fluid; cerebrospinal fluid pathophysiology; csf dynamics; glymphatics; hydrocephalus; intracranial hypertension; lymphatics of the brain,,"Bajda, J; Pitla, N; Gorantla, VR"

We therefore tested the performance of these plasma biomarkers in 126 participants with preclinical AD and 123 controls with 8-10 years of follow-up from the China Cognition and Aging Study. Plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL were significantly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid counterparts and significantly altered in participants with preclinical AD. Combining plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL successfully discriminated preclinical AD from controls. These findings were validated in a replication cohort including 51 familial AD mutation carriers and 52 non-carriers from the Chinese Familial Alzheimer's Disease Network.

Soluble TREM2 ameliorates tau phosphorylation and cognitive deficits through activating transgelin-2 in Alzheimer's disease.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane protein that is predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain. The proteolytic shedding of TREM2 results in the release of soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), which is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It remains unknown whether sTREM2 regulates the pathogenesis of AD. Here we identified transgelin-2 (TG2) expressed on neurons as the receptor for sTREM2. The microglia-derived sTREM2 binds to TG2, induces RhoA phosphorylation at S188, and deactivates the RhoA-ROCK-GSK3β pathway, ameliorating tau phosphorylation. The sTREM2 (77-89) fragment, which is the minimal active sequence of sTREM2 to activate TG2, mimics the inhibitory effect of sTREM2 on tau phosphorylation. Overexpression of sTREM2 or administration of the active peptide rescues tau pathology and behavioral defects in the tau P301S transgenic mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that the sTREM2-TG2 interaction mediates the cross-talk between microglia and neurons. sTREM2 and its active peptide may be a potential therapeutic intervention for tauopathies including AD.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphorylation; Mice, Transgenic; Peptides; Cognition; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Membrane Glycoproteins; Receptors, Immunologic","Zhang, X; Tang, L; Yang, J; Meng, L; Chen, J; Zhou, L; Wang, J; Xiong, M; Zhang, Z"

Phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease.,"There is a need for blood biomarkers to detect individuals at different Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages because obtaining cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers is invasive and costly. Plasma phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau) have shown potential as such biomarkers. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), threonine 217 (p-tau217) and threonine 231 (p-tau231) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. All p-tau isoforms increase as a function of Aβ-accumulation and discriminate healthy individuals from those at preclinical AD stages with high accuracy. P-tau231 increases earliest, followed by p-tau181 and p-tau217. In advanced stages, all p-tau isoforms are associated with the clinical classification of AD and increase with disease severity, with the greatest increase seen for p-tau217. This is also reflected by a better correlation of p-tau217 with Aβ scans, whereas both, p-tau217 and p-tau181 correlated equally with tau scans. However, at the very advanced stages, p-tau181 begins to plateau, which may mirror the trajectory of the Aβ pathology and indicate an association with a more intermediate risk of AD. Across the AD continuum, the incremental increase in all biomarkers is associated with structural changes in widespread brain regions and underlying cognitive decline. Furthermore, all isoforms differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, making them specific for AD. Incorporating p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in clinical use requires further studies to examine ideal cut-points and harmonize assays.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; P-tau181; P-tau217; P-tau231; Phosphorylated tau; Plasma,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Protein Isoforms; tau Proteins; Threonine,"Telser, J; Grossmann, K; Wohlwend, N; Risch, L; Saely, CH; Werner, P"

Considerations for Use of Blood-Based Biomarkers in Epidemiologic Dementia Research.,"Dementia represents a growing public health burden with large social, racial, and ethnic disparities. The etiology of dementia is poorly understood, and the lack of robust biomarkers in diverse, population-representative samples is a barrier to moving dementia research forward. Existing biomarkers and other measures of pathology-derived from neuropathology, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid samples-are commonly collected from predominantly White and highly educated samples drawn from academic medical centers in urban settings. Blood-based biomarkers are noninvasive and less expensive, offering promise to expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of dementia, including in participants from historically excluded groups. Although largely not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration or used in clinical settings, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly included in epidemiologic studies on dementia. Blood-based biomarkers in epidemiologic research may allow the field to more accurately understand the multifactorial etiology and sequence of events that characterize dementia-related pathophysiological changes. As blood-based dementia biomarkers continue to be developed and incorporated into research and practice, we outline considerations for using them in dementia epidemiology, and illustrate key concepts with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (2003-present) data. We focus on measurement, including both validity and reliability, and on the use of dementia blood-based biomarkers to promote equity in dementia research and cognitive aging.

Systematic review: fluid biomarkers and machine learning methods to improve the diagnosis from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered an early stage of dementia, with estimated rates of progression to dementia up to 80-90% after approximately 6 years from the initial diagnosis. Diagnosis of cognitive impairment in dementia is typically based on clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessments, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The main goal of diagnosing MCI is to determine its cause, particularly whether it is due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, only a limited percentage of the population has access to etiological confirmation, which has led to the emergence of peripheral fluid biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for dementias, including MCI due to AD. Recent advances in biofluid assays have enabled the use of sophisticated statistical models and multimodal machine learning (ML) algorithms for the diagnosis of MCI based on fluid biomarkers from CSF, peripheral blood, and saliva, among others. This approach has shown promise for identifying specific causes of MCI, including AD. After a PRISMA analysis, 29 articles revealed a trend towards using multimodal algorithms that incorporate additional biomarkers such as neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and genetic information. Particularly, neuroimaging is commonly used in conjunction with fluid biomarkers for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our systematic review suggests that cost-effective longitudinal multimodal monitoring data, representative of diverse cultural populations and utilizing white-box ML algorithms, could be a valuable contribution to the development of diagnostic models for AD due to MCI. Clinical assessment and biomarkers, together with ML techniques, could prove pivotal in improving diagnostic tools for MCI due to AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Fluid biomarker; Machine learning; Mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Machine Learning; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Blanco, K; Salcidua, S; Orellana, P; Sauma-Pérez, T; León, T; Steinmetz, LCL; Ibañez, A; Duran-Aniotz, C; de la Cruz, R"

The Role of Adipokines in the Pathologies of the Central Nervous System.,"Adipokines are protein hormones secreted by adipose tissue in response to disruptions in physiological homeostasis within the body's systems. The regulatory functions of adipokines within the central nervous system (CNS) are multifaceted and intricate, and they have been identified in a number of pathologies. Therefore, specific adipokines have the potential to be used as biomarkers for screening purposes in neurological dysfunctions. The systematic review presented herein focuses on the analysis of the functions of various adipokines in the pathogenesis of CNS diseases. Thirteen proteins were selected for analysis through scientific databases. It was found that these proteins can be identified within the cerebrospinal fluid either by their ability to modify their molecular complex and cross the blood-brain barrier or by being endogenously produced within the CNS itself. As a result, this can correlate with their measurability during pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, depression, or brain tumors.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; adipokines; adipose tissue; depression; encephalitis; meningitis; multiple sclerosis; neurological dysfunctions; protein hormones,Humans; Adipokines; Central Nervous System; Alzheimer Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Adipose Tissue,"Huber, K; Szerenos, E; Lewandowski, D; Toczylowski, K; Sulik, A"

"Clinical, imaging, and biomarker evidence of amyloid- and tau-related neurodegeneration in late-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology.","Accumulating evidence suggests amyloid and tau-related neurodegeneration may play a role in development of late-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology (LOEU). In this article, we review recent evidence that epilepsy may be an initial manifestation of an amyloidopathy or tauopathy that precedes development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with LOEU demonstrate an increased risk of cognitive decline, and patients with AD have increased prevalence of preceding epilepsy. Moreover, investigations of LOEU that use CSF biomarkers and imaging techniques have identified preclinical neurodegeneration with evidence of amyloid and tau deposition. Overall, findings to date suggest a relationship between acquired, non-lesional late-onset epilepsy and amyloid and tau-related neurodegeneration, which supports that preclinical or prodromal AD is a distinct etiology of late-onset epilepsy.

Overestimation in angular path integration precedes Alzheimer's dementia.,"Path integration (PI) is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but reflects multiple sub-processes that may be differentially sensitive to AD. To characterize these sub-processes, we developed a novel generative linear-angular model of PI (GLAMPI) to fit the inbound paths of healthy elderly participants performing triangle completion, a popular PI task, in immersive virtual reality with real movement. The model fits seven parameters reflecting the encoding, calculation, and production errors associated with inaccuracies in PI. We compared these parameters across younger and older participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), including those with (MCI+) and without (MCI-) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD neuropathology. MCI patients showed overestimation of the angular turn in the outbound path and more variable inbound distances and directions compared with healthy elderly. MCI+ were best distinguished from MCI- patients by overestimation of outbound turns and more variable inbound directions. Our results suggest that overestimation of turning underlies the PI errors seen in patients with early AD, indicating specific neural pathways and diagnostic behaviors for further research.",2023,cognitive neuroscience; computational modeling; entorhinal cortex; grid cells; mild cognitive impairment; navigation; virtual reality,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Castegnaro, A; Ji, Z; Rudzka, K; Chan, D; Burgess, N"

Readthrough isoform of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease and other proteinopathies.,"The glymphatic system is a crucial component in preserving brain homeostasis by facilitating waste clearance from the central nervous system (CNS). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels facilitate the continuous interchange between cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid by convective flow movement. This flow is responsible for guiding proteins and metabolites away from the CNS. Proteinopathies are neurological conditions characterized by the accumulation of aggregated proteins or peptides in the brain. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides causes the formation of senile plaques. This accumulation has been hypothesized to be a result of the imbalance between Aβ production and clearance. Recent studies have shown that an extended form of AQP4 increases Aβ clearance from the brain. In this mini-review, we present a summary of these findings and explore the potential for future therapeutic strategies aiming to boost waste clearance in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s; Aquaporin-4; Protein aggregation; Proteinopathies; Therapeutic target; Waste clearance,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Aquaporin 4; Brain; Protein Isoforms; Proteostasis Deficiencies,"Mohaupt, P; Vialaret, J; Hirtz, C; Lehmann, S"

Practice makes imperfect: stronger implicit interference with practice in individuals at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.,"Early screening to determine patient risk of developing Alzheimer's will allow better interventions and planning but necessitates accessible methods such as behavioral biomarkers. Previously, we showed that cognitively healthy older individuals whose cerebrospinal fluid amyloid/tau ratio indicates high risk of cognitive decline experienced implicit interference during a high-effort task, signaling early changes in attention. To further investigate attention's effect on implicit interference, we analyzed two experiments completed sequentially by the same high- and low-risk individuals. We hypothesized that if attention modulates interference, practice would affect the influence of implicit distractors. Indeed, while both groups experienced a strong practice effect, the association between practice and interference effects diverged between groups: stronger practice effects correlated with more implicit interference in high-risk participants, but less interference in low-risk individuals. Furthermore, low-risk individuals showed a positive correlation between implicit interference and EEG low-range alpha event-related desynchronization when switching from high- to low-load tasks. This suggests that lower attention on the task was correlated with stronger interference, a typical phenomenon in the younger population. These results demonstrate how attention impacts implicit interference and highlight early differences in perception between high- and low-risk individuals.",2024,Aging; Implicit processing; Practice; Pre-symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Hung, SM; Adams, SW; Molloy, C; Wu, DA; Shimojo, S; Arakaki, X"

Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption by NPTX2 loss of function.,"Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is commonly observed in aging, especially in individuals who experience progressive cognitive decline to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, precise molecular mechanisms underlying the association between SCRD and aging are not fully understood. Orexin A is a well-characterized ""sleep neuropeptide"" that is expressed in hypothalamic neurons and evokes wake behavior. The importance of Orexin is exemplified in narcolepsy where it is profoundly down-regulated. Interestingly, the synaptic immediate early gene NPTX2 is co-expressed in Orexin neurons and is similarly reduced in narcolepsy. NPTX2 is also down-regulated in CSF of some cognitively normal older individuals and predicts the time of transition from normal cognition to MCI. The association between Orexin and NPTX2 is further evinced here where we observe that Orexin A and NPTX2 are highly correlated in CSF of cognitively normal aged individuals and raises the question of whether SCRD that are typically attributed to Orexin A loss of function may be modified by concomitant NPTX2 down-regulation. Is NPTX2 an effector of sleep or simply a reporter of orexin-dependent SCRD? To address this question, we examined NPTX2 KO mice and found they retain Orexin expression in the brain and so provide an opportunity to examine the specific contribution of NPTX2 to SCRD. Our results reveal that NPTX2 KO mice exhibit a disrupted circadian onset time, coupled with increased activity during the sleep phase, suggesting difficulties in maintaining states. Sleep EEG indicates distinct temporal allocation shifts across vigilance states, characterized by reduced wake and increased NREM time. Evident sleep fragmentation manifests through alterations of event occurrences during Wake and NREM, notably during light transition periods, in conjunction with an increased frequency of sleep transitions in NPTX2 KO mice, particularly between Wake and NREM. EEG spectral analysis indicated significant shifts in power across various frequency bands in the wake, NREM, and REM states, suggestive of disrupted neuronal synchronicity. An intriguing observation is the diminished occurrence of sleep spindles, one of the earliest measures of human sleep disruption, in NPTX2 KO mice. These findings highlight the effector role of NPTX2 loss of function as an instigator of SCRD and a potential mediator of sleep disruption in aging.",2023,,,"Roh, SE; Xiao, M; Delgado, A; Kwak, C; Savonenko, A; Bakker, A; Kwon, HB; Worley, P"

A new perspective on Alzheimer's disease: microRNAs and circular RNAs.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) play a multifaceted role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). miRNAs regulate several aspects of the disease, such as Aβ metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic function. The dynamic interaction between miRNAs and their target genes depends upon various factors, including the subcellular localization of miRNAs, the relative abundance of miRNAs and target mRNAs, and the affinity of miRNA-mRNA interactions. The miRNAs are released into extracellular fluids and subsequently conveyed to specific target cells through various modes of transportation, such as exosomes. In comparison, circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNA (ncRNA) characterized by their covalently closed continuous loops. In contrast to linear RNA, RNA molecules are circularized by forming covalent bonds between the 3'and 5'ends. CircRNA regulates gene expression through interaction with miRNAs at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, even though their precise functions and mechanisms of gene regulation remain to be elucidated. The current stage of research on miRNA expression profiles for diagnostic purposes in complex disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is still in its early phase, primarily due to the intricate nature of the underlying pathological causes, which encompass a diverse range of pathways and targets. Hence, this review comprehensively addressed the alteration of miRNA expression across diverse sources such as peripheral blood, exosome, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain in AD patients. This review also addresses the nascent involvement of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD and their prospective utility as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for these conditions in future research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; circular RNA; microRNA; neurodegenerative disease,,"Abidin, SZ; Mat Pauzi, NA; Mansor, NI; Mohd Isa, NI; Hamid, AA"

Breast-to-brain metastasis is exacerbated with chemotherapy through blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and induces Alzheimer's-like pathology.,"Control of breast-to-brain metastasis remains an urgent unmet clinical need. While chemotherapies are essential in reducing systemic tumor burden, they have been shown to promote non-brain metastatic invasiveness and drug-driven neurocognitive deficits through the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), independently. Now, in this study, we investigated the effect of chemotherapy on brain metastatic progression and promoting tumor-mediated NFT. Results show chemotherapies increase brain-barrier permeability and facilitate enhanced tumor infiltration, particularly through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). This is attributed to increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) which, in turn, mediates loss of Claudin-6 within the choroid plexus cells of the BCSFB. Importantly, increased MMP9 activity in the choroid epithelium following chemotherapy results in cleavage and release of Tau from breast cancer cells. This cleaved Tau forms tumor-derived NFT that further destabilize the BCSFB. Our results underline for the first time the importance of the BCSFB as a vulnerable point of entry for brain-seeking tumor cells post-chemotherapy and indicate that tumor cells themselves contribute to Alzheimer's-like tauopathy.",2023,CSF; blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier; brain metastasis; breast cancer; chemotherapy; tau,Humans; Female; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms,"Saatian, B; Deshpande, K; Herrera, R; Sedighi, S; Eisenbarth, R; Iyer, M; Das, D; Julian, A; Martirosian, V; Lowman, A; LaViolette, P; Remsik, J; Boire, A; Sankey, E; Fecci, PE; Shiroishi, MS; Chow, F; Hurth, K; Neman, J"

"Air pollution, glymphatic impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.","Epidemiological evidence demonstrates a link between air pollution exposure and the onset and progression of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, current understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is limited. This opinion article examines the hypothesis that air pollution-induced impairment of glymphatic clearance represents a crucial etiological event in the development of AD. Exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) leads to systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, increased metal load, respiratory and cardiovascular dysfunction, and sleep abnormalities. All these factors are known to reduce the efficiency of glymphatic clearance. Rescuing glymphatic function by restricting the impact of causative agents, and improving sleep and cardiovascular system health, may increase the efficiency of waste metabolite clearance and subsequently slow the progression of AD. In sum, we introduce air pollution-mediated glymphatic impairment as an important mechanistic factor to be considered when interpreting the etiology and progression of AD as well as its responsiveness to therapeutic interventions.",2023,CSF; aging; amyloid plaques; neurodegeneration; ultrafine particles,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Air Pollution; Particulate Matter; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Hussain, R; Graham, U; Elder, A; Nedergaard, M"
"Melatonin-mediated IGF-1/GLP-1 activation in experimental OCD rats: Evidence from CSF, blood plasma, brain and in-silico investigations.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts and behaviors. Our study uses a validated 8-OH-DPAT-induced experimental model of OCD in rodents. We focus on the modulatory effects of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which are linked to neurodevelopment and survival. Current research investigates melatonin, a molecule with neuroprotective properties and multiple functions. Melatonin has beneficial effects on various illnesses, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and depression, indicating its potential efficacy in treating OCD. In the present study, we employed two doses of melatonin, 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, demonstrating a dose-dependent effect on 8-OH-DPAT-induced rat changes. In addition, the melatonin antagonist luzindole 5 mg/kg was utilized to compare and validate the efficacy of melatonin. In-silico studies alsocontribute to understanding the activation of IGF-1/GLP-1 pathways by melatonin. Current research indicates restoring neurochemical measurements on various biological samples (brain homogenates, CSF, and blood plasma) and morphological and histological analyses. In addition, the current research seeks to increase understanding of OCD and investigate potential new treatment strategies. Therefore, it is evident from the aforementioned research that the protective effect of melatonin can serve as a strong basis for developing a new OCD treatment by upregulating IGF-1 and GLP-1 levels.

"Morphometric and Nanomechanical Screening of Peripheral Blood Cells with Atomic Force Microscopy for Label-Free Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.","Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are complex, multifactorial disorders with significant social and economic impact in today's society. NDDs are predicted to become the second-most common cause of death in the next few decades due to an increase in life expectancy but also to a lack of early diagnosis and mainly symptomatic treatment. Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic methods, there are yet no reliable biomarkers identifying the complex pathways contributing to these pathologies. The development of new approaches for early diagnosis and new therapies, together with the identification of non-invasive and more cost-effective diagnostic biomarkers, is one of the main trends in NDD biomedical research. Here we summarize data on peripheral biomarkers, biofluids (cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma), and peripheral blood cells (platelets (PLTs) and red blood cells (RBCs)), reported so far for the three most common NDDs-Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PLTs and RBCs, beyond their primary physiological functions, are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of biomarkers for NDDs. Special attention is given to the morphological and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and RBCs as biophysical markers for the three pathologies. Modifications of the surface nanostructure and morphometric and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and RBCs from patients with AD, PD, and ALS have been revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is currently experiencing rapid and widespread adoption in biomedicine and clinical medicine, in particular for early diagnostics of various medical conditions. AFM is a unique instrument without an analog, allowing the generation of three-dimensional cell images with extremely high spatial resolution at near-atomic scale, which are complemented by insights into the mechanical properties of cells and subcellular structures. Data demonstrate that AFM can distinguish between the three pathologies and the normal, healthy state. The specific PLT and RBC signatures can serve as biomarkers in combination with the currently used diagnostic tools. We highlight the strong correlation of the morphological and nanomechanical signatures between RBCs and PLTs in PD, ALS, and AD.",2023,atomic force microscopy; biomarkers; cell morphology; cell nanomechanics; neurodegenerative disorders; platelets; red blood cells,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Alzheimer Disease; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Blood Cells","Taneva, SG; Todinova, S; Andreeva, T"
Identification of Candidate Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease via Multiplex Cerebrospinal Fluid and Serum Proteomics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia among elderly people worldwide. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the optimal fluid source for AD biomarkers, while serum biomarkers are much more achievable. To search for novel diagnostic AD biomarkers, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of CSF and serum samples from AD and normal cognitive controls (NC). CSF and serum proteomes were analyzed via data-independent acquisition quantitative mass spectrometry. Our bioinformatic analysis was based on Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment. In comparison to the controls, 8 proteins were more abundant in AD CSF, and 60 were less abundant in AD CSF, whereas 55 proteins were more and 10 were less abundant in the serum samples. ATPase-associated activity for CSF and mitochondrial functions for CSF and serum were the most enriched GO terms of the DEPs. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the most significant pathways for the differentially expressed proteins were the N-glycan biosynthesis pathways. The area under the curve (AUC) values for CSF sodium-/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 (AT1B1), serglycin (SRGN), and thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, mitochondrial (PRDX3) were 0.867 (",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; bioinformatics analysis; differentially expressed proteins; proteomes,Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Proteomics; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Area Under Curve; Biomarkers,"Liu, P; Li, L; He, F; Meng, F; Liu, X; Su, Y; Su, X; Luo, B; Peng, G"

Alteration of Neural Network and Hippocampal Slice Activation through Exosomes Derived from 5XFAD Nasal Lavage Fluid.,"Exosomes, key mediators of intercellular transmission of pathogenic proteins, such as amyloid-beta and tau, significantly influence the progression and exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Present in a variety of biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, saliva, and nasal lavage fluid (NLF), exosomes underscore their potential as integral mediators of AD pathology. By serving as vehicles for disease-specific molecules, exosomes could unveil valuable insights into disease identification and progression. This study emphasizes the imperative to investigate the impacts of exosomes on neural networks to enhance our comprehension of intracerebral neuronal communication and its implications for neurological disorders like AD. After harvesting exosomes derived from NLF of 5XFAD mice, we utilized a high-density multielectrode array (HD-MEA) system, the novel technology enabling concurrent recordings from thousands of neurons in primary cortical neuron cultures and organotypic hippocampal slices. The ensuing results revealed a surge in neuronal firing rates and disoriented neural connectivity, reflecting the effects provoked by pathological amyloid-beta oligomer treatment. The local field potentials in the exosome-treated hippocampal brain slices also exhibited aberrant rhythmicity, along with an elevated level of current source density. While this research is an initial exploration, it highlights the potential of exosomes in modulating neural networks under AD conditions and endorses the HD-MEA as an efficacious tool for exosome studies.",2023,5XFAD; exosome; high-density multielectrode array; hippocampal slice; nasal lavage fluid; neural network,Mice; Animals; Exosomes; Nasal Lavage Fluid; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Hippocampus,"Kim, S; Jeon, J; Ganbat, D; Kim, T; Shin, K; Hong, S; Hong, J"
Advancements in the Application of Nanomedicine in Alzheimer's Disease: A Therapeutic Perspective.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects most people worldwide. AD is a complex central nervous system disorder. Several drugs have been designed to cure AD, but with low success rates. Because the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers are two barriers that protect the central nervous system, their presence has severely restricted the efficacy of many treatments that have been studied for AD diagnosis and/or therapy. The use of nanoparticles for the diagnosis and treatment of AD is the focus of an established and rapidly developing field of nanomedicine. Recent developments in nanomedicine have made it possible to effectively transport drugs to the brain. However, numerous obstacles remain to the successful use of nanomedicines in clinical settings for AD treatment. Furthermore, given the rapid advancement in nanomedicine therapeutics, better outcomes for patients with AD can be anticipated. This article provides an overview of recent developments in nanomedicine using different types of nanoparticles for the management and treatment of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood–brain barrier; nanomedicine; neurodegenerative disease; therapeutic agent,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Nanomedicine; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Central Nervous System; Brain,"Puranik, N; Yadav, D; Song, M"
Adipocyte-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles from Patients with Alzheimer Disease Carry miRNAs Predicted to Target the CREB Signaling Pathway in Neurons.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction, and progressive dementia. Midlife obesity increases the risk of developing AD. Adipocyte-derived small extracellular vesicles (ad-sEVs) have been implicated as a mechanism in several obesity-related diseases. We hypothesized that ad-sEVs from patients with AD would contain miRNAs predicted to downregulate pathways involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We isolated ad-sEVs from the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD and controls and compared miRNA expression profiles. We performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on differentially expressed miRNAs to identify highly interconnected clusters correlating with clinical traits. The WGCNA identified a module of differentially expressed miRNAs, in both the serum and CSF, that was inversely correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Within this module, miRNAs that downregulate CREB signaling in neurons were highly represented. These results demonstrate that miRNAs carried by ad-sEVs in patients with AD may downregulate CREB signaling and provide a potential mechanistic link between midlife obesity and increased risk of AD.",2023,EVs; adipose tissue; dementia; exosomes; obesity,"Humans; Adipocytes; Alzheimer Disease; Extracellular Vesicles; MicroRNAs; Neurons; Obesity; Plaque, Amyloid; Signal Transduction","Batabyal, RA; Bansal, A; Cechinel, LR; Authelet, K; Goldberg, M; Nadler, E; Keene, CD; Jayadev, S; Domoto-Reilly, K; Li, G; Peskind, E; Hashimoto-Torii, K; Buchwald, D; Freishtat, RJ"

A Multiplexed Urinary Biomarker Panel Has Potential for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using Targeted Proteomics and Machine Learning.,"As disease-modifying therapies are now available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), accessible, accurate and affordable biomarkers to support diagnosis are urgently needed. We sought to develop a mass spectrometry-based urine test as a high-throughput screening tool for diagnosing AD. We collected urine from a discovery cohort (n = 11) of well-characterised individuals with AD (n = 6) and their asymptomatic, CSF biomarker-negative study partners (n = 5) and used untargeted proteomics for biomarker discovery. Protein biomarkers identified were taken forward to develop a high-throughput, multiplexed and targeted proteomic assay which was tested on an independent cohort (n = 21). The panel of proteins identified are known to be involved in AD pathogenesis. In comparing AD and controls, a panel of proteins including MIEN1, TNFB, VCAM1, REG1B and ABCA7 had a classification accuracy of 86%. These proteins have been previously implicated in AD pathogenesis. This suggests that urine-targeted mass spectrometry has potential utility as a diagnostic screening tool in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s; biomarkers; diagnosis; machine learning; mass spectrometry; proteomics; urine,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Proteomics; Urinary Tract; Machine Learning; Biomarkers; Neoplasm Proteins; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,"Hällqvist, J; Pinto, RC; Heywood, WE; Cordey, J; Foulkes, AJM; Slattery, CF; Leckey, CA; Murphy, EC; Zetterberg, H; Schott, JM; Mills, K; Paterson, RW"

To address this issue, we measured cytokine and chemokine immunoreactivities in simultaneously obtained lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 39 patients including 18 with MCI or early AD and 21 normal controls using a 27-plex XMAP bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

T Lymphocytes and Their Potential Role in Dementia with Lewy Bodies.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia. People with DLB have an inferior prognosis compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the diseases overlap in their neuropathology and clinical syndrome. It is imperative that we enhance our understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of DLB. The impact of peripheral inflammation on the brain in dementia has been increasingly explored in recent years, with T lymphocyte recruitment into brain parenchyma identified in AD and Parkinson's disease. There is now a growing range of literature emerging on the potential role of innate and adaptive immune cells in DLB, including T lymphocytes. In this review, we examine the profile of T lymphocytes in DLB, focusing on studies of post-mortem brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and the blood compartment. We present an integrated viewpoint on the results of these studies by proposing how changes to the T lymphocyte profile in the brain and periphery may relate to each other.

Multilayered Bioorthogonal SERS Nanoprobes Selectively Aggregating in Human Fluids: A Smart Optical Assay for β-Amyloid Peptide Quantification.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurological condition characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral skill impairment, features that worsen with time. Early diagnosis will likely be the most effective therapy for Alzheimer's disease since it can ensure timely pharmacological treatments that can reduce the irreversible progression and delay the symptoms. Amyloid β-peptide 1-42 (Aβ (1-42)) is considered one of the key pathological AD biomarkers that is present in different biological fluids. However, Aβ (1-42) detection still relies on colorimetric and enzyme-linked immunoassays as the gold standard characterized by low accuracy or high costs, respectively. In this context, optical detection techniques based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) through advanced nanoconstructs are promising alternatives for the development of novel rapid and low-cost methods for the targeting of Aβ pathological biomarkers in fluids. Here, a multilayered nanoprobe constituted by bioorthogonal Raman reporters (RRs) embedded within two layers of gold nanoparticles (Au@RRs@AuNPs) has been developed and successfully validated for specific detection of Aβ (1-42) in the human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with sensitivity down to pg/mL. The smart double-layer configuration enables us to exploit the outer gold NP surfaces for selective absorption of targeted peptide whose concentration controls the aggregation behavior of Au@RRs@AuNPs, proportionally reflected in Raman intensity changes, providing high specificity and sensitivity and representing a significant step ahead of the state of the art on SERS for clinical analyses.",2023,Aβ (1−42) peptides; SERS-based sensors; bioorthogonal Raman; cerebrospinal fluid; multilayered nanoparticles; neurodegenerative biomarker,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Biomarkers,"Dallari, C; Lenci, E; Trabocchi, A; Bessi, V; Bagnoli, S; Nacmias, B; Credi, C; Pavone, FS"
Magneto-assisted enzymatic DNA walkers for simultaneous electrochemical detection of amyloid-beta oligomers and Tau.,"DNA walkers have been widely explored and applied as biosensor elements to detect disease-related biomarkers. Traditional interface-anchored DNA walkers typically have a fixed swing arm range and an orientation of the preset track, which might complicate the design of a sensor system and limit its application in more scenes. We propose a simple electrochemical aptasensor to accurately detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on a nicking enzyme-powered DNA walker. In this method, bifunctional magnetic nanoparticles are used to identify and capture Aβ oligomers (AβO) and Tau and release the DNA walker. As the DNA walker moves freely on the surface of the electrode, the nicking enzymes circularly cleave and release the two signal substrate chains, significantly amplifying the signal. It has been demonstrated that the constructed sensor can sensitively detect AβO and Tau, and the combined analysis of dual markers improves the accuracy of AD diagnosis. Furthermore, this method can distinguish normal individuals from AD patients in real cerebrospinal fluid samples. The excellent performance of this biosensor makes it promising for clinical applications in diagnosing AD patients and prognosis assessment.",2023,,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Biosensing Techniques; DNA; Nanoparticles,"Cheng, T; Yuan, H; Dong, Y; Xu, S; Wang, G; Zhao, M; Jiao, J; Jiao, J"
Advances in Amyloid-β Clearance in the Brain and Periphery: Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"This review examines the role of impaired amyloid-β clearance in the accumulation of amyloid-β in the brain and the periphery, which is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The molecular mechanism underlying amyloid-β accumulation is largely unknown, but recent evidence suggests that impaired amyloid-β clearance plays a critical role in its accumulation. The review provides an overview of recent research and proposes strategies for efficient amyloid-β clearance in both the brain and periphery. The clearance of amyloid-β can occur through enzymatic or non-enzymatic pathways in the brain, including neuronal and glial cells, blood-brain barrier, interstitial fluid bulk flow, perivascular drainage, and cerebrospinal fluid absorption-mediated pathways. In the periphery, various mechanisms, including peripheral organs, immunomodulation/immune cells, enzymes, amyloid-β-binding proteins, and amyloid-β-binding cells, are involved in amyloid-β clearance. Although recent findings have shed light on amyloid-β clearance in both regions, opportunities remain in areas where limited data is available. Therefore, future strategies that enhance amyloid-β clearance in the brain and/or periphery, either through central or peripheral clearance approaches or in combination, are highly encouraged. These strategies will provide new insight into the disease pathogenesis at the molecular level and explore new targets for inhibiting amyloid-β deposition, which is central to the pathogenesis of sporadic AD (amyloid-β in parenchyma) and CAA (amyloid-β in blood vessels).",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Amyloid-β clearance; Brain and periphery; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA),,"Ullah, R; Lee, EJ"
Tau: a biomarker of Huntington's disease.,"Developing effective treatments for patients with Huntington's disease (HD)-a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe cognitive, motor and psychiatric impairments-is proving extremely challenging. While the monogenic nature of this condition enables to identify individuals at risk, robust biomarkers would still be extremely valuable to help diagnose disease onset and progression, and especially to confirm treatment efficacy. If measurements of cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament levels, for example, have demonstrated use in recent clinical trials, other proteins may prove equal, if not greater, relevance as biomarkers. In fact, proteins such as tau could specifically be used to detect/predict cognitive affectations. We have herein reviewed the literature pertaining to the association between tau levels and cognitive states, zooming in on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury in which imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood samples have been interrogated or used to unveil a strong association between tau and cognition. Collectively, these areas of research have accrued compelling evidence to suggest tau-related measurements as both diagnostic and prognostic tools for clinical practice. The abundance of information retrieved in this niche of study has laid the groundwork for further understanding whether tau-related biomarkers may be applied to HD and guide future investigations to better understand and treat this disease.",2023,,Humans; Huntington Disease; tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Lepinay, E; Cicchetti, F"
Harnessing acoustic speech parameters to decipher amyloid status in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive functions. Currently, there are no effective treatments for AD, underscoring the importance of identifying individuals in the preclinical stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to enable early interventions. Among the neuropathological events associated with the onset of the disease is the accumulation of amyloid protein in the brain, which correlates with decreased levels of A",2023,Alzheimer's disease; automated pattern recognition; biomarkers; cerebrospinal fluid; early diagnosis; machine learning; mild cognitive impairment; speech acoustics,,"García-Gutiérrez, F; Marquié, M; Muñoz, N; Alegret, M; Cano, A; de Rojas, I; García-González, P; Olivé, C; Puerta, R; Orellana, A; Montrreal, L; Pytel, V; Ricciardi, M; Zaldua, C; Gabirondo, P; Hinzen, W; Lleonart, N; García-Sánchez, A; Tárraga, L; Ruiz, A; Boada, M; Valero, S"
Global brain activity and its coupling with cerebrospinal fluid flow is related to tau pathology.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau deposition constitute Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Cortical tau deposits first in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus and then propagates to neocortex in an Aβ-dependent manner. Tau also tends to accumulate earlier in higher-order association cortex than in lower-order primary sensory-motor cortex. While previous research has examined the production and spread of tau, little attention has been paid to its clearance. Low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) global brain activity during the resting state is coupled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and potentially reflects glymphatic clearance. Here we report that tau deposition in subjects with evaluated Aβ, accompanied by cortical thinning and cognitive decline, is strongly associated with decreased coupling between CSF flow and global brain activity. Substantial modulation of global brain activity is also manifested as propagating waves of brain activation between higher- and lower-order regions, resembling tau spreading. Together, the findings suggest an important role of resting-state global brain activity in AD tau pathology.",2023,"cerebrospinal fluid flow; global resting-state fMRI signal; glymphatic system; high-order association regions; propagating wave of brain activity, Alzheimer’s disease pathology; tau deposition",,"Han, F; Lee, J; Chen, X; Ziontz, J; Ward, T; Landau, SM; Baker, SL; Harrison, TM; Jagust, WJ"
Direct Competition of ATCUN Peptides with Human Serum Albumin for Copper(II) Ions Determined by LC-ICP MS.,"Copper is an indispensable biometal, primarily serving as a redox-competent cofactor in numerous proteins. Apart from preformed copper-binding sites within the protein structures, small peptide motifs exist called ATCUN, which are composed of an N-terminal tripeptide XZH, able to bind Cu(II) ions in exchangeable form. These motifs are common for serum albumin, but they are also present in a wide range of proteins and peptides. These proteins and peptides can be involved in copper metabolism, and copper ions can affect their biological role. The distribution of copper between the ATCUN peptides, including truncated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides Aβ4-42 and Aβ11-42, which may be involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, is mainly determined by their concentrations and relative Cu(II)-binding affinities.

Soluble TREM2 triggers microglial dysfunction in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.,"Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation contributes to acute demyelination in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) in the CSF has been associated with microglial activation in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the basis for this immune-mediated attack and the pathophysiological role of sTREM2 in NMOSD remain to be elucidated. Here, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis and identified a genetic association between increased CSF sTREM2 and NMOSD risk. CSF sTREM2 was elevated in patients with NMOSD and was positively correlated with neural injury and other neuroinflammation markers. Single-cell RNA sequencing of human macrophage/microglia-like cells in CSF, a proxy for microglia, showed that increased CSF sTREM2 was positively associated with microglial dysfunction in patients with NMOSD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sTREM2 is a reliable biomarker of microglial activation in a mouse model of NMOSD. Using unbiased transcriptomic and lipidomic screens, we identified that excessive activation, overwhelmed phagocytosis of myelin debris, suppressed lipid metabolism and enhanced glycolysis underlie sTREM2-mediated microglial dysfunction, possibly through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling pathway. These molecular and cellular findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the genetic association between CSF sTREM2 and NMOSD risk and indicate that sTREM2 could be a potential biomarker of NMOSD progression and a therapeutic target for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.",2024,microglia; neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders; soluble TREM2,"Animals; Mice; Humans; Microglia; Alzheimer Disease; Neuromyelitis Optica; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Biomarkers; Membrane Glycoproteins; Receptors, Immunologic","Qin, C; Chen, M; Dong, MH; Yang, S; Zhang, H; You, YF; Zhou, LQ; Chu, YH; Tang, Y; Pang, XW; Wu, LJ; Tian, DS; Wang, W"
T cell exhaustion is associated with cognitive status and amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Studies over the last 100 years have suggested a link between inflammation, infectious disease, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Understanding how the immune system changes during the development of AD may facilitate new treatments. Here, we studied an aging cohort who had been assessed for AD pathology with amyloid positron emission tomography and cognitive testing, and conducted high dimensional flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear and cerebrospinal fluid cells. Participants were assigned a classification of being amyloid negative cognitively normal, amyloid positive cognitively normal (APCN), or amyloid positive mild cognitive impairment (APMCI), an early stage of AD. We observed major alterations in the peripheral innate immune system including increased myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the blood of APMCI participants.

The VCAM1-ApoE pathway directs microglial chemotaxis and alleviates Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), sensome receptor dysfunction impairs microglial danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) clearance and exacerbates disease pathology. Although extrinsic signals, including interleukin-33 (IL-33), can restore microglial DAMP clearance, it remains largely unclear how the sensome receptor is regulated and interacts with DAMP during phagocytic clearance. Here, we show that IL-33 induces VCAM1 in microglia, which promotes microglial chemotaxis toward amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque-associated ApoE, and leads to Aβ clearance. We show that IL-33 stimulates a chemotactic state in microglia, characterized by Aβ-directed migration. Functional screening identified that VCAM1 directs microglial Aβ chemotaxis by sensing Aβ plaque-associated ApoE. Moreover, we found that disrupting VCAM1-ApoE interaction abolishes microglial Aβ chemotaxis, resulting in decreased microglial clearance of Aβ. In patients with AD, higher cerebrospinal fluid levels of soluble VCAM1 were correlated with impaired microglial Aβ chemotaxis. Together, our findings demonstrate that promoting VCAM1-ApoE-dependent microglial functions ameliorates AD pathology.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Microglia; Interleukin-33; Chemotaxis; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoproteins E,"Lau, SF; Wu, W; Wong, HY; Ouyang, L; Qiao, Y; Xu, J; Lau, JH; Wong, C; Jiang, Y; Holtzman, DM; Fu, AKY; Ip, NY"
CSF-to-blood toxins clearance is modulated by breathing through cranio-spinal CSF oscillation.,"Clearance of brain toxins occurs during sleep, although the mechanism remains unknown. Previous studies implied that the intracranial aqueductal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oscillations are involved, but no mechanism was suggested. The rationale for focusing on the aqueductal CSF oscillations is unclear. This study focuses on the cranio-spinal CSF oscillation and the factors that modulate this flow. We propose a mechanism where increased cranio-spinal CSF movements enhance CSF-to-blood metabolic waste clearance through the spinal CSF re-absorption sites. A recent study demonstrating that disturbed sleep impairs CSF-to-blood but not brain-to-CSF clearance, supports the fundamentals of our proposed mechanism. Eight healthy subjects underwent phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the effect of respiration on the cranio-spinal CSF oscillations. Maximal CSF volume displaced from the cranium to the spinal canal during each respiration and cardiac cycle were derived as measures of cranio-spinal CSF mixing level. Transition from normal to slow and abdominal breathing resulted in a 56% increase in the maximal displaced CSF volume. Maximal change in the arterial-venous blood volume, which is the driving force of the CSF oscillations, was increased by 41% during slow abdominal breathing. Cranio-spinal CSF oscillations are driven by the momentary difference between arterial inflow and venous outflow. Breathing modulates the CSF oscillation through changes in the venous outflow. The amount of toxins being transferred to the spinal canal during each respiratory cycle is significantly increased during slow and deeper abdominal breathing, which explains enhanced CSF-to-blood toxins clearance during slow-wave sleep and poor clearance during disrupted sleep.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; CSF-to-blood toxins clearance; cerebral blood and CSF flows; phase-contrast MRI; respiration; sleep,Humans; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Respiration,"Burman, R; Alperin, N"
Alzheimer's disease: The role of T lymphocytes in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.,"Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of progressive cognitive decline globally, has been reported to be enhanced by neuroinflammation. Brain-resident innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells work together to produce neuroinflammation. Studies over the past decade have established the neuroimmune axis present in Alzheimer's disease; the crosstalk between adaptive and innate immune cells within and outside the brain is crucial to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although the role of the adaptive immune system in Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, it has been hypothesized that the brain's immune homeostasis is significantly disrupted, which greatly contributes to neuroinflammation. Brain-infiltrating T cells possess proinflammatory phenotypes and activities that directly contribute to neuroinflammation. The pro-inflammatory activities of the adaptive immune system in Alzheimer's disease are characterized by the upregulation of effector T cell activities and the downregulation of regulatory T cell activities in the brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. In this review, we discuss the major impact of T lymphocytes on the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the role and mechanism of action of T cells in Alzheimer's disease would significantly contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of the disease. This knowledge could also be crucial to the development of immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Microglia; Neurodegeneration; Neuroinflammation; T lymphocyte,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Microglia,"Asamu, MO; Oladipo, OO; Abayomi, OA; Adebayo, AA"

A computational study of fluid transport characteristics in the brain parenchyma of dementia subtypes.,"The cerebral environment is a complex system consisting of parenchymal tissue and multiple fluids. Dementia is a common class of neurodegenerative diseases, caused by structural damages and functional deficits in the cerebral environment. In order to better understand the pathology of dementia from a cerebral fluid transport angle and provide clearer evidence that could help differentiate between dementia subtypes, such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, we conducted fluid-structure interaction modelling of the brain using a multiple-network poroelasticity model, which considers both neuropathological and cerebrovascular factors. The parenchyma was further subdivided and labelled into parcellations to obtain more localised and detailed data. The numerical results were converted to computed functional images by an in-house workflow. Different cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance abnormalities were identified in the modelling results, when comparing Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

CSF proteome profiling reveals biomarkers to discriminate dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer´s disease.,"Diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is challenging and specific biofluid biomarkers are highly needed. We employed proximity extension-based assays to measure 665 proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with DLB (n = 109), Alzheimer´s disease (AD, n = 235) and cognitively unimpaired controls (n = 190). We identified over 50 CSF proteins dysregulated in DLB, enriched in myelination processes among others. The dopamine biosynthesis enzyme DDC was the strongest dysregulated protein, and could efficiently discriminate DLB from controls and AD (AUC:0.91 and 0.81 respectively). Classification modeling unveiled a 7-CSF biomarker panel that better discriminate DLB from AD (AUC:0.93). A custom multiplex panel for six of these markers (DDC, CRH, MMP-3, ABL1, MMP-10, THOP1) was developed and validated in independent cohorts, including an AD and DLB autopsy cohort. This DLB CSF proteome study identifies DLB-specific protein changes and translates these findings to a practicable biomarker panel that accurately identifies DLB patients, providing promising diagnostic and clinical trial testing opportunities.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Lewy Body Disease; Proteome; Autopsy; Biomarkers,"Del Campo, M; Vermunt, L; Peeters, CFW; Sieben, A; Hok-A-Hin, YS; Lleó, A; Alcolea, D; van Nee, M; Engelborghs, S; van Alphen, JL; Arezoumandan, S; Chen-Plotkin, A; Irwin, DJ; van der Flier, WM; Lemstra, AW; Teunissen, CE"

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative in the era of Alzheimer's disease treatment: A review of ADNI studies from 2021 to 2022.,"The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) aims to improve Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. Since 2006, ADNI has shared clinical, neuroimaging, and cognitive data, and biofluid samples. We used conventional search methods to identify 1459 publications from 2021 to 2022 using ADNI data/samples and reviewed 291 impactful studies. This review details how ADNI studies improved disease progression understanding and clinical trial efficiency. Advances in subject selection, detection of treatment effects, harmonization, and modeling improved clinical trials and plasma biomarkers like phosphorylated tau showed promise for clinical use. Biomarkers of amyloid beta, tau, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and others were prognostic with individualized prediction algorithms available online. Studies supported the amyloid cascade, emphasized the importance of neuroinflammation, and detailed widespread heterogeneity in disease, linked to genetic and vascular risk, co-pathologies, sex, and resilience. Biological subtypes were consistently observed.

Plasma MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio serves as a novel potential biomarker in Alzheimer's disease.,"This study aimed to explore the diagnostic potential of plasma MMP-9, TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This retrospective study was performed in a cohort consisting of patients with AD (AD group) and cognitive normal subjects (HC group). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) classic biomarkers including Aβ42, Aβ40, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels, and plasma MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were measured by commercially available ELISA kits, respectively. The differential diagnostic potential of plasma MMP-9, TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. It was observed that significantly elevated levels of plasma MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio in patients with AD than HC. Both MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios were negatively correlated with CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and positively correlated with CSF p-tau in AD group.

Biomarkers and Risk Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,"Dementia is a chronic syndrome which is common among the elderly and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality for patients and their caregivers. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of clinical dementia, is biologically characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The onset of AD begins decades before manifestation of symptoms and clinical diagnosis, underlining the need to shift from clinical diagnosis of AD to a more objective diagnosis using biomarkers. Having performed a literature search of original articles and reviews on PubMed and Google Scholar, we present this review detailing the existing biomarkers and risk assessment tools for AD. The prevalence of dementia in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is predicted to increase over the next couple of years. Thus, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers that may be appropriate for use in LMICs, considering the following factors: sensitivity, specificity, invasiveness, and affordability of the biomarkers. We also explored risk assessment tools and the potential use of artificial intelligence/machine learning solutions for diagnosing, assessing risks, and monitoring the progression of AD in low-resource settings. Routine use of AD biomarkers has yet to gain sufficient ground in clinical settings. Therefore, clinical diagnosis of AD will remain the mainstay in LMICs for the foreseeable future. Efforts should be made towards the development of low-cost, easily administered risk assessment tools to identify individuals who are at risk of AD in the population. We recommend that stakeholders invest in education, research and development targeted towards effective risk assessment and management.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; artificial intelligence; biomarkers; blood; cerebrospinal fluid; low- and middle-income countries; neuroimaging; risk,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Developing Countries; Artificial Intelligence; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Risk Assessment; tau Proteins,"Adewale, BA; Coker, MM; Ogunniyi, A; Kalaria, RN; Akinyemi, RO"

Rethinking the detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: Outcomes of a European Brain Council project.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative condition which robs people of their memory, their independence, their relationships and, ultimately, their lives. It affects close to 7 million people in the European Union (EU) alone. The detection and diagnosis of AD relies on a system that remains focused on the late stage of the disease, despite a better understanding of the disease progression. Clinical practice and healthcare systems' readiness to detect, diagnose and treat the disease effectively are still lagging. The use of biomarkers (cerebrospinal fluid tests (CSF) and positron emission tomography scans (PET)), which are central to a diagnostic assessment for people with AD symptoms, as well as relevant diagnostic facilities are under-utilised. PET imaging is expensive and of limited availability, and CSF sampling may be considered invasive. The European Brain Council's 'Rethinking Alzheimer's disease: Detection and diagnosis' White Paper has looked at the barriers to early diagnosis and how the healthcare systems infrastructure for detection and diagnosis of AD need to be transformed in order for people with AD to benefit from innovative solutions once they become approved for use.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Detection; Diagnosis; Preparedness,,"Dumas, A; Destrebecq, F; Esposito, G; Suchonova, D; Steen Frederiksen, K"

Tear Biomarkers and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder that represents the most common type of dementia. It poses a significant diagnostic challenge that requires timely recognition and treatment. Currently, there is no effective therapy for AD; however, certain medications may slow down its progression. The discovery of AD biomarkers, namely, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid molecules (amyloid-β and tau) has advanced our understanding of this disease and has been crucial for identifying early neuropathologic changes prior to clinical changes and cognitive decline. The close interrelationship between the eye and the brain suggests that tears could be an interesting source of biomarkers for AD; however, studies in this area are limited. The identification of biomarkers in tears will enable the development of cost-effective, non-invasive methods of screening, diagnosis and disease monitoring. In order to use tears as a standard method for early and non-invasive diagnosis of AD, future studies need to be conducted on a larger scale.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; dementia; early diagnosis; neurocognitive disorder; prognosis; tears,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Nerve Degeneration,"Kaštelan, S; Braš, M; Pjevač, N; Bakija, I; Tomić, Z; Pjevač Keleminić, N; Gverović Antunica, A"

From genetic correlations of Alzheimer's disease to classification with artificial neural network models.,"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder characterized by many risk loci with potential associations with different traits and diseases. AD, characterized by a progressive loss of neuronal functions, manifests with different symptoms such as decline in memory, movement, coordination, and speech. The mechanisms underlying the onset of AD are not always fully understood, but involve a multiplicity of factors. Early diagnosis of AD plays a central role as it can offer the possibility of early treatment, which can slow disease progression. Currently, the methods of diagnosis are cognitive testing, neuroimaging, or cerebrospinal fluid analysis that can be time-consuming, expensive, invasive, and not always accurate. In the present study, we performed a genetic correlation analysis using genome-wide association statistics from a large study of AD and UK Biobank, to examine the association of AD with other human traits and disorders. In addition, since hippocampus, a part of cerebral cortex could play a central role in several traits that are associated with AD; we analyzed the gene expression profiles of hippocampus of AD patients applying 4 different artificial neural network models. We found 65 traits correlated with AD grouped into 9 clusters: medical conditions, fluid intelligence, education, anthropometric measures, employment status, activity, diet, lifestyle, and sexuality. The comparison of different 4 neural network models along with feature selection methods on 5 Alzheimer's gene expression datasets showed that the simple basic neural network model obtains a better performance (66% of accuracy) than other more complex methods with dropout and weight regularization of the network.",2023,Alzheimer; Gene expression; Genetic correlation; Neural network,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Chromosome Mapping; Hippocampus; Neural Networks, Computer","Cava, C; D'Antona, S; Maselli, F; Castiglioni, I; Porro, D"

Alzheimer's disease biomarker profiling in a memory clinic cohort without common comorbidities.,"Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial disorder with large heterogeneity. Comorbidities such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes are known contributors to disease progression. However, less is known about their mechanistic contribution to Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of several biomarkers related to risk mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease with the well-established Alzheimer's disease markers in a memory clinic population without common comorbidities. We investigated 13 molecular markers representing key mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in CSF from memory clinic patients without diagnosed hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or diabetes nor other neurodegenerative disorders. An analysis of covariance was used to compare biomarker levels between clinical groups. Associations were analysed by linear regression. Two-step cluster analysis was used to determine patient clusters. Two key markers were analysed by immunofluorescence staining in the hippocampus of non-demented control and Alzheimer's disease individuals. CSF samples from a total of 90 participants were included in this study: 30 from patients with subjective cognitive decline (age 62.4 ± 4.38, female 60%), 30 with mild cognitive impairment (age 65.6 ± 7.48, female 50%) and 30 with Alzheimer's disease (age 68.2 ± 7.86, female 50%). Angiotensinogen, thioredoxin-1 and interleukin-15 had the most prominent associations with Alzheimer's disease pathology, synaptic and axonal damage markers. Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa and neurofilament light chain were increased in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients. Grouping biomarkers by biological function showed that inflammatory and survival components were associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology, synaptic dysfunction and axonal damage. Moreover, a vascular/metabolic component was associated with synaptic dysfunction. In the data-driven analysis, two patient clusters were identified: Cluster 1 had increased CSF markers of oxidative stress, vascular pathology and neuroinflammation and was characterized by elevated synaptic and axonal damage, compared with Cluster 2. Clinical groups were evenly distributed between the clusters. An analysis of post-mortem hippocampal tissue showed that compared with non-demented controls, angiotensinogen staining was higher in Alzheimer's disease and co-localized with phosphorylated-tau.

Interfacial Self-assembly of Chiral Selenide Nanomembrane for Enantiospecific Recognition.,"Here, we report the synthesis of chiral selenium nanoparticles (NPs) using cysteine and the interfacial assembly strategy to generate a self-assembled nanomembrane on a large-scale with controllable morphology and handedness. The selenide (Se) NPs exhibited circular dichroism (CD) bands in the ultraviolet and visible region with a maximum intensity of 39.96 mdeg at 388 nm and optical anisotropy factors (g-factors) of up to 0.0013 while a self-assembled monolayer nanomembrane exhibited symmetrical CD approaching 72.8 mdeg at 391 nm and g-factors up to 0.0034. Analysis showed that a photocurrent of 20.97±1.55 nA was generated by the D-nanomembrane when irradiated under light while the L-nanomembrane generated a photocurrent of 20.58±1.36 nA. Owing to the asymmetric intensity of the photocurrent with respect to the handedness of the nanomembrane, an ultrasensitive recognition of enantioselective kynurenine (Kyn) was achieved by the ten-layer (10L) D-nanomembrane exhibiting a photocurrent for L-kynurenine (L-Kyn) that was 8.64-fold lower than that of D-Kyn, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0074 nM for the L-Kyn, which was attributed to stronger affinity between L-Kyn and D-Se NPs.

[Sleep and dementia].,"Aging is associated with changes in sleep structure and cerebral deposition of amyloid beta and tau proteins. Sleep disturbances precede the onset of dementia by years. Comorbid sleep disorders, such as insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing, a family history of dementia and epigenetic factors can contribute to the development of dementia. This article explores the question of the interaction between sleep and dementia based on the existing literature. Alterations caused by slow wave sleep lead to changes in the glymphatic clearance of amyloid beta, tau proteins and other proteins. Transient and chronic sleep disorders cause disturbances in the brain areas responsible for cognition and behavior. Sleep-regulating brain areas are the first to be affected in the neurodegenerative process and accelerate the risk of dementia. Circadian age-related changes in amyloid beta and tau proteins affect the amount and depth of sleep and vice versa. Amyloid beta in cerebrospinal fluid shows an inverse correlation with sleep.

Neurodegeneration or dysfunction in Phelan-McDermid syndrome? A multimodal approach with CSF and computational MRI.,"Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a rare multisystem disease with global developmental delay and autistic features. Genetically, the disease is based on a heterozygous deletion of chromosome 22q13.3 with involvement of at least part of the SHANK3 gene or heterozygous pathogenic variants in SHANK3. Pathophysiologically, this syndrome has been regarded as a synaptopathy, but current data suggest an additional concept, since axonal functions of neurons are also impaired, thus, the specific pathophysiological processes in this disease are not yet fully understood. Since symptoms of the autism spectrum, regression, and stagnation in development occur, we investigated whether neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes may also play a role. To this end, we analysed biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and parameters from magnetic resonance imaging with high-resolution structural T1w volumetry and diffusion tensor imaging analysis in 19 Phelan-McDermid syndrome patients.",2023,Amyloid-ß; Cerebrospinal fluid; DTI; Dysfunction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegeneration; Phelan-McDermid syndrome; SHANK3; Tau-protein; White matter,Humans; tau Proteins; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Jesse, S; Müller, HP; Huppertz, HJ; Andres, S; Ludolph, AC; Schön, M; Boeckers, TM; Kassubek, J"

Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 protein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid are elevated in patients with first-episode psychosis.,The disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) protein is a key regulator at the intersection of major signaling pathways relevant for adaptive behavior. It is prone to posttranslational changes such as misassembly and aggregation but the significance of such transformations for human mental illness has remained unclear. We aimed to demonstrate the occurrence of DISC1 protein aggregates in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP).,2023,biomarker; cerebrospinal fluid; disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 protein; pathomechanisms; schizophrenia,Humans; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Protein Aggregates; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia,"Pils, M; Rutsch, J; Eren, F; Engberg, G; Piehl, F; Cervenka, S; Sellgren, C; Troßbach, S; Willbold, D; Erhardt, S; Bannach, O; Korth, C"
IL-34 exacerbates pathogenic features of Alzheimer's disease and calvaria osteolysis in triple transgenic (3x-Tg) female mice.,"Hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include elevated accumulation of aggregated Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides, hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), and neuroinflammation. Emerging evidence indicated that interleukin-34 (IL-34) contributes to AD and inflammatory osteolysis via the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1r). In addition, CSF-1r is also activated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (M-CSF). While the role of M-CSF in bone physiology and pathology is well addressed, it remains controversial whether IL-34-mediated signaling promotes osteolysis, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation in relation to AD. In this study, we injected 3x-Tg mice with mouse recombinant IL-34 protein over the calvaria bone every other day for 42 days. Then, behavioral changes, brain pathology, and calvaria osteolysis were evaluated using various behavioral maze and histological assays. We demonstrated that IL-34 administration dramatically elevated AD-like anxiety and memory loss, pathogenic amyloidogenesis, p-Tau, and RAGE expression in female 3x-Tg mice. Furthermore, IL-34 delivery promoted calvaria inflammatory osteolysis compared to the control group. In addition, we also compared the effects of IL-34 and M-CSF on macrophages, microglia, and RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis in relation to AD pathology in vitro. We observed that IL-34-exposed SIM-A9 microglia and 3x-Tg bone marrow-derived macrophages released significantly elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, compared to M-CSF treatment in vitro. Furthermore, IL-34, but not M-CSF, elevated RANKL-primed osteoclastogenesis in the presence of Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides in bone marrow derived macrophages isolated from female 3x-Tg mice. Collectively, our data indicated that IL-34 elevates AD-like features, including behavioral changes and neuroinflammation, as well as osteoclastogenesis in female 3x-Tg mice.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Cognitive behavior; Interleukin-34; Neuroinflammation; Osteolysis; RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis,"Animals; Female; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Animals, Genetically Modified; Interleukins; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Osteolysis; Skull","Ho, A; Ngala, B; Yamada, C; Garcia, C; Duarte, C; Akkaoui, J; Ciolac, D; Nusbaum, A; Kochen, W; Efremova, D; Groppa, S; Nathanson, L; Bissel, S; Oblak, A; Kacena, MA; Movila, A"

Preclinical Brain Network Abnormalities in Patients with Subjective Cognitive Decline.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. Currently there are no disease modifying treatments available. Detecting subjects with increased risk to develop dementia is essential for future clinical trials. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a condition defining individuals who perceive a decrease in their own cognitive functioning in the absence of any detectable deficit on neuropsychological testing.

The diamagnetic component map from quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) source separation reveals pathological alteration in Alzheimer's disease-driven neurodegeneration.,"A sensitive and accurate imaging technique capable of tracking the disease progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) driven amnestic dementia would be beneficial. A currently available method for pathology detection in AD with high accuracy is Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, despite certain limitations such as low spatial resolution, off-targeting error, and radiation exposure. Non-invasive MRI scanning with quantitative magnetic susceptibility measurements can be used as a complementary tool. To date, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has widely been used in tracking deep gray matter iron accumulation in AD. The present work proposes that by compartmentalizing quantitative susceptibility into paramagnetic and diamagnetic components, more holistic information about AD pathogenesis can be acquired. Particularly, diamagnetic component susceptibility (DCS) can be a powerful indicator for tracking protein accumulation in the gray matter (GM), demyelination in the white matter (WM), and relevant changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the current work, voxel-wise group analysis of the WM and the CSF regions show significantly lower |DCS| (the absolute value of DCS) value for amnestic dementia patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, |DCS| and τ PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) were found to be associated in several GM regions typically affected by τ deposition in AD. Therefore, we propose that the separated diamagnetic susceptibility can be used to track pathological neurodegeneration in different tissue types and regions of the brain. With the initial evidence, we believe the usage of compartmentalized susceptibility demonstrates substantive potential as an MRI-based technique for tracking AD-driven neurodegeneration.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; DECOMPOSE; Demyelination; Magnetic susceptibility; Neurodegeneration; Quantitative susceptibility mapping,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cerebral Cortex; Disease Progression; Gray Matter,"Ahmed, M; Chen, J; Arani, A; Senjem, ML; Cogswell, PM; Jack, CR; Liu, C"
Gaussian Process-based prediction of memory performance and biomarker status in ageing and Alzheimer's disease-A systematic model evaluation.,"Neuroimaging markers based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) combined with various other measures (such as genetic covariates, biomarkers, vascular risk factors, neuropsychological tests etc.) might provide useful predictions of clinical outcomes during the progression towards Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of multiple features in predictive frameworks for clinical outcomes has become increasingly prevalent in AD research. However, many studies do not focus on systematically and accurately evaluating combinations of multiple input features. Hence, the aim of the present work is to explore and assess optimal combinations of various features for MR-based prediction of (1) cognitive status and (2) biomarker positivity with a multi-kernel learning Gaussian process framework. The explored features and parameters included (A) combinations of brain tissues, modulation, smoothing, and image resolution; (B) incorporating demographics & clinical covariates; (C) the impact of the size of the training data set; (D) the influence of dimensionality reduction and the choice of kernel types. The approach was tested in a large German cohort including 959 subjects from the multicentric longitudinal study of cognitive impairment and dementia (DELCODE). Our evaluation suggests the best prediction of memory performance was obtained for a combination of neuroimaging markers, demographics, genetic information (ApoE4) and CSF biomarkers explaining 57% of outcome variance in out-of-sample predictions. The highest performance for Aβ42/40 status classification was achieved for a combination of demographics, ApoE4, and a memory score while usage of structural MRI further improved the classification of individual patient's pTau status.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Bayesian inference; Brain ageing; Brain morphology; Classification; Cognitive decline; Gaussian processes; Predictive modeling,,"Nemali, A; Vockert, N; Berron, D; Maas, A; Bernal, J; Yakupov, R; Peters, O; Gref, D; Cosma, N; Preis, L; Priller, J; Spruth, E; Altenstein, S; Lohse, A; Fliessbach, K; Kimmich, O; Vogt, I; Wiltfang, J; Hansen, N; Bartels, C; Schott, BH; Maier, F; Meiberth, D; Glanz, W; Incesoy, E; Butryn, M; Buerger, K; Janowitz, D; Pernecky, R; Rauchmann, B; Burow, L; Teipel, S; Kilimann, I; Göerß, D; Dyrba, M; Laske, C; Munk, M; Sanzenbacher, C; Müller, S; Spottke, A; Roy, N; Heneka, M; Brosseron, F; Roeske, S; Dobisch, L; Ramirez, A; Ewers, M; Dechent, P; Scheffler, K; Kleineidam, L; Wolfsgruber, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Duzel, E; Ziegler, G"

Analysis of clinical failure of anti-tau and anti-synuclein antibodies in neurodegeneration using a quantitative systems pharmacology model.,"Misfolded proteins in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease follow a well-defined connectomics-based spatial progression. Several anti-tau and anti-alpha synuclein (aSyn) antibodies have failed to provide clinical benefit in clinical trials despite substantial target engagement in the experimentally accessible cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The proposed mechanism of action is reducing neuronal uptake of oligomeric protein from the synaptic cleft. We built a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to quantitatively simulate intrasynaptic secretion, diffusion and antibody capture in the synaptic cleft, postsynaptic membrane binding and internalization of monomeric and oligomeric tau and aSyn proteins. Integration with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model allowed us to simulate clinical trials of anti-tau antibodies gosuranemab, tilavonemab, semorinemab, and anti-aSyn antibodies cinpanemab and prasineuzumab. Maximal target engagement for monomeric tau was simulated as 45% (semorinemab) to 99% (gosuranemab) in CSF, 30% to 99% in ISF but only 1% to 3% in the synaptic cleft, leading to a reduction of less than 1% in uptake of oligomeric tau. Simulations for prasineuzumab and cinpanemab suggest target engagement of free monomeric aSyn of only 6-8% in CSF, 4-6% and 1-2% in the ISF and synaptic cleft, while maximal target engagement of aggregated aSyn was predicted to reach 99% and 80% in the synaptic cleft with similar effects on neuronal uptake. The study generates optimal values of selectivity, sensitivity and PK profiles for antibodies. The study identifies a gradient of decreasing target engagement from CSF to the synaptic cleft as a key driver of efficacy, quantitatively identifies various improvements for drug design and emphasizes the need for QSP modelling to support the development of tau and aSyn antibodies.",2023,,"Humans; Network Pharmacology; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Biological Transport; Diffusion; Parkinson Disease","Geerts, H; Bergeler, S; Walker, M; van der Graaf, PH; Courade, JP"

Involvement of ApoE4 in dementia with Lewy bodies in the prodromal and demented stages: evaluation of the Strasbourg cohort.,"ApoE4 as a risk factor for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is still an issue. We sought to determine the involvement of ApoE4 according to different clinical parameters in our cohort of patients from Strasbourg, France. ApoE genotyping was performed on the AlphaLewyMA cohort. In this cohort, 197 patients were genotyped: 105 DLB patients, 37 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 29 patients with AD/DLB comorbidity, and 26 control subjects (CS). The groups of patients were also classified according to the stage of evolution of the disease: prodromal or demented. We analyzed other parameters in relation to ApoE4 status, such as years of education (YOE) and Alzheimer CSF biomarkers. We observed a higher proportion of ApoE4 carriers in the AD (51.4%) and AD/DLB (72.4%) groups compared to the DLB (25.7%) and CS (11.5%) groups (p < 0.0001). We found a correlation between age at disease onset and YOE in the AD group (p = 0.039) but not in the DLB group (p = 0.056). Interestingly, in the DLB group, the subgroup of patients with high YOE (≥ 11) had significantly more patients with ApoE4 than the subgroup with low YOE (< 11). AD biomarkers did not seem to be impacted by the presence of ApoE4, except for Aβ42: DLB ApoE4-positive demented patients showed a more marked Aβ42 decrease. ApoE4 does not appear to be a risk factor for ""pure"" DLB patients. These results suggest a strong link between ApoE4 and amyloidopathy and consequently with AD.

A two-step workflow based on plasma p-tau217 to screen for amyloid β positivity with further confirmatory testing only in uncertain cases.,"Cost-effective strategies for identifying amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity in patients with cognitive impairment are urgently needed with recent approvals of anti-Aβ immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood biomarkers can accurately detect AD pathology, but it is unclear whether their incorporation into a full diagnostic workflow can reduce the number of confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) tests needed while accurately classifying patients. We evaluated a two-step workflow for determining Aβ-PET status in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from two independent memory clinic-based cohorts (n = 348). A blood-based model including plasma tau protein 217 (p-tau217), age and APOE ε4 status was developed in BioFINDER-1 (area under the curve (AUC) = 89.3%) and validated in BioFINDER-2 (AUC = 94.3%). In step 1, the blood-based model was used to stratify the patients into low, intermediate or high risk of Aβ-PET positivity. In step 2, we assumed referral only of intermediate-risk patients to CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 testing, whereas step 1 alone determined Aβ-status for low- and high-risk groups. Depending on whether lenient, moderate or stringent thresholds were used in step 1, the two-step workflow overall accuracy for detecting Aβ-PET status was 88.2%, 90.5% and 92.0%, respectively, while reducing the number of necessary CSF tests by 85.9%, 72.7% and 61.2%, respectively. In secondary analyses, an adapted version of the BioFINDER-1 model led to successful validation of the two-step workflow with a different plasma p-tau217 immunoassay in patients with cognitive impairment from the TRIAD cohort (n = 84). In conclusion, using a plasma p-tau217-based model for risk stratification of patients with MCI can substantially reduce the need for confirmatory testing while accurately classifying patients, offering a cost-effective strategy to detect AD in memory clinic settings.",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Workflow; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Blood Proteins; Alzheimer Disease","Brum, WS; Cullen, NC; Janelidze, S; Ashton, NJ; Zimmer, ER; Therriault, J; Benedet, AL; Rahmouni, N; Tissot, C; Stevenson, J; Servaes, S; Triana-Baltzer, G; Kolb, HC; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Rosa-Neto, P; Blennow, K; Hansson, O"

First Observations of a Potential Association Between Accumulation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in the Central Nervous System and Markers of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The entire human population is exposed to persistent organic pollutants throughout their lives. Among them, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals widely used in industrial and consumer products that are known to exert adverse effects on human health. As they bioaccumulate in the human brain and are known to be neurotoxic in experimental models, they are assumed to be involved in neurodegenerative processes. In this proof-of-concept study, we measured the level of 18 PFAS in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 8 patients hospitalized with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus. We then analyzed whether PFAS levels could be related to both biological and clinical markers of Alzheimer's disease. We showed that PFAS and perfluorooctanesulfonate were found in all CSF samples from a French region without fluorochemical industries. Moreover, we observed a significant difference between the levels of PFAS and perfluorooctanesulfonate in the CSF of patients with both Alzheimer's disease markers and cognitive impairment compared with those with only 1 or neither. Two previous studies have shown that PFAS levels in human CSF increase with age and are linked to impaired blood-brain barrier integrity.

A state-of-the-art review on miRNA in prevention and treatment of Alzheimer,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and heterogenic disorder. MiRNA is a class of non-coding RNAs with 19-22 nucleotides in length that can regulate the expression of target genes in the post-transcriptional level. It has been found that the miRNAome in AD patients is significantly altered in brain tissues, cerebrospinal fluid and blood circulation, as compared to healthy subjects. Experimental studies have suggested that expression changes in miRNA could drive AD onset and development via different mechanisms. Therefore, targeting miRNA expression to regulate the key genes involved in AD progression is anticipated to be a promising approach for AD prevention and treatment. Rodent AD models have demonstrated that targeting miRNAs could block biogenesis and toxicity of amyloid β, inhibit the production and hyper-phosphorylation of τ protein, prevent neuronal apoptosis and promote neurogenesis, maintain neural synaptic and calcium homeostasis, as well as mitigate neuroinflammation mediated by microglia. In addition, animal and human studies support the view that miRNAs are critical players contributing to the beneficial effects of cell therapy and lifestyle intervention to AD. This article reviews the most recent advances in the roles, mechanisms and applications of targeting miRNA in AD prevention and treatment based on rodent AD models and human intervention studies. The potential opportunities and challenges in clinical application of targeting miRNA for AD patients are also discussed.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid β; MicroRNA; Neurogenesis; Neuroinflam-mation; Review; Synaptic homeostasis; τ protein,Animals; Humans; MicroRNAs; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apoptosis; Microglia,"Guo, X"

Epitope mapping of nanobodies binding the Alzheimer's disease receptor SORLA.,"Reduced levels of the Sortilin-related receptor with A-type repeats (SORLA) in different brain regions as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid have been associated with Alzheimer's disease. Methods and reagents to develop reliable detection assays to quantify SORLA and its specific isoforms are therefore much needed. Nanobodies (Nbs) are unique biomolecules derived from the blood of camelids that display advantageous physicochemical and antigen affinity properties, making them attractive tools with great relevance to both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here, we purified and characterized eight Nbs that were isolated from the blood of an alpaca immunized with the recombinant extracellular domain of SORLA. The selected Nbs showed high affinity to SORLA in the low nanomolar range as observed by surface plasmon resonance. For mapping of the Nbs' epitopes within the antigen, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with a panel of SORLA deletion constructs, and developed a protocol of immunostaining by applying fluorescent dye conjugated Nbs. With this method, we showed that the selected Nbs specifically recognize a part of SORLA containing Fibronectin-type III domains, representing promising tools not only for disease clarifying research, but also for translational medicine as candidates for clinical diagnostic purposes.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Epitope mapping; Nanobodies; SORLA,Humans; Single-Domain Antibodies; Epitope Mapping; Alzheimer Disease; HEK293 Cells; Epitopes,"Monti, G; Vincke, C; Lunding, M; Jensen, AMG; Madsen, P; Muyldermans, S; Kjolby, M; Andersen, OM"
The Association of Selected GWAS Reported AD Risk Loci with CSF Biomarker Levels and Cognitive Decline in Slovenian Patients.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, with a complex genetic background. Apart from rare, familial cases, a combination of multiple risk loci contributes to the susceptibility of the disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous AD risk loci. Changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and imaging techniques can detect AD-related brain changes before the onset of clinical symptoms, even in the presence of preclinical mild cognitive impairment. In this study, we aimed to assess the associations between SNPs in well-established GWAS AD risk loci and CSF biomarker levels or cognitive test results in Slovenian patients with cognitive decline.

The Deficits of Insulin Signal in Alzheimer's Disease and the Mechanisms of Vanadium Compounds in Curing AD.,"Vanadium is a well-known essential trace element, which usually exists in oxidation states in the form of a vanadate cation intracellularly. The pharmacological study of vanadium began with the discovery of its unexpected inhibitory effect on ATPase. Thereafter, its protective effects on β cells and its ability in glucose metabolism regulation were observed from the vanadium compound, leading to the application of vanadium compounds in clinical trials for curing diabetes. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia disease in elderly people. However, there are still no efficient agents for treating AD safely to date. This is mainly because of the complexity of the pathology, which is characterized by senile plaques composed of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein in the parenchyma of the brain and the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are derived from the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the neurocyte, along with mitochondrial damage, and eventually the central nervous system (CNS) atrophy. AD was also illustrated as type-3 diabetes because of the observations of insulin deficiency and the high level of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as the impaired insulin signaling in the brain. In this review, we summarize the advances in applicating the vanadium compound to AD treatment in experimental research and point out the limitations of the current study using vanadium compounds in AD treatment.

Integration of plasma and CSF metabolomics with CSF proteomic reveals novel associations between lipid mediators and central nervous system vascular and energy metabolism.,"Integration of the omics data, including metabolomics and proteomics, provides a unique opportunity to search for new associations within metabolic disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Using metabolomics, we have previously profiled oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids, and steroids in 293 CSF and 202 matched plasma samples from AD cases and healthy controls and identified both central and peripheral markers of AD pathology within inflammation-regulating cytochrome p450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway. Additionally, using proteomics, we have identified five cerebrospinal fluid protein panels, involved in the regulation of energy metabolism, vasculature, myelin/oligodendrocyte, glia/inflammation, and synapses/neurons, affected in AD, and reflective of AD-related changes in the brain. In the current manuscript, using metabolomics-proteomics data integration, we describe new associations between peripheral and central lipid mediators, with the above-described CSF protein panels. Particularly strong associations were observed between cytochrome p450/soluble epoxide hydrolase metabolites, bile acids, and proteins involved in glycolysis, blood coagulation, and vascular inflammation and the regulators of extracellular matrix. Those metabolic associations were not observed at the gene-co-expression level in the central nervous system. In summary, this manuscript provides new information regarding Alzheimer's disease, linking both central and peripheral metabolism, and illustrates the necessity for the ""omics"" data integration to uncover associations beyond gene co-expression.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Epoxide Hydrolases; Proteomics; Central Nervous System; Energy Metabolism; Metabolomics; Bile Acids and Salts; Endocannabinoids,"Borkowski, K; Seyfried, NT; Arnold, M; Lah, JJ; Levey, AI; Hales, CM; Dammer, EB; Blach, C; Louie, G; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Newman, JW"
Glucose metabolism in posterior cingulate cortex has supplementary value to predict the progression of cognitively unimpaired to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease: an exploratory study of ,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau are important biomarkers to predict the progression of cognitively unimpaired (CU) to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), according to the diagnosis framework from the US National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA). However, it is clinically difficult to predict those subjects who were already with Aβ positive (A +) or tau positive (T +). As a typical characteristic of neurodegeneration in the diagnosis framework, the hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) has significant clinical value in the early prediction and prevention of AD. In this paper, we proposed the glucose metabolism in the PCC as a biomarker supplement to Aβ and tau biomarkers. First, we calculated the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of PCC based on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (FDG PET) imaging. Secondly, we performed Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses to explore the predictive performance of PCC SUVR, and the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated. Finally, we performed Pearson correlation analyses to explore the physiological significance of PCC SUVR. As a result, the PCC SUVR showed a consistent downward trend along the AD continuum. KM analyses showed better predictive performance when we combined PCC SUVR with cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) Aβ",2024,Cognitively unimpaired; FDG PET; Kaplan–Meier analysis; Neurodegeneration; Posterior cingulate cortex,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Gyrus Cinguli; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Glucose,"Zhang, Q; Fan, C; Wang, L; Li, T; Wang, M; Han, Y; Jiang, J"

Oral treatment with the all-d-peptide RD2 enhances cognition in aged beagle dogs - A model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.,"Disease-modifying therapies to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) are of fundamental interest for aging humans, societies, and health care systems. Predictable disease progression in transgenic AD models favors preclinical studies employing a preventive study design with an early pre-symptomatic treatment start, instead of assessing a truly curative approach with treatment starting after diagnosed disease onset. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of RD2 to enhance short-term memory and cognition in cognitively impaired aged Beagle dogs - a non-transgenic model of truly sporadic AD. RD2 has previously demonstrated pharmacodynamic efficacy in three different transgenic AD mouse models in three different laboratories.

"Towards the Integrative Theory of Alzheimer's Disease: Linking Molecular Mechanisms of Neurotoxicity, Beta-amyloid Biomarkers, and the Diagnosis.","A major gap in amyloid-centric theories of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is that even though amyloid fibrils per se are not toxic in vitro, the diagnosis of AD clearly correlates with the density of beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposits. Based on our proposed amyloid degradation toxicity hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model explaining this discrepancy. It suggests that cytotoxicity depends on the cellular uptake of soluble Aβ rather than on the presence of amyloid aggregates. The dynamics of soluble beta-amyloid in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the density of Aβ deposits is described using a system of differential equations. In the model, cytotoxic damage is proportional to the cellular uptake of Aβ, while the probability of an AD diagnosis is defined by the Aβ cytotoxicity accumulated over the duration of the disease. After uptake, Aβ is concentrated intralysosomally, promoting the formation of fibrillation seeds inside cells. These seeds cannot be digested and are either accumulated intracellularly or exocytosed. Aβ starts aggregating on the extracellular seeds and, therefore, decreases in concentration in the interstitial fluid. The dependence of both Aβ toxicity and aggregation on the same process-cellular uptake of Aβ-explains the correlation between AD diagnosis and the density of amyloid aggregates in the brain.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid depositions; beta-amyloid toxicity; cellular uptake; lysosome.,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Brain; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Molkov, YI; Zaretskaia, MV; Zaretsky, DV"
"Biosensors, Recent Advances in Determination of BDNF and NfL.","Key biomarkers such as Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Neurofilament light chain (NfL) play important roles in the development and progression of many neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

In this context, robust biomarker discovery is of critical importance for screening, early detection, and monitoring of neurological diseases. The difficulty of directly identifying biochemical processes in the central nervous system (CNS) is challenging. In recent years, biomarkers of CNS inflammatory response have been identified in various body fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tears. Furthermore, biotechnology and nanotechnology have facilitated the development of biosensor platforms capable of real-time detection of multiple biomarkers in clinically relevant samples. Biosensing technology is approaching maturity and will be deployed in communities, at which point screening programs and personalized medicine will become a reality.

"Amyloid-β slows cilia movement along the ventricle, impairs fluid flow, and exacerbates its neurotoxicity in explant culture.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extensive and selective death of neurons and deterioration of synapses and circuits in the brain. The Aβ1-42 concentration is higher in an AD brain than in cognitively normal elderly individuals, and Aβ1-42 exhibits neurotoxicity. Brain-derived Aβ is transported into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and CSF flow is driven in part by the beating of cilia and CSF secretion into ventricles. Ventricles are lined with ependyma whose apical surface is covered with motile cilia. Herein, we constructed an experimental system to measure the movement of ependymal cilia and examined the effects of Aβ1-42 to the beating of cilia and neurons. The circadian rhythm of the beating frequency of ependymal cilia was detected using brain wall explant-cultures containing ependymal cilia and neurons; the beating frequency was high at midday and low at midnight. Aβ1-42 decreased the peak frequency of ciliary beating at midday and slightly increased it at midnight. Aβ1-42 exhibited neurotoxicity to neurons on the non-ciliated side of the explant culture, while the neurotoxicity was less evident in neurons on the ciliated side. The neurotoxic effect of Aβ1-42 was diminished when 1 mPa of shear stress was generated using a flow chamber system that mimicked the flow by cilia. These results indicate that Aβ1-42 affects the circadian rhythm of ciliary beating, decreases the medium flow by the cilia-beating, and enhances the neurotoxic action of Aβ1-42 in the brain explant culture.",2023,,Aged; Humans; Cilia; Cerebral Ventricles; Brain; Ependyma; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Neurotoxicity Syndromes,"Makibatake, R; Oda, S; Yagi, Y; Tatsumi, H"

The role of signaling crosstalk of microglia in hippocampus on progression of ageing and Alzheimer's disease.,"Based on single-cell sequencing of the hippocampi of 5× familiar Alzheimer's disease (5× FAD) and wild type mice at 2-, 12-, and 24-month of age, we found an increased percentage of microglia in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. Blood brain barrier injury may also have contributed to this increase. Immune regulation by microglia plays a major role in the progression of aging and AD, according to the functions of 41 intersecting differentially expressed genes in microglia. Signaling crosstalk between C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) and major histocompatibility complex-1 bridges intercellular communication in the hippocampus during aging and AD. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and colony stimulating factor (CSF) signals drive 5× FAD to deviate from aging track to AD occurrence among intercellular communication in hippocampus. Microglia are involved in the progression of aging and AD can be divided into 10 functional types. The strength of the interaction among microglial subtypes weakened with aging, and the CCL and CSF signaling pathways were the fundamental bridge of communication among microglial subtypes.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Chemokine; Colony-stimulating factor; Crosstalk; Immune; Microglia,,"Li, H; Ye, T; Liu, X; Guo, R; Yang, X; Li, Y; Qi, D; Wei, Y; Zhu, Y; Wen, L; Cheng, X"

Clinical and neurochemical correlates of the APOE genotype in early-stage Parkinson's disease.,"Emerging evidence indicates that apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype may influence Parkinson's disease (PD) course, although clinical and neurochemical correlates have not been completely established. This study aimed to determine the associations of APOE genotypes (ε4 vs. non-ε4) with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurodegeneration biomarkers and clinical parameters in early-stage PD patients. One hundred and seventy-five PD patients and 89 non-neurodegenerative controls grouped in APOE-ε4 carriers (28 PD; 12 controls) and non-APOE-ε4 carriers (147 PD; 78 controls) were enrolled. CSF levels of amyloid-β-42, amyloid-β-40, total and 181-phosphorylated tau, and clinical scores were compared among groups adjusting for main covariates. APOE genotypes prevalence was similar in PD and controls. PD APOE-ε4 carriers had lower amyloid-β-42 CSF levels than PD non-APOE-ε4 carriers and controls, independently from age. PD APOE-ε4 carriers also had higher total and ""item 5"" (attention and memory) non-motor symptoms scale scores than PD non-APOE-ε4 carriers, independently from confounding factors. APOE-ε4 genotype might thus account for a more vulnerable PD subtype characterized by prominent amyloidopathy and a greater burden of non-motor symptoms in the early disease stages.

Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction and Aβ42/40 Ratio Dose-Dependent Modulation with the ApoE Genotype within the ATN Framework.,"The definition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) now considers the presence of the markers of amyloid (A), tau deposition (T), and neurodegeneration (N) essential for diagnosis. AD patients have been reported to have increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, but that has not been tested within the ATN framework so far. As the field is moving towards the use of blood-based biomarkers, the relationship between BBB disruption and AD-specific biomarkers requires considerable attention. Moreover, other factors have been previously implicated in modulating BBB permeability, including age, gender, and ApoE status. A total of 172 cognitively impaired individuals underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for AD biomarkers, and data on BBB dysfunction, demographics, and ApoE status were collected. Our data showed that there was no difference in BBB dysfunction across different ATN subtypes, and that BBB damage was not correlated with cognitive impairment. However, patients with BBB disruption, if measured with a high Qalb, had low Aβ40 levels. ApoE status did not affect BBB function but had a dose-dependent effect on the Aβ42/40 ratio. These results might highlight the importance of understanding dynamic changes across the BBB in future studies in patients with AD.",2023,ATN; Alzheimer’s disease; ApoE; Aβ amyloid; blood–brain barrier,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoproteins E; Biomarkers; Blood-Brain Barrier; Cognitive Dysfunction; Genotype; Peptide Fragments; tau Proteins,"Toniolo, S; Di Lorenzo, F; Bernardini, S; Mercuri, NB; Sancesario, GM"
Emerging Roles of Cells and Molecules of Innate Immunity in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The inflammatory response that marks Alzheimer's disease (neuroinflammation) is considered a double-edged sword. Microglia have been shown to play a protective role at the beginning of the disease. Still, persistent harmful stimuli further activate microglia, inducing an exacerbating inflammatory process which impairs β-amyloid peptide clearance capability and leads to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Moreover, microglia also appear to be closely involved in the spread of tau pathology. Soluble TREM2 also represents a crucial player in the neuroinflammatory processes. Elevated levels of TREM2 in cerebrospinal fluid have been associated with increased amyloid plaque burden, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the intricate relationship between innate immunity and Alzheimer's disease will be a promising strategy for future advancements in diagnosis and new therapeutic interventions targeting innate immunity, by modulating its activity. Still, additional and more robust studies are needed to translate these findings into effective treatments. In this review, we focus on the role of cells (microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) and molecules (TREM2, tau, and β-amyloid) of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and their possible exploitation as disease biomarkers and targets of therapeutical approaches.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; microglia; neuroinflammation,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Immunity, Innate; Microglia; Cognitive Dysfunction","Tamburini, B; Badami, GD; La Manna, MP; Shekarkar Azgomi, M; Caccamo, N; Dieli, F"

Methods to Discover and Validate Biofluid-Based Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Dementias.,"Neurodegenerative dementias are progressive diseases that cause neuronal network breakdown in different brain regions often because of accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain extracellular matrix, such as amyloids or inside neurons or other cell types of the brain. Several diagnostic protein biomarkers in body fluids are being used and implemented, such as for Alzheimer's disease. However, there is still a lack of biomarkers for co-pathologies and other causes of dementia. Such biofluid-based biomarkers enable precision medicine approaches for diagnosis and treatment, allow to learn more about underlying disease processes, and facilitate the development of patient inclusion and evaluation tools in clinical trials. When designing studies to discover novel biofluid-based biomarkers, choice of technology is an important starting point. But there are so many technologies to choose among. To address this, we here review the technologies that are currently available in research settings and, in some cases, in clinical laboratory practice.

We here compare the 4MT to the CERAD word list memory recall in both cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases with or without cerebrospinal fluid markers (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Linear regression was used to assess the influence of CSF determined Aβ-plaque (Aβ-/+) or neurofibrillary tau tangles (Tau-/+) on 4MT and CERAD recall performance. Analyses were performed in the full sample and the CN and MCI sub-samples. Pearson correlations were calculated to examine the relationship between 4MT and tests of psychomotor speed, verbal memory, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, and visuo-spatial perception. Analyses showed no significant differences in 4MT scores between Aβ-/Aβ+, nor Tau-/Tau + participants, irrespective of cognitive status.

Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics define the natural history of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology develops many years before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Two pathological processes-aggregation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide into plaques and the microtubule protein tau into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)-are hallmarks of the disease. However, other pathological brain processes are thought to be key disease mediators of Aβ plaque and NFT pathology. How these additional pathologies evolve over the course of the disease is currently unknown. Here we show that proteomic measurements in autosomal dominant AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) linked to brain protein coexpression can be used to characterize the evolution of AD pathology over a timescale spanning six decades. SMOC1 and SPON1 proteins associated with Aβ plaques were elevated in AD CSF nearly 30 years before the onset of symptoms, followed by changes in synaptic proteins, metabolic proteins, axonal proteins, inflammatory proteins and finally decreases in neurosecretory proteins. The proteome discriminated mutation carriers from noncarriers before symptom onset as well or better than Aβ and tau measures. Our results highlight the multifaceted landscape of AD pathophysiology and its temporal evolution.

[How Helpful are Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for the Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease?].,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies on imaging and fluid biomarkers to objectively detect and quantitatively evaluate brain AD pathologies. Amyloid- and tau-PET scans recently enabled clinicians to make definitive diagnoses based on abnormal amyloid/tau deposition in the human brain. Since PET scans and blood-based biomarkers are mutually complementary, the identification of suitable blood-based biomarkers is essential for screening brain AD pathologies. According to the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) Research Framework published in 2018, AD is defined by its underlying pathologic processes, which can be diagnosed in vivo using suitable biomarkers. These biomarkers are categorized under the ATN classification system, including β amyloid deposition (A), pathologic tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N). Originally, all the ATN fluid biomarkers were assessed using cerebrospinal fluid, but currently these biomarkers can be quantified using blood samples. Among those blood-based ATN biomarkers, the plasma levels of Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) representing ""A,"" ""T,"" and ""N"" biomarkers, respectively, are useful in the early diagnosis of AD.

How should we be using biomarkers in trials of disease modification in Parkinson's disease?,"The recent validation of the α-synuclein seed amplification assay as a biomarker with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease has formed the backbone for a proposed staging system for incorporation in Parkinson's disease clinical studies and trials. The routine use of this biomarker should greatly aid in the accuracy of diagnosis during recruitment of Parkinson's disease patients into trials (as distinct from patients with non-Parkinson's disease parkinsonism or non-Parkinson's disease tremors). There remain, however, further challenges in the pursuit of biomarkers for clinical trials of disease modifying agents in Parkinson's disease, namely: optimizing the distinction between different α-synucleinopathies; the selection of subgroups most likely to benefit from a candidate disease modifying agent; a sensitive means of confirming target engagement; and the early prediction of longer-term clinical benefit. For example, levels of CSF proteins such as the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase may assist in prognostication or allow enrichment of appropriate patients into disease modifying trials of agents with this enzyme as the target; the presence of coexisting Alzheimer's disease-like pathology (detectable through CSF levels of amyloid-β42 and tau) can predict subsequent cognitive decline; imaging techniques such as free-water or neuromelanin MRI may objectively track decline in Parkinson's disease even in its later stages. The exploitation of additional biomarkers to the α-synuclein seed amplification assay will, therefore, greatly add to our ability to plan trials and assess the disease modifying properties of interventions. The choice of which biomarker(s) to use in the context of disease modifying clinical trials will depend on the intervention, the stage (at risk, premotor, motor, complex) of the population recruited and the aims of the trial. The progress already made lends hope that panels of fluid biomarkers in tandem with structural or functional imaging may provide sensitive and objective methods of confirming that an intervention is modifying a key pathophysiological process of Parkinson's disease. However, correlation with clinical progression does not necessarily equate to causation, and the ongoing validation of quantitative biomarkers will depend on insightful clinical-genetic-pathophysiological comparisons incorporating longitudinal biomarker changes from those at genetic risk with evidence of onset of the pathophysiology and those at each stage of manifest clinical Parkinson's disease.",2023,Parkinson’s disease; biomarkers; clinical trials; disease modification,Humans; Parkinson Disease; alpha-Synuclein; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Longitudinal Studies,"Vijiaratnam, N; Foltynie, T"

Cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory biomarkers for disease progression in Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis: a systematic review.,"Inflammatory processes are involved in the pathophysiology of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) but their exact contribution to disease progression remains to be deciphered. Biomarkers are needed to define pathophysiological processes of these disorders, who may increasingly co-exist in the elderly generations of the future, due to the rising prevalence in both and ameliorated treatment options with improved life expectancy in MS. The purpose of this review was to provide a systematic overview of inflammatory biomarkers, as measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), that are associated with clinical disease progression. International peer-reviewed literature was screened using the PubMed and Web of Science databases. Disease progression had to be measured using clinically validated tests representing baseline functional and/or cognitive status, the evolution of such clinical scores over time and/or the transitioning from one disease stage to a more severe stage. The quality of included studies was systematically evaluated using a set of questions for clinical, neurochemical and statistical characteristics of the study. A total of 84 papers were included (twenty-five for AD and 59 for MS). Elevated CSF levels of chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) were associated with disease progression in both AD and MS. Osteopontin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were more specifically related to disease progression in AD, whereas the same was true for interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-X-C motif ligand 13, glial fibrillary acidic protein and IgG oligoclonal bands in MS. We observed a broad heterogeneity of studies with varying cohort characterization, non-disclosure of quality measures for neurochemical analyses and a lack of adequate longitudinal designs. Most of the retrieved biomarkers are related to innate immune system activity, which seems to be an important mediator of clinical disease progression in AD and MS.

Potential Utility of Cerebrospinal Fluid Glycoprotein Nonmetastatic Melanoma Protein B as a Neuroinflammatory Diagnostic Biomarker in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual loss of neurons and extracellular amyloid-peptide buildup. There is compelling evidence that the disease process depends on neuroinflammatory alterations, such as the activation of astrocytes and microglia cells. A transmembrane glycoprotein known as glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) plays a neuroprotective role during the development of neurodegeneration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation discussing the potential clinical usefulness of this protein in the AD continuum, especially in the MCI (mild cognitive impairment) stage. A total of 71 patients with AD or MCI as well as controls were enrolled in this study. The concentrations of GPNMB, YKL-40, Aβ1-42 (amyloid beta 1-42), Tau, and pTau and the Aβ1-42/1-40 ratio in the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) were tested using immunological methods. The concentrations of both GPNMB and YKL-40 in the cerebrospinal fluid were significantly higher in patients with AD and MCI compared to the controls. Moreover, both proteins were biochemically associated with classical biomarkers of AD and were especially associated with the Aβ1-42/1-40 ratio and Tau and pTau levels in the whole study group. Elevated concentrations of GPNMB were observed in the Aβ(+) group of AD patients compared to the Aβ(-) subjects. Additionally, the diagnostic performance (AUC value) of GPNMB was higher than that of amyloid β1-42 in MCI patients compared with controls. Our study indicates that GPNMB might be a promising neuroinflammatory biomarker for the early diagnosis and prognosis of the AD continuum, with potential utility as a therapeutic target.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; GPNMB; YKL-40; neuroinflammation,,"Doroszkiewicz, J; Kulczyńska-Przybik, A; Dulewicz, M; Borawska, R; Zajkowska, M; Słowik, A; Mroczko, B"
Genome-Wide Epistasis Study of Cerebrospinal Fluid Hyperphosphorylated Tau in ADNI Cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide, and the genetic mechanism of which is not yet fully understood. Much evidence has accumulated over the past decade to suggest that after the first large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted, the problem of ""missing heritability"" in AD is still a great challenge. Epistasis has been considered as one of the main causes of ""missing heritability"" in AD, which has been largely ignored in human genetics. The focus of current genome-wide epistasis studies is usually on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have significant individual effects, and the amount of heritability explained by which was very low. Moreover, AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal damage, and some studies have suggested that hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) mediates neuronal death by inducing necroptosis and inflammation in AD. Therefore, this study focused on identifying epistasis between two-marker interactions at marginal main effects across the whole genome using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) P-tau as quantitative trait (QT). We sought to detect interactions between SNPs in a multi-GPU based linear regression method by using age, gender, and clinical diagnostic status (cds) as covariates. We then used the STRING online tool to perform the PPI network and identify two-marker epistasis at the level of gene-gene interaction. A total of 758 SNP pairs were found to be statistically significant. Particularly, between the marginal main effect SNP pairs, highly significant SNP-SNP interactions were identified, which explained a relatively high variance at the P-tau level. In addition, 331 AD-related genes were identified, 10 gene-gene interaction pairs were replicated in the PPI network. The identified gene-gene interactions and genes showed associations with AD in terms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, neuronal cells activation and brain development, thereby leading to cognitive decline in AD, which is indirectly associated with the P-tau pathological feature of AD and in turn supports the results of this study. Thus, the results of our study might be beneficial for explaining part of the ""missing heritability"" of AD.",2023,ADNI; Alzheimer’s disease; PPI; epistasis; hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau),"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Genome-Wide Association Study; Epistasis, Genetic","Chen, D; Li, J; Liu, H; Liu, X; Zhang, C; Luo, H; Wei, Y; Xi, Y; Liang, H; Zhang, Q"

The Brain's Glymphatic System: Drawing New Perspectives in Neuroscience.,"This paper delves into the intricate structure and functionality of the brain's glymphatic system, bringing forth new dimensions in its neuroscientific understanding. This paper commences by exploring the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-its localization, production, and pivotal role within the central nervous system, acting as a cushion and vehicle for nutrient distribution and waste elimination. We then transition into an in-depth study of the morphophysiological aspects of the glymphatic system, a recent discovery revolutionizing the perception of waste clearance from the brain, highlighting its lymphatic-like characteristics and remarkable operations. This paper subsequently emphasizes the glymphatic system's potential implications in Alzheimer's disease (AD), discussing the connection between inefficient glymphatic clearance and AD pathogenesis. This review also elucidates the intriguing interplay between the glymphatic system and the circadian rhythm, illustrating the optimal functioning of glymphatic clearance during sleep. Lastly, we underscore the hitherto underappreciated involvement of the glymphatic system in the tumoral microenvironment, potentially impacting tumor growth and progression.

Liquid Biopsy in Neurological Diseases.,"The most recent and non-invasive approach for studying early-stage biomarkers is liquid biopsy. This implies the extraction and analysis of non-solid biological tissues (serum, plasma, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid) without undergoing invasive procedures to determine disease prognosis. Liquid biopsy can be used for the screening of several components, such as extracellular vesicles, microRNAs, cell-free DNA, cell-free mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, transfer RNA, and circular DNA or RNA derived from body fluids. Its application includes early disease diagnosis, the surveillance of disease activity, and treatment response monitoring, with growing evidence for validating this methodology in cancer, liver disease, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This review will provide an overview of mentioned liquid biopsy components, which could serve as valuable biomarkers for the evaluation of complex neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, CNS tumours, and neuroinfectious diseases.

"Electrochemical Immunosensors Developed for Amyloid-Beta and Tau Proteins, Leading Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurological disease and a serious cause of dementia, which constitutes a threat to human health. The clinical evidence has found that extracellular amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and intracellular tau proteins, which are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), are the leading biomarkers for accurate and early diagnosis of AD due to their central role in disease pathology, their correlation with disease progression, their diagnostic value, and their implications for therapeutic interventions. Their detection and monitoring contribute significantly to understanding AD and advancing clinical care. Available diagnostic techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), are mainly used to validate AD diagnosis. However, these methods are expensive, yield results that are difficult to interpret, and have common side effects such as headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, researchers have focused on developing cost-effective, portable, and point-of-care alternative diagnostic devices to detect specific biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other biofluids.

Novel CSF tau biomarkers can be used for disease staging of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.,"Biological staging of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may improve diagnostic and prognostic work-up of dementia in clinical practice and the design of clinical trials. Here, we created a staging model using the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm by evaluating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau biomarkers in 426 participants from BioFINDER-2, that represent the entire spectrum of AD. The model composition and main analyses were replicated in 222 participants from the Knight ADRC cohort. SuStaIn revealed in the two cohorts that the data was best explained by a single biomarker sequence (one subtype), and that five CSF biomarkers (ordered: Aβ42/40, tau phosphorylation occupancies at the residues 217 and 205 [pT217/T217 and pT205/T205], microtubule-binding region of tau containing the residue 243 [MTBR-tau243], and total tau) were sufficient to create an accurate disease staging model. Increasing CSF stages (0-5) were associated with increased abnormality in other AD-related biomarkers, such as Aβ- and tau-PET, and aligned with different phases of longitudinal biomarker changes consistent with current models of AD progression. Higher CSF stages at baseline were associated with higher hazard ratio of clinical decline.

The performance of plasma phosphorylated tau231 in detecting Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau231 (P-tau231) is associated with neuropathological outcomes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The invasive access of cerebrospinal fluid has greatly stimulated interest in the identification of blood-based P-tau231, and the recent advent of single-molecule array assay for the quantification of plasma P-tau231 may provide a turning point to evaluate the usefulness of P-tau231 as an AD-related biomarker. Yet, in the plasma P-tau231 literature, findings with regard to its diagnostic utility have been inconsistent, and thus, we aimed to statistically investigate the potential of plasma P-tau231 in the context of AD via meta-analysis. Publications on plasma P-tau231 were systematically retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and Web of Science databases. A total of 10 studies covering 2007 participants were included, and we conducted random-effect or fixed-effect meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis using the STATA SE 14.0 software. According to our quantitative integration, plasma P-tau231 increased from cognitively unimpaired (CU) populations to mild cognitive impairment to AD and showed significant changes in pairwise comparisons of AD, mild cognitive impairment and CU.

"Individual regional associations between Aβ-, tau- and neurodegeneration (ATN) with microglial activation in patients with primary and secondary tauopathies.","β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau aggregation as well as neuronal injury and atrophy (ATN) are the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and biomarkers for these hallmarks have been linked to neuroinflammation. However, the detailed regional associations of these biomarkers with microglial activation in individual patients remain to be elucidated. We investigated a cohort of 55 patients with AD and primary tauopathies and 10 healthy controls that underwent TSPO-, Aβ-, tau-, and perfusion-surrogate-PET, as well as structural MRI. Z-score deviations for 246 brain regions were calculated and biomarker contributions of Aβ (A), tau (T), perfusion (N1), and gray matter atrophy (N2) to microglial activation (TSPO, I) were calculated for each individual subject. Individual ATN-related microglial activation was correlated with clinical performance and CSF soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) concentrations. In typical and atypical AD, regional tau was stronger and more frequently associated with microglial activation when compared to regional Aβ (AD: β",2023,,"Humans; Microglia; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Tauopathies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Atrophy; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Receptors, GABA","Finze, A; Biechele, G; Rauchmann, BS; Franzmeier, N; Palleis, C; Katzdobler, S; Weidinger, E; Guersel, S; Schuster, S; Harris, S; Schmitt, J; Beyer, L; Gnörich, J; Lindner, S; Albert, NL; Wetzel, CH; Rupprecht, R; Rominger, A; Danek, A; Burow, L; Kurz, C; Tato, M; Utecht, J; Papazov, B; Zaganjori, M; Trappmann, LK; Goldhardt, O; Grimmer, T; Haeckert, J; Janowitz, D; Buerger, K; Keeser, D; Stoecklein, S; Dietrich, O; Morenas-Rodriguez, E; Barthel, H; Sabri, O; Bartenstein, P; Simons, M; Haass, C; Höglinger, GU; Levin, J; Perneczky, R; Brendel, M"

Aquaporin-4 Mediated Aggregation of Alzheimer's Amyloid β-Peptide.,"Clearance of Alzheimer's amyloid oligomers from the brain is crucial for preventing cell toxicity. Dementia complications arise as a result of apoptosis, which is caused by peptide plaques on the lipid surface of cells. Here, we employed all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the aggregation of amyloid peptides at the lipid surface and the role of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in facilitating peptide clearance from astrocytes. The network of protein-protein interactions through text mining revealed that the expression of AQP4 and amyloid aggregation were strongly correlated. It has also been revealed that the role of aquaporins in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease involves several interconnected proteins and pathways.

Glymphatic system: an emerging therapeutic approach for neurological disorders.,"The functions of the glymphatic system include clearance of the metabolic waste and modulation of the water transport in the brain, and it forms a brain-wide fluid network along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF). The glymphatic pathway consists of periarterial influx of CSF, astrocyte-mediated interchange between ISF and CSF supported by aquaporin-4 (AQP4) on the endfeet of astrocyte around the periarterioles, and perivenous efflux of CSF. Finally, CSF is absorbed by the arachnoid granules or flows into the cervical lymphatic vessels. There is growing evidence from animal experiments that the glymphatic system dysfunction is involved in many neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury and meningitis. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the glymphatic system and its driving factors, as well as changes in the glymphatic pathway in different neurological diseases. We significantly highlight the likely therapeutic approaches for glymphatic pathway in neurological diseases, and the importance of AQP4 and normal sleep architecture in this process.",2023,AQP4; glymphatic system; neurological disorders; sleep architecture; therapeutic approaches,,"Gao, Y; Liu, K; Zhu, J"

Cerebrospinal fluid microRNAs as potential biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia worldwide, but its early detection and diagnosis remain a challenge. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small endogenous RNA molecules that regulate mRNA expression. Recent evidence suggests miRNAs play an important role in the five major hallmarks of AD pathophysiology: amyloidogenesis, tauopathy, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death. Compared to traditional biomarkers of AD, miRNAs display a greater degree of stability in cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, aberrant changes in miRNA expression can be measured over time to monitor and guide patient treatment. Specific miRNA profiles and combinations may also be used to distinguish AD subjects from normal controls and other causes of dementia. Because of these properties, miRNAs are now being considered as promising and potential biomarkers of AD.

Proteomics analysis of plasma from middle-aged adults identifies protein markers of dementia risk in later life.,"A diverse set of biological processes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. However, there is limited understanding of the peripheral biological mechanisms relevant in the earliest phases of the disease. Here, we used a large-scale proteomics platform to examine the association of 4877 plasma proteins with 25-year dementia risk in 10,981 middle-aged adults. We found 32 dementia-associated plasma proteins that were involved in proteostasis, immunity, synaptic function, and extracellular matrix organization. We then replicated the association between 15 of these proteins and clinically relevant neurocognitive outcomes in two independent cohorts. We demonstrated that 12 of these 32 dementia-associated proteins were associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD, neurodegeneration, or neuroinflammation. We found that eight of these candidate protein markers were abnormally expressed in human postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD, although some of the proteins that were most strongly associated with dementia risk, such as GDF15, were not detected in these brain tissue samples. Using network analyses, we found a protein signature for dementia risk that was characterized by dysregulation of specific immune and proteostasis/autophagy pathways in adults in midlife ~20 years before dementia onset, as well as abnormal coagulation and complement signaling ~10 years before dementia onset. Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization genetically validated nine of our candidate proteins as markers of AD in midlife and inferred causality of SERPINA3 in AD pathogenesis.

Cognitive effects of Lewy body pathology in clinically unimpaired individuals.,"α-Synuclein aggregates constitute the pathology of Lewy body (LB) disease. Little is known about the effects of LB pathology in preclinical (presymptomatic) individuals, either as isolated pathology or coexisting with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau). We examined the effects of LB pathology using a cerebrospinal fluid α-synuclein-seed amplification assay in 1,182 cognitively and neurologically unimpaired participants from the BioFINDER study: 8% were LB positive, 26% Aβ positive (13% of those were LB positive) and 16% tau positive. LB positivity occurred more often in the presence of Aβ positivity but not tau positivity. LB pathology had independently negative effects on cross-sectional and longitudinal global cognition and memory and on longitudinal attention/executive function. Tau had cognitive effects of a similar magnitude, but these were less pronounced for Aβ. Participants with both LB and AD (Aβ and tau) pathology exhibited faster cognitive decline than those with only LB or AD pathology. LB, but not AD, pathology was associated with reduced sense of smell. Only LB-positive participants progressed to clinical LB disease over 10 years.

Twenty-three percent had LB pathology, of which only 21% fulfilled clinical criteria of Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies at baseline. Among these LB-positive patients, 48% had AD pathology. Fifty-four percent had AD pathology in the whole sample (17% of mild cognitive impairment and 24% of patients with dementia were also LB-positive). When examining independent cross-sectional effects, LB pathology but not amyloid-β or tau, was associated with hallucinations and worse attention/executive, visuospatial and motor function. LB pathology was also associated with faster longitudinal decline in all examined cognitive functions, independent of amyloid-β, tau, cognitive stage and a baseline diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease.

The -omics methods (genomics, RNomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are useful at measuring thousands of markers in a small volume. Saliva is a human fluid that is easily accessible, without any ethical concerns. Yet, saliva remains unexplored in regard to many human disease biomarkers. In this review, we will give an overview on saliva and how it can be influenced by exogenous factors. As we focus on the potential use of saliva as a diagnostic tool in brain disorders (especially Alzheimer's disease), we will cover how saliva is linked to the brain. We will discuss that saliva is a heterogeneous human fluid, yet useful for the discovery of biomarkers in human disorders. However, a procedure and consensus that is controlled, validated, and standardized for the collection and processing of saliva is required, followed by a highly sensitive diagnostic approach.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; diagnosis; oral-gut-brain axis; periodontitis; saliva,,"Zürcher, C; Humpel, C"

Central and Peripheral Inflammation in Mild Cognitive Impairment in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by an abnormal decline in mental and cognitive function compared with normal cognitive aging. It is an underlying condition of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. In recent years, neuroinflammation has been investigated as a new leading target that contributes to MCI progression into AD. Understanding the mechanism underlying inflammatory processes involved in the early onset of the disease could help find a safe and effective way to diagnose and treat patients. In this article, we assessed over twenty different blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory biomarker concentrations with immunoassay methods in patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment), non-impaired control (NIC), and serum healthy control (HC). We performed group comparisons and analyzed in-group correlations between the biomarkers. We included 107 participants (mean age: 64.7 ± 7.8, women: 58.9%). CSF osteopontin and YKL-40 were significantly increased in the MCI group, whereas serum C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were significantly higher (",2023,biomarkers; inflammasome; interleukin-1β; mild cognitive impairment; neuroinflammation,Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Interleukin-1beta; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Inflammation; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Schmidt-Morgenroth, I; Michaud, P; Gasparini, F; Avrameas, A"
Assessment of Aggregated and Exosome-Associated α-Synuclein in Brain Tissue and Cerebrospinal Fluid Using Specific Immunoassays.,"Even though it is currently well-established that α-synuclein aggregation is closely associated with the pathological events in Parkinson's disease (PD) and several other neurodegenerative disorders, collectively called synucleinopathies, the mechanistic link between α-synuclein aggregates and the onset and progression of neurodegeneration in these diseases remain unclear. The process of aggregation initiates from a structurally distorted monomer that gradually oligomerizes to generate a repertoire of fibrillar and oligomeric multimers that deposit within diseased cells in the brain. Total α-synuclein has been proposed as a potential biomarker in PD, but most of the studies do not discriminate between distinct α-synuclein conformers. To correlate protein measurements to disease pathology, we have developed a conformation-specific ELISA method that selectively detects fibrillar and oligomeric forms of α-synuclein without cross-reacting with monomers. We have used this assay to determine the levels of aggregated α-synuclein in human and mouse brain tissue as well as in CSF and CSF-derived exosomes from patients with synucleinopathy and control subjects. Our results verify the ability of the new assay to detect aggregated α-synuclein in complex matrices and support the idea that the levels of these conformers are related to the age of onset in PD patients, while CSF analysis showed that these species exist in low abundance in CSF and CSF-derived exosomes. Future studies will be required to fully assess the diagnostic usefulness of this ELISA in synucleinopathies.",2023,CSF; ELISA; Parkinson’s Disease; exosomes; fibrils; synucleinopathies; α-synuclein,,"Anagnostou, D; Sfakianaki, G; Melachroinou, K; Soutos, M; Constantinides, V; Vaikath, N; Tsantzali, I; Paraskevas, GP; Agnaf, OE; Vekrellis, K; Emmanouilidou, E"
CSF MTBR-tau243 is a specific biomarker of tau tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Aggregated insoluble tau is one of two defining features of Alzheimer's disease. Because clinical symptoms are strongly correlated with tau aggregates, drug development and clinical diagnosis need cost-effective and accessible specific fluid biomarkers of tau aggregates; however, recent studies suggest that the fluid biomarkers currently available cannot specifically track tau aggregates. We show that the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) of tau containing the residue 243 (MTBR-tau243) is a new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker specific for insoluble tau aggregates and compared it to multiple other phosphorylated tau measures (p-tau181, p-tau205, p-tau217 and p-tau231) in two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, n = 448; and Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, n = 219). MTBR-tau243 was most strongly associated with tau-positron emission tomography (PET) and cognition, whereas showing the lowest association with amyloid-PET. In combination with p-tau205, MTBR-tau243 explained most of the total variance in tau-PET burden (0.58 ≤ R",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Horie, K; Salvadó, G; Barthélemy, NR; Janelidze, S; Li, Y; He, Y; Saef, B; Chen, CD; Jiang, H; Strandberg, O; Pichet Binette, A; Palmqvist, S; Sato, C; Sachdev, P; Koyama, A; Gordon, BA; Benzinger, TLS; Holtzman, DM; Morris, JC; Mattsson-Carlgren, N; Stomrud, E; Ossenkoppele, R; Schindler, SE; Hansson, O; Bateman, RJ"
inMTSCCA: An Integrated Multi-task Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multi-omic Brain Imaging Genetics.,"Identifying genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. To date, different endophenotypes, such as imaging-derived endophenotypes and proteomic expression-derived endophenotypes, have shown the great value in uncovering risk genes compared to case-control studies. Biologically, a co-varying pattern of different omics-derived endophenotypes could result from the shared genetic basis. However, existing methods mainly focus on the effect of endophenotypes alone; the effect of cross-endophenotype (CEP) associations remains largely unexploited. In this study, we used both endophenotypes and their CEP associations of multi-omic data to identify genetic risk factors, and proposed two integrated multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis (inMTSCCA) methods, i.e., pairwise endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (pcMTSCCA) and high-order endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (hocMTSCCA). pcMTSCCA employed pairwise correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived, plasma-derived, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived endophenotypes as an additional penalty. hocMTSCCA used high-order correlations among these multi-omic data for regularization. To figure out genetic risk factors at individual and group levels, as well as altered endophenotypic markers, we introduced sparsity-inducing penalties for both models. We compared pcMTSCCA and hocMTSCCA with three related methods on both simulation and real (consisting of neuroimaging data, proteomic analytes, and genetic data) datasets. The results showed that our methods obtained better or comparable canonical correlation coefficients (CCCs) and better feature subsets than benchmarks. Most importantly, the identified genetic loci and heterogeneous endophenotypic markers showed high relevance. Therefore, jointly using multi-omic endophenotypes and their CEP associations is promising to reveal genetic risk factors.

Multi-transcriptomics reveals brain cellular responses to peripheral infection in Alzheimer's disease model mice.,"Peripheral inflammation has been linked to various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we perform bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics in APP/PS1 mice intranasally exposed to Staphylococcus aureus to determine how low-grade peripheral infection affects brain transcriptomics and AD-like pathology. Chronic exposure led to increased amyloid plaque burden and plaque-associated microglia, significantly affecting the transcription of brain barrier-associated cells, which resulted in barrier leakage. We reveal cell-type- and spatial-specific transcriptional changes related to brain barrier function and neuroinflammation during the acute infection. Both acute and chronic exposure led to brain macrophage-associated responses and detrimental effects in neuronal transcriptomics. Finally, we identify unique transcriptional responses at the amyloid plaque niches following acute infection characterized by higher disease-associated microglia gene expression and a larger effect on astrocytic or macrophage-associated genes, which could facilitate amyloid and related pathologies.

Peripherin is a biomarker of axonal damage in peripheral nervous system disease.,"Valid, responsive blood biomarkers specific to peripheral nerve damage would improve management of peripheral nervous system (PNS) diseases. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is sensitive for detecting axonal pathology but is not specific to PNS damage, as it is expressed throughout the PNS and CNS. Peripherin, another intermediate filament protein, is almost exclusively expressed in peripheral nerve axons. We postulated that peripherin would be a promising blood biomarker of PNS axonal damage. We demonstrated that peripherin is distributed in sciatic nerve, and to a lesser extent spinal cord tissue lysates, but not in brain or extra-neural tissues. In the spinal cord, anti-peripherin antibody bound only to the primary cells of the periphery (anterior horn cells, motor axons and primary afferent sensory axons). In vitro models of antibody-mediated axonal and demyelinating nerve injury showed marked elevation of peripherin levels only in axonal damage and only a minimal rise in demyelination. We developed an immunoassay using single molecule array technology for the detection of serum peripherin as a biomarker for PNS axonal damage. We examined longitudinal serum peripherin and NfL concentrations in individuals with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS, n = 45, 179 time points), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP, n = 35, 70 time points), multiple sclerosis (n = 30), dementia (as non-inflammatory CNS controls, n = 30) and healthy individuals (n = 24). Peak peripherin levels were higher in GBS than all other groups (median 18.75 pg/ml versus < 6.98 pg/ml, P < 0.0001). Peak NfL was highest in GBS (median 220.8 pg/ml) and lowest in healthy controls (median 5.6 pg/ml), but NfL did not distinguish between CIDP (17.3 pg/ml), multiple sclerosis (21.5 pg/ml) and dementia (29.9 pg/ml). While peak NfL levels were higher with older age (rho = +0.39, P < 0.0001), peak peripherin levels did not vary with age. In GBS, local regression analysis of serial peripherin in the majority of individuals with three or more time points of data (16/25) displayed a rise-and-fall pattern with the highest value within the first week of initial assessment. Similar analysis of serial NfL concentrations showed a later peak at 16 days. Group analysis of serum peripherin and NfL levels in GBS and CIDP patients were not significantly associated with clinical data, but in some individuals with GBS, peripherin levels appeared to better reflect clinical outcome measure improvement.

Gut microbiota regulates blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier function and Aβ pathology.,"Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In contrast, the influence of gut microbiota on the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier has not yet been studied. Here, we report that mice lacking gut microbiota display increased blood-CSF barrier permeability associated with disorganized tight junctions (TJs), which can be rescued by recolonization with gut microbiota or supplementation with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Our data reveal that gut microbiota is important not only for the establishment but also for the maintenance of a tight barrier. Also, we report that the vagus nerve plays an important role in this process and that SCFAs can independently tighten the barrier.

Nanotechnology-based Drug Delivery for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.,"The delivery of drugs to the brain is quite challenging in the treatment of the central nervous system (CNS) diseases due to the blood-brain barrier and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, significant developments in nanomaterials employed by nanoparticle drug-delivery systems have substantial potential to cross or bypass these barriers leading to enhanced therapeutic efficacies. Advances in nanoplatform, nanosystems based on lipids, polymers and inorganic materials have been extensively studied and applied in treating Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

Detection of β-amyloid aggregates/plaques in 5xFAD mice by labelled native PLGA nanoparticles: implication in the diagnosis of alzheimer's disease.,"Evidence suggests that increased level/aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, together with enhanced phosphorylation/aggregation of tau protein, play a critical role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. At present, AD diagnosis is based primarily on cognitive assessment, neuroimaging, and immunological assays to detect altered levels/deposition of Aβ peptides and tau protein. While measurement of Aβ and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid/blood can indicate disease status, neuroimaging of aggregated Aβ and tau protein in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) enable to monitor the pathological changes in AD patients. With advancements in nanomedicine, several nanoparticles, apart from drug-delivery, have been used as a diagnostic agent to identify more accurately changes in AD patients. Recently, we reported that FDA approved native PLGA nanoparticles can interact with Aβ to inhibit its aggregation/toxicity in cellular and animal models of AD. Here, we reveal that fluorescence labelled native PLGA following acute intracerebellar injection can identify majority of the immunostained Aβ as well as Congo red labelled neuritic plaques in the cortex of 5xFAD mice. Labelling of plaques by PLGA is apparent at 1 h, peak around 3 h and then start declining by 24 h after injection. No fluorescent PLGA was detected in the cerebellum of 5xFAD mice or in any brain regions of wild-type control mice following injection.

Proteome wide association studies of LRRK2 variants identify novel causal and druggable proteins for Parkinson's disease.,"Common and rare variants in the LRRK2 locus are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk, but the downstream effects of these variants on protein levels remain unknown. We performed comprehensive proteogenomic analyses using the largest aptamer-based CSF proteomics study to date (7006 aptamers (6138 unique proteins) in 3107 individuals). The dataset comprised six different and independent cohorts (five using the SomaScan7K (ADNI, DIAN, MAP, Barcelona-1 (Pau), and Fundació ACE (Ruiz)) and the PPMI cohort using the SomaScan5K panel). We identified eleven independent SNPs in the LRRK2 locus associated with the levels of 25 proteins as well as PD risk. Of these, only eleven proteins have been previously associated with PD risk (e.g., GRN or GPNMB). Proteome-wide association study (PWAS) analyses suggested that the levels of ten of those proteins were genetically correlated with PD risk, and seven were validated in the PPMI cohort. Mendelian randomization analyses identified GPNMB, LCT, and CD68 causal for PD and nominate one more (ITGB2). These 25 proteins were enriched for microglia-specific proteins and trafficking pathways (both lysosome and intracellular). This study not only demonstrates that protein phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and trans-protein quantitative trail loci (pQTL) analyses are powerful for identifying novel protein interactions in an unbiased manner, but also that LRRK2 is linked with the regulation of PD-associated proteins that are enriched in microglial cells and specific lysosomal pathways.",2023,,,"Phillips, B; Western, D; Wang, L; Timsina, J; Sun, Y; Gorijala, P; Yang, C; Do, A; Nykänen, NP; Alvarez, I; Aguilar, M; Pastor, P; Morris, JC; Schindler, SE; Fagan, AM; Puerta, R; García-González, P; de Rojas, I; Marquié, M; Boada, M; Ruiz, A; Perlmutter, JS; Ibanez, L; Perrin, RJ; Sung, YJ; Cruchaga, C"

MicroRNAs in Extracellular Vesicles of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with dysfunction of memory, language and thinking. More than 55 million people were diagnosed with AD or other dementia around the world in 2020. The pathology of AD is still unclear and there are no applicable therapies for AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in AD pathology and have great potential for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) widely exist in body fluids such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and contain miRNAs that are involved in cell-to-cell communication. We summarized the dysregulated miRNAs in EVs derived from the different body fluids of AD patients, as well as their potential function and application in AD. We also compared these dysregulated miRNAs in EVs to those in the brain tissues of AD patients aiming to provide a comprehensive view of miRNAs in AD. After careful comparisons, we found that miR-125b-5p and miR-132-3p were upregulated and downregulated in several different brain tissues of AD and EVs of AD, respectively, suggesting their value in AD diagnosis based on EV miRNAs. Furthermore, miR-9-5p was dysregulated in EVs and different brain tissues of AD patients and had also been tested as a potential therapy for AD in mice and human cell models, suggesting that miR-9-5p could be used to design new therapies for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood; brain; cerebrospinal fluid; extracellular vesicles; microRNA,Humans; Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; MicroRNAs; Extracellular Vesicles,"Li, W; Zheng, Y"

It is not clear whether concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in the central nervous system predict later brain and cognitive changes over time nor whether this relationship is mediated by core AD biomarkers. Here, 219 cognitively healthy older adults (62-91 years), with baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of IL-6 and IL-8 were followed over time - up to 9 years - with assessments that included cognitive function, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and CSF measurements of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-β (Aβ-42) concentrations (for a subsample). Higher baseline CSF IL-8 was associated with better memory performance over time in the context of lower levels of CSF p-tau and p-tau/Aβ-42 ratio.

Alzheimer-type cerebral amyloidosis in the context of HIV infection: implications for a proposed new treatment approach.,"Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) are currently broadly prescribed for the treatment of HIV infection but are also thought to prevent Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression by protecting against amyloidosis. Our study evaluates the hypothesis that reverse transcriptase inhibitors protect against Alzheimer-type brain amyloidogenesis in the context of HIV infection. We compiled a case series of participants from a prospective study of the neurological consequences of HIV infection at the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP) who had serial neuropsychological and neurological assessments and were on RTIs. Two participants had gross and microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry of the brain at autopsy; one was assessed clinically for Alzheimer's Disease by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis of phosphorylated-Tau, Total-Tau and Aβ42. Additionally, a larger cohort of autopsied individuals was evaluated for presence of amyloid plaques, Tau, and related pathologies. Three older, virally suppressed individuals with HIV who had long-term treatment with RTIs were included in analyses. Two cases demonstrated substantial cerebral amyloid deposition at autopsy. The third case met clinical criteria for AD based on a typical clinical course and CSF biomarker profile. In the larger cohort of autopsied individuals, the prevalence of cerebral amyloidosis among people with HIV (PWH) was greater for those on RTIs. Our study showed that long-term RTI therapy did not protect against Alzheimer-type brain amyloidogenesis in the context of HIV infection in these patients. Given the known toxicities of RTIs, it is premature to recommend them to individuals at risk or with Alzheimer's disease who do not have HIV infection.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; HIV; amyloid; cerebral amyloidosis; reverse transcriptase inhibitors,,"Ellis, RJ; Pal, S; Achim, CL; Sundermann, E; Moore, DJ; Soontornniyomkij, V; Feldman, H"
KIBRA repairs synaptic plasticity and promotes resilience to tauopathy-related memory loss.,"Synaptic plasticity is obstructed by pathogenic tau in the brain, representing a key mechanism that underlies memory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Here, we define a mechanism for plasticity repair in vulnerable neurons using the C-terminus of the KIdney/BRAin (KIBRA) protein (CT-KIBRA). We show that CT-KIBRA restores plasticity and memory in transgenic mice expressing pathogenic human tau; however, CT-KIBRA did not alter tau levels or prevent tau-induced synapse loss. Instead, we find that CT-KIBRA binds to and stabilizes protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) to maintain synaptic plasticity and memory despite tau-mediated pathogenesis. In humans we find that reduced KIBRA in brain and increased KIBRA in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with cognitive impairment and pathological tau levels in disease. Thus, our results distinguish KIBRA both as a novel biomarker of synapse dysfunction in AD and as the foundation for a synapse repair mechanism to reverse cognitive impairment in tauopathy.",2023,,,"Kauwe, G; Pareja-Navarro, KA; Yao, L; Chen, JH; Wong, I; Saloner, R; Cifuentes, H; Nana, AL; Shah, S; Li, Y; Le, D; Spina, S; Grinberg, LT; Seeley, WW; Kramer, JH; Sacktor, TC; Schilling, B; Gan, L; Casaletto, KB; Tracy, TE"

Thalamic nuclei changes in early and late onset Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Increasing evidence points to the thalamus as an important hub in the clinical symptomatology of the disease, with the 'limbic thalamus' been described as especially vulnerable. In this work, we examined thalamic atrophy in early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) compared to young and old healthy controls (YHC and OHC, respectively) using a recently developed cutting-edge thalamic nuclei segmentation method. A deep learning variant of Thalamus Optimized Multi Atlas Segmentation (THOMAS) was used to parcellate 11 thalamic nuclei per hemisphere from T1-weighted MRI in 88 biomarker-confirmed AD patients (49 EOAD and 39 LOAD) and 58 healthy controls (41 YHC and 17 OHC) with normal AD biomarkers. Nuclei volumes were compared among groups using MANCOVA. Further, Pearson's correlation coefficient was computed between thalamic nuclear volume and cortical-subcortical regions, CSF tau levels, and neuropsychological scores. The results showed widespread thalamic nuclei atrophy in EOAD and LOAD compared to their respective healthy control groups, with EOAD showing additional atrophy in the centromedian and ventral lateral posterior nuclei compared to YHC. In EOAD, increased thalamic nuclei atrophy was associated with posterior parietal atrophy and worse visuospatial abilities, while LOAD thalamic nuclei atrophy was preferentially associated with medial temporal atrophy and worse episodic memory and executive function. Our findings suggest that thalamic nuclei may be differentially affected in AD according to the age at symptoms onset, associated with specific cortical-subcortical regions, CSF total tau and cognition.",2023,Early onset Alzheimer's disease; Late onset Alzheimer's disease; THOMAS-DL; Thalamic nuclei; Thalamus,,"Forno, G; Saranathan, M; Contador, J; Guillen, N; Falgàs, N; Tort-Merino, A; Balasa, M; Sanchez-Valle, R; Hornberger, M; Lladó, A"

PCA-WRKNN-assisted label-free SERS serum analysis platform enabling non-invasive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder with significant economic and societal impacts, whereas early AD diagnosis remains a considerable challenge. Here, a robust and convenient surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) analysis platform was fabricated on a microarray chip to dissect the variation in serum composition for AD diagnosis, eliminating the invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based and costly instrument-dependent diagnostic methods. AuNOs array prepared by self-assembly at liquid-liquid interface enabled the acquirement of SERS spectra with excellent reproducibility. Moreover, a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation suggested the significant plasmon hybridization generated by AuNOs aggregation, resulting in high signal-to-noise ratio SERS spectra. We established an AD mice model with Aβ1-40 induction followed by recording the serum SERS spectra at different stages. A multivariate analysis method of principal component analysis (PCA)-weighted representation-based k-nearest neighbor (WRKNN) was applied for the characteristics extraction to improve the classification performance, with an accuracy of over 95 %, an AUC of over 90 %, a sensitivity of over 80 %, and a specificity of over 96.7 %. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of SERS application as a diagnostic screening method, following further validation and optimization, which may open up new exciting opportunities for future biomedical applications.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; K-nearest neighbor; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Multivariate Analysis; Cluster Analysis; Spectrum Analysis, Raman","Li, W; Chen, G; Chen, M; Shen, K; Wu, C; Shen, W; Zhang, F"

Discerning the Prospects of miRNAs as a Multi-Target Therapeutic and Diagnostic for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Although over the last few decades, numerous attempts have been made to halt Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and mitigate its symptoms, only a few have been proven beneficial. Most medications available, still only cater to the symptoms of the disease rather than fixing the cause at the root level. A novel approach involving the use of miRNAs, which work on the principle of gene silencing, is being explored by scientists. Naturally present miRNAs in the biological system help to regulate various genes than may be implicated in AD-like BACE-1 and APP. One miRNA thus, holds the power to keep a check on several genes, conferring it the ability to be used as a multi-target therapeutic. With aging and the onset of diseased pathology, dysregulation of these miRNAs is observed. This flawed miRNA expression is responsible for the unusual buildup of amyloid proteins, fibrillation of tau proteins in the brain, neuronal death and other hallmarks leading to AD. The use of miRNA mimics and miRNA inhibitors provides an attractive perspective for fixing the upregulation and downregulation of miRNAs that led to abnormal cellular activities. Furthermore, the detection of miRNAs in the CSF and serum of diseased patients might be considered an earlier biomarker for the disease. While most of the therapies designed around AD have not succeeded completely, the targeting of dysregulated miRNAs in AD patients might give a new direction to scholars to develop an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; RNA interference; miRNA; miRNA inhibitors; miRNA mimics; siRNA,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; MicroRNAs; tau Proteins; Brain; Up-Regulation,"Bhatnagar, D; Ladhe, S; Kumar, D"

Charting the Next Road Map for CSF Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.,"Clinical prediction of underlying pathologic substrates in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia or related dementia syndromes (ADRD) has limited accuracy. Etiologic biomarkers - including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of AD proteins and cerebral amyloid PET imaging - have greatly modernized disease-modifying clinical trials in AD, but their integration into medical practice has been slow. Beyond core CSF AD biomarkers (including beta-amyloid 1-42, total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181), novel biomarkers have been interrogated in single- and multi-centered studies with uneven rigor. Here, we review early expectations for ideal AD/ADRD biomarkers, assess these goals' future applicability, and propose study designs and performance thresholds for meeting these ideals with a focus on CSF biomarkers. We further propose three new characteristics: equity (oversampling of diverse populations in the design and testing of biomarkers), access (reasonable availability to 80% of people at risk for disease, along with pre- and post-biomarker processes), and reliability (thorough evaluation of pre-analytical and analytical factors influencing measurements and performance). Finally, we urge biomarker scientists to balance the desire and evidence for a biomarker to reflect its namesake function, indulge data- as well as theory-driven associations, re-visit the subset of rigorously measured CSF biomarkers in large datasets (such as Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative), and resist the temptation to favor ease over fail-safe in the development phase. This shift from discovery to application, and from suspended disbelief to cogent ingenuity, should allow the AD/ADRD biomarker field to live up to its billing during the next phase of neurodegenerative disease research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF biomarkers; Cerebrospinal fluid; Dementias; Validation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Reproducibility of Results; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Hu, WT; Nayyar, A; Kaluzova, M"
"Impact of asthma on the brain: evidence from diffusion MRI, CSF biomarkers and cognitive decline.","Chronic systemic inflammation increases the risk of neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Part of the challenge in reaching a nuanced understanding is the presence of multiple risk factors that interact to potentiate adverse consequences. To address modifiable risk factors and mitigate downstream effects, it is necessary, although difficult, to tease apart the contribution of an individual risk factor by accounting for concurrent factors such as advanced age, cardiovascular risk, and genetic predisposition. Using a case-control design, we investigated the influence of asthma, a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, on brain health in participants recruited to the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (31 asthma patients, 186 non-asthma controls, aged 45-90 years, 62.2% female, 92.2% cognitively unimpaired), a sample enriched for parental history of Alzheimer's disease. Asthma status was determined using detailed prescription information. We employed multi-shell diffusion weighted imaging scans and the three-compartment neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging model to assess white and gray matter microstructure. We used cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to examine evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology, glial activation, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. We evaluated cognitive changes over time using a preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite. Using permutation analysis of linear models, we examined the moderating influence of asthma on relationships between diffusion imaging metrics, CSF biomarkers, and cognitive decline, controlling for age, sex, and cognitive status. We ran additional models controlling for cardiovascular risk and genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease, defined as a carrier of at least one apolipoprotein E (",2023,CSF biomarkers; asthma; cognition; dementia; diffusion MRI,,"Nair, AK; Van Hulle, CA; Bendlin, BB; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Wild, N; Kollmorgen, G; Suridjan, I; Busse, WW; Dean, DC; Rosenkranz, MA"
The Importance of Subjective Cognitive Decline Recognition and the Potential of Molecular and Neurophysiological Biomarkers-A Systematic Review.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neurophysiological markers such as electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) are emerging as alternatives to traditional molecular and imaging markers. This paper aimed to review the literature on EEG and ERP markers in individuals with SCD. We analysed 30 studies that met our criteria, with 17 focusing on resting-state or cognitive task EEG, 11 on ERPs, and two on both EEG and ERP parameters. Typical spectral changes were indicative of EEG rhythm slowing and were associated with faster clinical progression, lower education levels, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers profiles. Some studies found no difference in ERP components between SCD subjects, controls, or MCI, while others reported lower amplitudes in the SCD group compared to controls. Further research is needed to explore the prognostic value of EEG and ERP in relation to molecular markers in individuals with SCD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; mild cognitive impairment; subjective cognitive decline,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests,"Ulbl, J; Rakusa, M"
FAST (Flexible Acetylcholine Sensing Thread): Real-Time Detection of Acetylcholine with a Flexible Solid-Contact Potentiometric Sensor.,"Acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in memory and learning and has implications in neurodegenerative diseases; it is therefore important to study the dynamics of ACh in the brain. This work creates a flexible solid-contact potentiometric sensor for in vitro and in vivo recording of ACh in the brain and tissue homogenate. We fabricate this sensor using a 250 μm diameter cotton yarn coated with a flexible conductive ink and an ACh sensing membrane that contains a calix[4]arene ionophore. The exposed ion-to-electron transducer was sealed with a 2.5 μm thick Parylene C coating to maintain the flexibility of the sensor. The resulting diameter of the flexible ACh sensing thread (FAST) was 400 μm. The FAST showed a linear response range from 1.0 μM to 10.0 mM in deionized water, with a near-Nernstian slope of 56.11 mV/decade and a limit of detection of 2.6 μM. In artificial cerebrospinal fluid, the limit of detection increased to 20 μM due to the background signal of ionic content of the cerebrospinal fluid. The FAST showed a signal stability of 226 μV/h over 24 h. We show that FAST can measure ACh dynamics in sheep brain tissue and sheep brain homogenate after ACh spiking. FAST is the first flexible electrochemical sensor for monitoring ACh dynamics in the brain.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; acetylcholine; cholinergic signaling; electrochemical sensor; flexible sensor; neural probe; neurotransmitter; solid-contact potentiometric sensor,,"Amirghasemi, F; Soleimani, A; Bawarith, S; Tabassum, A; Morrel, A; Mousavi, MPS"

Revisiting the neuroinflammation hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease: a focus on the druggability of current targets.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease and disability in the elderly; it is estimated to account for 60%-70% of all cases of dementia worldwide. The most relevant mechanistic hypothesis to explain AD symptoms is neurotoxicity induced by aggregated amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and misfolded tau protein. These molecular entities are seemingly insufficient to explain AD as a multifactorial disease characterized by synaptic dysfunction, cognitive decline, psychotic symptoms, chronic inflammatory environment within the central nervous system (CNS), activated microglial cells, and dysfunctional gut microbiota. The discovery that AD is a neuroinflammatory disease linked to innate immunity phenomena started in the early nineties by several authors, including the ICC´s group that described, in 2004, the role IL-6 in AD-type phosphorylation of tau protein in deregulating the cdk5/p35 pathway. The ""Theory of Neuroimmunomodulation"", published in 2008, proposed the onset and progression of degenerative diseases as a multi-component ""damage signals"" phenomena, suggesting the feasibility of ""multitarget"" therapies in AD. This theory explains in detail the cascade of molecular events stemming from microglial disorder through the overactivation of the Cdk5/p35 pathway. All these knowledge have led to the rational search for inflammatory druggable targets against AD. The accumulated evidence on increased levels of inflammatory markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients, along with reports describing CNS alterations caused by senescent immune cells in neuro-degenerative diseases, set out a conceptual framework in which the neuroinflammation hypothesis is being challenged from different angles towards developing new therapies against AD. The current evidence points to controversial findings in the search for therapeutic candidates to treat neuroinflammation in AD. In this article, we discuss a neuroimmune-modulatory perspective for pharmacological exploration of molecular targets against AD, as well as potential deleterious effects of modifying neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. We specifically focus on the role of B and T cells, immuno-senescence, the brain lymphatic system (BLS), gut-brain axis alterations, and dysfunctional interactions between neurons, microglia and astrocytes. We also outline a rational framework for identifying ""druggable"" targets for multi-mechanistic small molecules with therapeutic potential against AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; B and T cells; brain lymphatic system; druggable targets; immuno-senescence; neuroimmunomodulation; neuroinflammation,,"Wong-Guerra, M; Calfio, C; Maccioni, RB; Rojo, LE"
Case report: Evolution of catatonic mutism and psychotic symptoms in an adolescent with Down syndrome: transition from Down syndrome disintegrative disorder to anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.,"During her first year of junior high school, a 12-year-old Japanese girl with Down syndrome experienced dizziness, gait disruption, paroxysmal weakness in her hands, and sluggish speaking. Regular blood tests and a brain MRI revealed no abnormalities, and she was tentatively diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Nine months later, the patient experienced a subacute sickness of chest pain, nausea, sleep problem with night terrors, and delusion of observation. Rapid deterioration then developed with simultaneous fever, akinetic mutism, loss of facial expression, and urine incontinence. These catatonic symptoms improved after a few weeks after admission and treatment with lorazepam, escitalopram, and aripiprazole. After discharge, nonetheless, daytime slumber, empty eyes, paradoxical laughter, and declined verbal communication persisted. Upon confirmation of the cerebrospinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoantibody, methylprednisolone pulse therapy was tried, but it had little effect. Visual hallucinations and cenesthopathy, as well as suicidal thoughts and delusions of death, have predominated in the following years. Cerebrospinal IL-1ra, IL-5, IL-15, CCL5, G-CSF, PDGFbb, and VFGF were raised in the early stage of initial medical attention with nonspecific complaints, but were less prominent in the later stages of catatonic mutism and psychotic symptoms.

Diagnostic Biomarkers of Amyloid and Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease: An Overview of Tests for Clinical Practice in the United States and Europe.,"Amyloid and tau biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease are widely recognized diagnostic tools for the identification of Alzheimer's disease pathology antemortem and are recommended by the most recent clinical and research guidelines. Approved biomarkers include positron emission tomography (PET)- and fluid-based markers derived from cerebrospinal fluid and, more recently, plasma. These biomarkers are still infrequently used in clinical practice, potentially due to challenges in access to and understanding of individual assay information and methodology. We provide an overview of the diagnostic biomarkers for amyloid and tau pathology that are currently available in the US and/or EU for clinical use. Available performance data from both labels/instructions for use and the scientific literature (with focus on autopsy or PET as standard of truth) are summarized to help healthcare providers navigate the biomarker landscape. All available PET amyloid and tau biomarkers demonstrate high accuracy in identifying amyloid and tau Alzheimer's disease pathology, respectively, at autopsy. Among cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, all showed accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease pathology, either based on autopsy or PET findings; greater accuracy was evident for concentration ratios (Aβ42/40 or P-tau181/Aβ42) versus individual biomarker concentrations. Among plasma biomarkers, Aβ42/40 and P-tau181 demonstrated high agreement with PET findings. Overall, we conclude that commercially available PET, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma assays accurately identify Alzheimer's disease amyloid and tau pathology. The recent development of fully automated tests for fluid-based biomarkers improves test reliability.

The microRNA-485-3p concentration in salivary exosome-enriched extracellular vesicles is related to amyloid β deposition in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive long-term memory loss and cognitive dysfunction.

Accordingly, it is only recommended for individuals exhibiting clinical symptoms of AD supported by clinical cognitive assessments. Recently, it was suggested that dysregulated microRNA-485-3p (miRNA-485-3p) in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid is closely related to pathogenesis of AD.

Effect of a 1-Year Nutritional Blend Supplementation on Plasma p-tau181 and GFAP Levels among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Secondary Analysis of the Nolan Trial.,"Observational studies and some randomized controlled trials have suggested that nutritional supplementation could be a possible intervention pathway to prevent cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

CSF proteomics in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease highlights parallels with sporadic disease.,"Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) offers a unique opportunity to study pathophysiological changes in a relatively young population with few comorbidities. A comprehensive investigation of proteome changes occurring in ADAD could provide valuable insights into AD-related biological mechanisms and uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Furthermore, ADAD might serve as a model for sporadic AD, but in-depth proteome comparisons are lacking. We aimed to identify dysregulated CSF proteins in ADAD and determine the degree of overlap with sporadic AD. We measured 1472 proteins in CSF of PSEN1 or APP mutation carriers (n = 22) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 20) from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort using proximity extension-based immunoassays (PEA). We compared protein abundance between groups with two-sided t-tests and identified enriched biological pathways. Using the same protein panels in paired plasma samples, we investigated correlations between CSF proteins and their plasma counterparts. Finally, we compared our results with recently published PEA data from an international cohort of sporadic AD (n = 230) and non-AD dementias (n = 301). All statistical analyses were false discovery rate-corrected. We detected 66 differentially abundant CSF proteins (65 increased, 1 decreased) in ADAD compared to controls (q < 0.05). The most strongly upregulated proteins (fold change >1.8) were related to immunity (CHIT1, ITGB2, SMOC2), cytoskeletal structure (MAPT, NEFL) and tissue remodelling (TMSB10, MMP-10). Significant CSF-plasma correlations were found for the upregulated proteins SMOC2 and LILR1B. Of the 66 differentially expressed proteins, 36 had been measured previously in the sporadic dementias cohort, 34 of which (94%) were also significantly upregulated in sporadic AD, with a strong correlation between the fold changes of these proteins in both cohorts (rs = 0.730, P < 0.001). Twenty-nine of the 36 proteins (81%) were also upregulated among non-AD patients with suspected AD co-pathology. This CSF proteomics study demonstrates substantial biochemical similarities between ADAD and sporadic AD, suggesting involvement of the same biological processes. Besides known AD-related proteins, we identified several relatively novel proteins, such as TMSB10, MMP-10 and SMOC2, which have potential as novel biomarkers. With shared pathophysiological CSF changes, ADAD study findings might be translatable to sporadic AD, which could greatly expedite therapy development.",2023,dementia; familial; genetic; olink; proteome,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Matrix Metalloproteinase 10; Proteomics; Proteome; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"van der Ende, EL; In 't Veld, SGJG; Hanskamp, I; van der Lee, S; Dijkstra, JIR; Hok-A-Hin, YS; Blujdea, ER; van Swieten, JC; Irwin, DJ; Chen-Plotkin, A; Hu, WT; Lemstra, AW; Pijnenburg, YAL; van der Flier, WM; Del Campo, M; Teunissen, CE; Vermunt, L"

PSEN1/SLC20A2 double mutation causes early-onset Alzheimer's disease and primary familial brain calcification co-morbidity.,"Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC; formerly Fahr's disease) and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) may share partially overlapping pathogenic principles. Although the heterozygous loss-of-function mutation c.1523 + 1G > T in the PFBC-linked gene SLC20A2 was detected in a patient with asymmetric tremor, early-onset dementia, and brain calcifications, CSF β-amyloid parameters and FBB-PET suggested cortical β-amyloid pathology. Genetic re-analysis of exome sequences revealed the probably pathogenic missense mutation c.235G > A/p.A79T in PSEN1. The SLC20A2 mutation segregated with mild calcifications in two children younger than 30 years. We thus describe the stochastically extremely unlikely co-morbidity of genetic PFBC and genetic EOAD. The clinical syndromes pointed to additive rather than synergistic effects of the two mutations. MRI data revealed the formation of PFBC calcifications decades before the probable onset of the disease.

Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid nonenzymatic protein damage is sustained in Alzheimer's disease.,Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been observed that oxidative damage to specific protein targets affecting particular functional networks is one of the mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to neuronal failure and consequently loss of cognition and AD progression. Studies are lacking in which oxidative damage is measured at both systemic and central fluid levels and in the same cohort of patients. We aimed to determine the levels of both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) nonenzymatic protein damage in patients in the continuum of AD and to evaluate the relation of this damage with clinical progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.,2023,Advanced glycation end-products; Advanced lipoxidation end-products; Alzheimer's disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Mild cognitive impairment; Plasma; Protein oxidation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E4; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Peptide Fragments,"Dakterzada, F; Jové, M; Cantero, JL; Pamplona, R; Piñoll-Ripoll, G"
Homeostasis of serine enantiomers is disrupted in the post-mortem caudate putamen and cerebrospinal fluid of living Parkinson's disease patients.,"L-serine generated in astrocytes plays a pivotal role in modulating essential neurometabolic processes, while its enantiomer, D-serine, specifically regulates NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signalling. Despite their physiological relevance in modulating cerebral activity, serine enantiomers metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), we measured D- and L-serine levels along with other amino acids known to modulate NMDAR function, such as L-glutamate, L-aspartate, D-aspartate, and glycine, in the post-mortem caudate putamen (CPu) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) of PD patients. Moreover, we examined these amino acids in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of de novo living PD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients versus subjects with other neurological disorders (OND), used as control. We found higher D-serine and L-serine levels in the CPu of PD patients but not in the SFG, a cerebral region that, in contrast to the CPu, is not innervated by nigral dopaminergic terminals. We also highlighted a significant elevation of both serine enantiomers in the CSF samples from PD but not in those of AD and ALS patients, compared with control subjects. By contrast, none or only minor changes were found in the amount of other NMDAR modulating amino acids. Our findings identify D-serine and L-serine level upregulation as a biochemical signature associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in PD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; alanine cysteine serine transporter (SLC1A4); amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; biomarkers; dopamine; ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR); serine; synaptic plasticity,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Serine; Putamen; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Alzheimer Disease; Amino Acids; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; N-Methylaspartate; Homeostasis","Di Maio, A; Nuzzo, T; Gilio, L; Serra, M; Buttari, F; Errico, F; De Rosa, A; Bassi, MS; Morelli, M; Sasabe, J; Sulzer, D; Carta, M; Centonze, D; Usiello, A"

The role of microbiome-host interactions in the development of Alzheimer´s disease.,"Alzheimer`s disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia. It is often assumed that AD is caused by an aggregation of extracellular beta-amyloid and intracellular tau-protein, supported by a recent study showing reduced brain amyloid levels and reduced cognitive decline under treatment with a beta-amyloid-binding antibody. Confirmation of the importance of amyloid as a therapeutic target notwithstanding, the underlying causes of beta-amyloid aggregation in the human brain, however, remain to be elucidated. Multiple lines of evidence point towards an important role of infectious agents and/or inflammatory conditions in the etiology of AD.

Considered the brain's first line of defense, the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and perivascular microglia work in tandem to protect the brain from circulating neurotoxic molecules like DEP. Importantly, there is a strong association between AD and BBB dysfunction, particularly in the Aβ transporter and multidrug resistant pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp).

Associations of Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Aβ and tau Levels with Renal Function.,"Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that brain-derived Aβ and tau can be cleared through transport into the periphery, and the kidneys may be vital organs involved in the clearance of Aβ and tau. However, the effects of deficiency in the clearance of Aβ and tau by the kidneys on brain AD-type pathologies in humans remain largely unknown. In this study, we first recruited 41 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 40 age- and sex-matched controls with normal renal function to analyze the associations of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with plasma Aβ and tau levels. To analyze the associations of eGFR with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, we recruited 42 cognitively normal CKD patients and 150 cognitively normal controls with CSF samples. Compared with controls with normal renal function, CKD patients had higher plasma levels of Aβ40, Aβ42 and total tau (T-tau), lower CSF levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 and higher levels of CSF T-tau/Aβ42 and phosphorylated tau (P-tau)/Aβ42. Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and T-tau levels were negatively correlated with eGFR. In addition, eGFR was negatively correlated with CSF levels of T-tau, T-tau/Aβ42, and P-tau/Aβ42 but positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Thus, this study showed that the decline in renal function was correlated with abnormal AD biomarkers and cognitive decline, which provides human evidence that renal function may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive function; Renal function; Tau; β-amyloid,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments; Kidney; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic","Sun, HL; Yao, XQ; Lei, L; Jin, WS; Bai, YD; Zeng, GH; Shi, AY; Liang, J; Zhu, L; Liu, YH; Wang, YJ; Bu, XL"

Matrix disequilibrium in Alzheimer's disease and conditions that increase Alzheimer's disease risk.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias are a leading cause of death globally and are predicted to increase in prevalence. Despite this expected increase in the prevalence of AD, we have yet to elucidate the causality of the neurodegeneration observed in AD and we lack effective therapeutics to combat the progressive neuronal loss. Throughout the past 30 years, several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have arisen to explain the causative pathologies in AD: amyloid cascade, hyper-phosphorylated tau accumulation, cholinergic loss, chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial and cerebrovascular dysfunction. Published studies in this field have also focused on changes in neuronal extracellular matrix (ECM), which is critical to synaptic formation, function, and stability. Two of the greatest non-modifiable risk factors for development of AD (aside from autosomal dominant familial AD gene mutations) are aging and APOE status, and two of the greatest modifiable risk factors for AD and related dementias are untreated major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity. Indeed, the risk of developing AD doubles for every 5 years after ≥ 65, and the ",2023,"Aging, APOE; Alzheiemer’s disease; Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPGs); extracellular matrix; major Depressive Disorder (MDD); perineuronal net (PNNs)",,"Amontree, M; Deasy, S; Turner, RS; Conant, K"
Proteomics of the astrocyte secretome reveals changes in their response to soluble oligomeric Aβ.,"Astrocytes associate with amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Astrocytes react to changes in the brain environment, including increasing concentrations of amyloid-β (Aβ). However, the precise response of astrocytes to soluble small Aβ oligomers at concentrations similar to those present in the human brain has not been addressed. In this study, we exposed astrocytes to media from neurons that express the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgene with the double Swedish mutation (APPSwe), and which contains APP-derived fragments, including soluble human Aβ oligomers. We then used proteomics to investigate changes in the astrocyte secretome. Our data show dysregulated secretion of astrocytic proteins involved in the extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal organization and increase secretion of proteins involved in oxidative stress responses and those with chaperone activity. Several of these proteins have been identified in previous transcriptomic and proteomic studies using brain tissue from human AD and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our work highlights the relevance of studying astrocyte secretion to understand the brain response to AD pathology and the potential use of these proteins as biomarkers for the disease.",2023,,Humans; Astrocytes; Proteomics; Secretome; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,"Matafora, V; Gorb, A; Yang, F; Noble, W; Bachi, A; Perez-Nievas, BG; Jimenez-Sanchez, M"
Structural irregularities in MR corpus callosal images and their association with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in Mild Cognitive Impairments.,"In this study, irregularity measures from MR images of corpus callosal brain structures in healthy and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conditions are extracted and their association with Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) biomarkers are analyzed. For this, MR images of healthy controls, Early MCI (EMCI) and Late MCI (LMCI) subjects are considered from a public database. The considered images are preprocessed and corpus callosal structure is segmented. Structural irregularity measures are extracted from the segmented regions using Fourier analysis. Statistical tests are performed to identify the significant features which can characterize the MCI stages. Association of these measures with CSF amyloid beta and tau concentrations are further investigated. Results demonstrate that Fourier spectral analysis is able to characterize the non-periodic variations in the corpus callosal structures of healthy, EMCI and LMCI MR images. The callosal irregularity measures increase as the disease progresses from healthy to LMCI. Phosphorylated tau concentrations in CSF demonstrate a positive correlation with irregularity measures across the diagnostic groups. Significant association of callosal measures and amyloid beta levels are found to be absent in MCI stages. As corpus callosal structural irregularities due to early MCI condition and their association with CSF markers remain uncharacterized in the literature, this study seems to be clinically significant for the timely intervention of pre-symptomatic MCI stages.",2023,Cerebrospinal fluid markers; Corpus Callosum; Early Mild Cognitive Impairment; Fourier analysis; Structural irregularity,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Corpus Callosum; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Shaji, S; Palanisamy, R; Swaminathan, R"
Transcranial Electromagnetic Wave Treatment: A Fountain of Healthy Longevity?,"Most diseases of older age have as their common denominator a dysfunctional immune system, wherein a low, chronic level of inflammation is present due to an imbalance of pro-inflammatory cytokines over anti-inflammatory cytokines that develops during aging (""inflamm-aging""). A gerotherapeutic that can restore the immune balance to that shared by young/middle-aged adults and many centenarians could reduce the risk of those age-related diseases and increase healthy longevity. In this perspectives paper, we discuss potential longevity interventions that are being evaluated and compare them to a novel gerotherapeutic currently being evaluated in humans-Transcranial Electromagnetic Wave Treatment (TEMT). TEMT is provided non-invasively and safety through a novel bioengineered medical device-the MemorEM-that allows for near complete mobility during in-home treatments. Daily TEMT to mild/moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients over a 2-month period rebalanced 11 of 12 cytokines in blood back to that of normal aged adults. A very similar TEMT-induced rebalancing of cytokines occurred in the CSF/brain for essentially all seven measurable cytokines. Overall inflammation in both blood and brain was dramatically reduced by TEMT over a 14-27 month period, as measured by C-Reactive Protein. In these same AD patients, a reversal of cognitive impairment was observed at 2 months into treatment, while cognitive decline was stopped over a 2½ year period of TEMT. Since most age-related diseases have the commonality of immune imbalance, it is reasonable to postulate that TEMT could rebalance the immune system in many age-related diseases as it appears to do in AD. We propose that TEMT has the potential to reduce the risk/severity of age-related diseases by rejuvenating the immune system to a younger age, resulting in reduced brain/body inflammation and a substantial increase in healthy longevity.",2023,Transcranial Electromagnetic Wave Treatment; cytokines; health span; immune imbalance; inflammation; longevity,"Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Middle Aged; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Cytokines; Inflammation; Longevity; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Electromagnetic Radiation","Arendash, G; Cao, C"
Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: Current state and future use in a transformed global healthcare landscape.,"Timely detection of the pathophysiological changes and cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly pressing because of the advent of biomarker-guided targeted therapies that may be most effective when provided early in the disease. Currently, diagnosis and management of early AD are largely guided by clinical symptoms. FDA-approved neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers can aid detection and diagnosis, but the clinical implementation of these testing modalities is limited because of availability, cost, and perceived invasiveness. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) may enable earlier and faster diagnoses as well as aid in risk assessment, early detection, prognosis, and management. Herein, we review data on BBBMs that are closest to clinical implementation, particularly those based on measures of amyloid-β peptides and phosphorylated tau species. We discuss key parameters and considerations for the development and potential deployment of these BBBMs under different contexts of use and highlight challenges at the methodological, clinical, and regulatory levels.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Delivery of Health Care; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Hampel, H; Hu, Y; Cummings, J; Mattke, S; Iwatsubo, T; Nakamura, A; Vellas, B; O'Bryant, S; Shaw, LM; Cho, M; Batrla, R; Vergallo, A; Blennow, K; Dage, J; Schindler, SE"
Practice makes imperfect: stronger implicit interference with practice in individuals at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.,"Early screening to determine patient risk of developing Alzheimer's will allow better interventions and planning but necessitates accessible methods such as behavioral biomarkers. Previously, we showed that cognitively healthy older individuals whose cerebrospinal fluid amyloid / tau ratio indicates high risk of cognitive decline experienced implicit interference during a high-effort task, signaling early changes in attention. To further investigate attention's effect on implicit interference, we analyzed two experiments completed sequentially by the same high- and low-risk individuals. We hypothesized that if attention modulates interference, practice would affect the influence of implicit distractors. Indeed, while both groups experienced a strong practice effect, the association between practice and interference effects diverged between groups: stronger practice effects correlated with more implicit interference in high-risk participants, but less interference in low-risk individuals. Furthermore, low-risk individuals showed a positive correlation between implicit interference and EEG low-range alpha event-related desynchronization when switching from high- to low-load tasks. These results demonstrate how attention impacts implicit interference and highlight early differences in cognition between high- and low-risk individuals.",2023,aging; implicit processing; practice; pre-symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease,,"Hung, SM; Adams, SW; Molloy, C; Wu, DA; Shimojo, S; Arakaki, X"

"Location of pathogenic variants in PSEN1 impacts progression of cognitive, clinical, and neurodegenerative measures in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.","Although pathogenic variants in PSEN1 leading to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) are highly penetrant, substantial interindividual variability in the rates of cognitive decline and biomarker change are observed in ADAD. We hypothesized that this interindividual variability may be associated with the location of the pathogenic variant within PSEN1. PSEN1 pathogenic variant carriers participating in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study were grouped based on whether the underlying variant affects a transmembrane (TM) or cytoplasmic (CY) protein domain within PSEN1. CY and TM carriers and variant non-carriers (NC) who completed clinical evaluation, multimodal neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture for collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as part of their participation in DIAN were included in this study. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine differences in clinical, cognitive, and biomarker measures between the NC, TM, and CY groups. While both the CY and TM groups were found to have similarly elevated Aβ compared to NC, TM carriers had greater cognitive impairment, smaller hippocampal volume, and elevated phosphorylated tau levels across the spectrum of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of disease as compared to CY, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. As distinct portions of PSEN1 are differentially involved in APP processing by γ-secretase and the generation of toxic β-amyloid species, these results have important implications for understanding the pathobiology of ADAD and accounting for a substantial portion of the interindividual heterogeneity in ongoing ADAD clinical trials.",2023,PSEN1; Presenilin-1; Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD); heterogeneity; neurodegeneration,Humans; Male; Female; Adult; Brain; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Presenilin-1; Mutation; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Biomarkers,"Schultz, SA; Shirzadi, Z; Schultz, AP; Liu, L; Fitzpatrick, CD; McDade, E; Barthelemy, NR; Renton, A; Esposito, B; Joseph-Mathurin, N; Cruchaga, C; Chen, CD; Goate, A; Allegri, RF; Benzinger, TLS; Berman, S; Chui, HC; Fagan, AM; Farlow, MR; Fox, NC; Gordon, BA; Day, GS; Graff-Radford, NR; Hassenstab, JJ; Hanseeuw, BJ; Hofmann, A; Jack, CR; Jucker, M; Karch, CM; Koeppe, RA; Lee, JH; Levey, AI; Levin, J; Martins, RN; Mori, H; Morris, JC; Noble, J; Perrin, RJ; Rosa-Neto, P; Salloway, SP; Sanchez-Valle, R; Schofield, PR; Xiong, C; Johnson, KA; Bateman, RJ; Sperling, RA; Chhatwal, JP"

Biomarkers of central and peripheral inflammation mediate the association between HIV and depressive symptoms.,"People living with HIV are at increased risk for depression, though the underlying mechanisms for this are unclear. In the general population, depression is associated with peripheral and central inflammation. Given this, and since HIV infection elicits inflammation, we hypothesised that peripheral and central inflammatory biomarkers would at least partly mediate the association between HIV and depressive symptoms. People living with HIV (n = 125) and without HIV (n = 79) from the COmorBidity in Relation to AIDS (COBRA) cohort were included in this study. Participants living with and without HIV had similar baseline characteristics. All participants living with HIV were on antiretroviral therapy and were virally suppressed. Plasma, CSF, and brain MR spectroscopy (MRS) biomarkers were measured. Using logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, we found that participants with HIV were more likely to have Any Depressive Symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score >4) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 3.27 [1.46, 8.09]). We then sequentially adjusted the models for each biomarker separately to determine the mediating role of each biomarker, with a >10% reduction in OR considered as evidence of potential mediation. Of the biomarkers analysed, MIG (-15.0%) and TNF-α (-11.4%) in plasma and MIP1-α (-21.0%) and IL-6 (-18.0%) in CSF mediated the association between HIV and depressive symptoms in this sample. None of the other soluble or neuroimaging biomarkers substantially mediated this association.

"Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA): radiological, biological and clinical characteristics.","Excess accumulation and aggregation of toxic soluble and insoluble amyloid-β species in the brain are a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Randomized clinical trials show reduced brain amyloid-β deposits using monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid-β and have identified MRI signal abnormalities called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) as possible spontaneous or treatment-related adverse events. This review provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art conceptual review of radiological features, clinical detection and classification challenges, pathophysiology, underlying biological mechanism(s) and risk factors/predictors associated with ARIA. We summarize the existing literature and current lines of evidence with ARIA-oedema/effusion (ARIA-E) and ARIA-haemosiderosis/microhaemorrhages (ARIA-H) seen across anti-amyloid clinical trials and therapeutic development. Both forms of ARIA may occur, often early, during anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibody treatment. Across randomized controlled trials, most ARIA cases were asymptomatic. Symptomatic ARIA-E cases often occurred at higher doses and resolved within 3-4 months or upon treatment cessation. Apolipoprotein E haplotype and treatment dosage are major risk factors for ARIA-E and ARIA-H. Presence of any microhaemorrhage on baseline MRI increases the risk of ARIA. ARIA shares many clinical, biological and pathophysiological features with Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. There is a great need to conceptually link the evident synergistic interplay associated with such underlying conditions to allow clinicians and researchers to further understand, deliberate and investigate on the combined effects of these multiple pathophysiological processes. Moreover, this review article aims to better assist clinicians in detection (either observed via symptoms or visually on MRI), management based on appropriate use recommendations, and general preparedness and awareness when ARIA are observed as well as researchers in the fundamental understanding of the various antibodies in development and their associated risks of ARIA. To facilitate ARIA detection in clinical trials and clinical practice, we recommend the implementation of standardized MRI protocols and rigorous reporting standards. With the availability of approved amyloid-β therapies in the clinic, standardized and rigorous clinical and radiological monitoring and management protocols are required to effectively detect, monitor, and manage ARIA in real-world clinical settings.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-related imaging abnormalities; anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; disease-modifying therapies,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Amyloid; Amyloidogenic Proteins","Hampel, H; Elhage, A; Cho, M; Apostolova, LG; Nicoll, JAR; Atri, A"

Multi-modal cross-attention network for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis with multi-modality data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, the most common cause of dementia, so the accurate diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is significant. Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information for diagnosis. Many existing multi-modal models based on deep learning simply concatenate each modality's features despite substantial differences in representation spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal cross-attention AD diagnosis (MCAD) framework to learn the interaction between modalities for better playing their complementary roles for AD diagnosis with multi-modal data including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Specifically, the imaging and non-imaging representations are learned by the image encoder based on cascaded dilated convolutions and CSF encoder, respectively. Then, a multi-modal interaction module is introduced, which takes advantage of cross-modal attention to integrate imaging and non-imaging information and reinforce relationships between these modalities. Moreover, an extensive objective function is designed to reduce the discrepancy between modalities for effectively fusing the features of multi-modal data, which could further improve the diagnosis performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the ADNI dataset, and the extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCAD achieves superior performance for multiple AD-related classification tasks, compared to several competing methods. Also, we investigate the importance of cross-attention and the contribution of each modality to the diagnostics performance. The experimental results demonstrate that combining multi-modality data via cross-attention is helpful for accurate AD diagnosis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Attention; Computer-aided diagnosis; Deep learning; Multiple modalities,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Zhang, J; He, X; Liu, Y; Cai, Q; Chen, H; Qing, L"
Comparing three neuropsychological subgrouping approaches in subjective and mild cognitive impairment from a naturalistic multicenter study.,"Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are two clinical groups with an increased risk to develop dementia, but they are highly heterogeneous. This study compared three different approaches to subgroup SCI and MCI patients and investigated their capacity to disentangle cognitive and biomarker heterogeneity. We included 792 patients from the MemClin-cohort (142 SCI and 650 MCI). Biomarkers included cerebrospinal fluid measures of beta-amyloid-42 and phosphorylated tau, as well as visual ratings of medial temporal lobe atrophy and white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. We found that a more inclusive approach identified individuals with a positive beta-amyloid-42 biomarker; a less inclusive approach captured individuals with higher medial temporal lobe atrophy; and a data-driven approach captured individuals with high white matter hyperintensities burden. The three approaches also captured some neuropsychological differences. We conclude that choice of approach may differ depending on the purpose.

Selenoprotein P concentrations and risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.,"There is a growing literature investigating the effects of selenium on the central nervous system and cognitive function. However, little is known about the role of selenoprotein P, the main selenium transporter, which can also have adverse biological effects. We conducted a prospective cohort study of individuals aged 42-81 years who received a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. Using sandwich ELISA methods, we measured full-length selenoprotein P concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid to assess the relation with dementia incidence during a median follow-up of 47.3 months. We used Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic splines to model such relation. Of the 54 participants, 35 developed dementia during follow-up (including 26 cases of Alzheimer's dementia). Selenoprotein P concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were highly correlated, and in spline regression analyses they each showed a positive non-linear association with dementia risk, particularly after excluding dementia cases diagnosed within 24 months of follow-up. We also observed differences in association according to the dementia subtypes considered. Risk ratios of dementia peaked at 2-6 at the highest levels of selenoprotein P, when compared to its median level, also depending on matrix, analytical methodology and dementia subtype. Findings of this study, the first to assess selenoprotein P levels in the central nervous system in vivo and the first to use a prospective study design to evaluate associations with dementia, suggest that higher circulating concentrations of selenoprotein P, both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, predict progression of MCI to dementia. However, further confirmation of these findings is required, given the limited statistical precision of the associations and the potential for residual confounding.",2023,,Humans; Prospective Studies; Selenoprotein P; Selenium; Disease Progression; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers,"Vinceti, M; Urbano, T; Chiari, A; Filippini, T; Wise, LA; Tondelli, M; Michalke, B; Shimizu, M; Saito, Y"

Ferroptosis Signaling Pathways: Alzheimer's Disease.,"The involvements of iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD) development have recently received a lot of attention. We also observe that these pathogenic occurrences play a key role in regulating ferroptosis, a unique regulatory cell death that is iron-dependent, oxidative, and non-apoptotic. Iron is a crucial component that makes up a subunit of the oxidase responsible for lipid peroxidation. A family of non-heme iron enzymes known as lipoxygenases (LOXs) can cause ferroptosis by oxidising polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes (PUFAs). Toxic lipid hydroperoxides are produced in large part by the iron in LOX active sites. Deferoxamine and deferiprone, two iron chelators, could also treat ferroptosis by eliminating the crucial catalytic iron from LOXs. Phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids are the main substrates of lipid peroxidation in ferroptosis, which is favourably controlled by enzymes like ACSL4, LPCAT3, ALOXs, or POR. Selective stimulation of autophagic degradation pathways leads to an increase in iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, which promotes ferroptosis. We highlighted recent advancements in our understanding of ferroptosis signaling routes in this study. One form of regulated necrotic cell death known as ferroptosis has been linked to a number of diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ferritin may be a good indicator of the amount of iron in the brain because it is the main protein that stores iron.",2023,,"Humans; Ferroptosis; Alzheimer Disease; Lipid Peroxidation; Iron; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Signal Transduction","Maheshwari, S"

Cholecystokinin Signaling can Rescue Cognition and Synaptic Plasticity in the APP/PS1 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Synaptic impairment and loss are an important pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memory is stored in neural networks through changes in synaptic activity, and synaptic dysfunction can cause cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the major neuropeptides in the brain, and plays a role as a neurotransmitter and growth factor. The level of CCK in the cerebrospinal fluid is decreased in AD patients. In this study, a novel CCK analogue was synthesized on the basis of preserving the minimum bioactive fragment of endogenous CCK to investigate whether the novel CCK analogue could improve synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD and its possible molecular biological mechanism. Our study found that the CCK analogue could effectively improve spatial learning and memory, enhance synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, normalize synapse numbers and morphology and the levels of key synaptic proteins, up-regulate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and normalize PKA, CREB, BDNF and TrkB receptor levels in APP/PS1 mice. The amyloid plaque load in the brain was reduced by CCK, too. The use of a CCKB receptor antagonist and targeted knockdown of the CCKB receptor (CCKBR) attenuated the neuroprotective effect of the CCK analogue. These results demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect of CCK analogue is achieved by activating the PI3K/Akt as well as the PKA/CREB-BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway that leads to protection of synapses and cognition.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; BDNF signaling pathway; Cholecystokinin; Learning and memory; Synaptic plasticity,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroprotective Agents; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Neuronal Plasticity; Mice, Transgenic; Cognition; Hippocampus; Cholecystokinin; Signal Transduction; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Presenilin-1","Zhang, Z; Yu, Z; Yuan, Y; Yang, J; Wang, S; Ma, H; Hao, L; Ma, J; Li, Z; Zhang, Z; Hölscher, C"
The association of obstructive sleep apnea with blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's dementia - A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized by the aggregation of extracellular amyloid-beta and intracellular hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is associated with increased AD risk. We hypothesize that OSA is associated with higher levels of AD biomarkers. The study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between OSA and levels of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD. Two authors independently searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies comparing blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of dementia biomarkers between patients with OSA and healthy controls. Meta-analyses of the standardized mean difference were conducted using random-effects models. From 18 studies with 2804 patients, meta-analysis found that cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta-40 (SMD:-1.13, 95%CI:-1.65 to -0.60), blood total amyloid beta (SMD:0.68, 95%CI: 0.40 to 0.96), blood amyloid beta-40 (SMD:0.60, 95%CI: 0.35 to 0.85), blood amyloid beta-42 (SMD:0.80, 95%CI: 0.38 to 1.23) and blood total-tau (SMD: 0.664, 95% CI: 0.257 to 1.072, I",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Biomarkers","Yeo, BSY; Koh, JH; Ng, ACW; Loh, S; See, A; Seow, DCC; Toh, ST"

Why Are Perivascular Spaces Important?,"Perivascular spaces (PVS) and their enlargement (EPVS) have been gaining interest as EPVS can be visualized non-invasively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when viewing T-2-weighted images. EPVS are most commonly observed in the regions of the basal ganglia and the centrum semiovale; however, they have also been identified in the frontal cortex and hippocampal regions. EPVS are known to be increased in aging and hypertension, and are considered to be a biomarker of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Interest in EPVS has been significantly increased because these PVS are now considered to be an essential conduit necessary for the glymphatic pathway to provide the necessary efflux of metabolic waste. Metabolic waste includes misfolded proteins of amyloid beta and tau that are known to accumulate in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) within the interstitial fluid that is delivered to the subarachnoid space and eventually the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The CSF acts as a sink for accumulating neurotoxicities and allows clinical screening to potentially detect if LOAD may be developing early on in its clinical progression via spinal fluid examination. EPVS are thought to occur by obstruction of the PVS that associates with excessive neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular stiffening that impairs flow due to a dampening of the arterial and arteriolar pulsatility that aids in the convective flow of the metabolic debris within the glymphatic effluxing system. Additionally, increased EPVS has also been associated with Parkinson's disease and non-age-related multiple sclerosis (MS).",2023,CADISIL; brain MRI; capillary rarefaction; cerebral small vessel disease; enlarged perivascular spaces; glymphatic system; impaired cognition; lacunes; neurodegeneration; white matter hyperintensities,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Aging; Basal Ganglia; Arteries,"Shulyatnikova, T; Hayden, MR"

CSF Biomarkers in the Early Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a rapidly growing disease that affects millions of people worldwide, therefore there is an urgent need for its early diagnosis and treatment. A huge amount of research studies are performed on possible accurate and reliable diagnostic biomarkers of AD. Due to its direct contact with extracellular space of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the most useful biological fluid reflecting molecular events in the brain. Proteins and molecules that reflect the pathogenesis of the disease, e.g., neurodegeneration, accumulation of Abeta, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and apoptosis may be used as biomarkers. The aim of the current manuscript is to present the most commonly used CSF biomarkers for AD as well as novel biomarkers. Three CSF biomarkers, namely total tau, phospho-tau and Abeta42, are believed to have the highest diagnostic accuracy for early AD diagnosis and the ability to predict AD development in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Moreover, other biomarkers such as soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP), apoptotic proteins, secretases and inflammatory and oxidation markers are believed to have increased future prospects.",2023,Abeta; Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Brain; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Papaliagkas, V; Kalinderi, K; Vareltzis, P; Moraitou, D; Papamitsou, T; Chatzidimitriou, M"
TREM2 Expression and Amyloid-Beta Phagocytosis in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of dementia; its key pathological findings include the deposition of extracellular-neurotoxic-plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Ab). AD-pathogenesis involves mechanisms that operate outside the brain, and new researches indicate that peripheral inflammation is an early event in the disease. Herein, we focus on a receptor known as triggering-receptor-expressed-on-myeloid-cells2 (TREM2), which promotes the optimal immune cells function required to attenuate AD-progression and is, therefore, a potential target as peripheral diagnostic and prognostic-biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease. The objective of this exploratory study was to analyze: (1) soluble-TREM2 (sTREM2) plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentration, (2) TREM2-mRNA, (3) the percentage of TREM2-expressing monocytes, and (4) the concentration of miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p suspected to influence TREM2 transcription.

Fluorescent Sensing Platforms for Detecting and Imaging the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease with clinical symptoms of memory loss and cognitive impairment. Currently, no effective drug or therapeutic method is available for curing this disease. The major strategy used is to identify and block AD at its initial stage. Thus, early diagnosis is very important for intervention of the disease and assessment of drug efficacy. The gold standards of clinical diagnosis include the measurement of AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography imaging of the brain for amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits. However, these methods are difficult to apply to the general screening of a large aging population because of their high cost, radioactivity and inaccessibility. Comparatively, blood sample detection is less invasive and more accessible for the diagnosis of AD. Hence, a variety of assays based on fluorescence analysis, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, electrochemistry, etc., were developed for the detection of AD biomarkers in blood. These methods play significant roles in recognizing asymptomatic AD and predicting the course of the disease. In a clinical setting, the combination of blood biomarker detection with brain imaging may enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis. Fluorescence-sensing techniques can be used not only to detect the levels of biomarkers in blood but also to image biomarkers in the brain in real time due to their low toxicity, high sensitivity and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize the newly developed fluorescent sensing platforms and their application in detecting and imaging biomarkers of AD, such as Aβ and tau in the last five years, and discuss their prospects for clinical applications.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; diagnosis,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Biomarkers; tau Proteins,"Liu, X; Liu, Y; Liu, Q"

Genetic architecture of plasma Alzheimer disease biomarkers.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarker levels have identified novel genes implicated in disease risk, onset and progression. However, lumbar punctures have limited availability and may be perceived as invasive. Blood collection is readily available and well accepted, but it is not clear whether plasma biomarkers will be informative for genetic studies. Here we perform genetic analyses on concentrations of plasma amyloid-β peptides Aβ40 (n = 1,467) and Aβ42 (n = 1,484), Aβ42/40 (n = 1467) total tau (n = 504), tau phosphorylated (p-tau181; n = 1079) and neurofilament light (NfL; n = 2,058). GWAS and gene-based analysis was used to identify single variant and genes associated with plasma levels. Finally, polygenic risk score and summary statistics were used to investigate overlapping genetic architecture between plasma biomarkers, CSF biomarkers and AD risk. We found a total of six genome-wide significant signals. APOE was associated with plasma Aβ42, Aβ42/40, tau, p-tau181 and NfL. We proposed 10 candidate functional genes on the basis of 12 single nucleotide polymorphism-biomarker pairs and brain differential gene expression analysis. We found a significant genetic overlap between CSF and plasma biomarkers. We also demonstrate that it is possible to improve the specificity and sensitivity of these biomarkers, when genetic variants regulating protein levels are included in the model. This current study using plasma biomarker levels as quantitative traits can be critical to identification of novel genes that impact AD and more accurate interpretation of plasma biomarker levels.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Bradley, J; Gorijala, P; Schindler, SE; Sung, YJ; Ances, B; Fernandez, MV; Cruchaga, C"

Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice and trials.,"Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials. Longitudinal measurements of such biomarkers will also improve the detection of relevant disease-modifying effects of new drugs or lifestyle interventions.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers","Hansson, O; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Dage, J"

Impact of sex on neuroimmune contributions to Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation has been observed in both the idiopathic and familial forms of PD. Importantly, PD is reported more often in men than in women, men having at least 1.5- fold higher risk to develop PD than women. This review summarizes the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the neuroimmune contributions to PD and its investigation in animal models of PD. Innate and peripheral immune systems participate in the brain neuroinflammation of PD patients and is reproduced in neurotoxin, genetic and α-synuclein based models of PD. Microglia and astrocytes are the main cells of the innate immune system in the central nervous system and are the first to react to restore homeostasis in the brain. Analysis of serum immunoprofiles in female and male control and PD patients show that a great proportion of these markers differ between males and females. The relationship between cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory markers and PD clinical characteristics or PD biomarkers shows sex differences. Conversely, in animal models of PD, sex differences in inflammation are well documented and the beneficial effects of endogenous and exogenous estrogenic modulation in inflammation have been reported. Targeting neuroinflammation in PD is an emerging therapeutic option but gonadal drugs have not yet been investigated in this respect, thus offering new opportunities for sex specific treatments.",2023,Astrocyte; Glia; Inflammation; Microglia; Parkinson; Sex,Animals; Female; Male; Parkinson Disease; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; alpha-Synuclein; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain; Inflammation; Microglia,"Bourque, M; Morissette, M; Soulet, D; Di Paolo, T"
Changes in Plasma Neutral and Ether-Linked Lipids Are Associated with The Pathology and Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Aberrant lipid metabolism has been strongly linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the role of lipids in the pathophysiological processes of AD and their clinical progression is unclear. We hypothesized that plasma lipids are associated with the pathological hallmarks of AD, progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, and the rate of cognitive decline in MCI patients. To evaluate our hypotheses, we analysed the plasma lipidome profile by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in an LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS platform for 213 subjects recruited consecutively: 104 AD, 89 MCI, and 20 control subjects. Forty-seven (52.8%) MCI patients progressed to AD during follow-up (58 ± 12.5 months). We found that higher plasma levels of sphingomyelin SM(36:0) and diglyceride DG(44:3) were associated with an increased risk of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) positivity in CSF, while levels of SM(40:1) were associated with a reduced risk. Higher plasma levels of ether-linked triglyceride TG(O-60:10) were negatively associated with pathological levels of phosphorylated tau in CSF. Plasma levels of fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid FAHFA(34:0) and ether-linked phosphatidylcholine PC(O-36:1) were positively associated with pathological levels of total tau in CSF. Regarding the plasma lipids most associated with progression from MCI to AD, our analysis detected phosphatidyl-ethanolamine plasmalogen PE(P-36:4), TG(59:12), TG(46:0), and TG(O-62:7). Furthermore, TG(O-62:7) was the lipid that was most strongly associated with the rate of progression. In conclusion, our results indicate that neutral and ether-linked lipids are involved in the pathophysiological processes of AD and the progression from MCI to AD dementia, suggesting the involvement of lipid-mediated antioxidant mechanisms in AD.",2023,,,"Dakterzada, F; Jové, M; Huerto, R; Carnes, A; Sol, J; Pamplona, R; Piñol-Ripoll, G"

Inhibition of discoidin domain receptor (DDR)-1 with nilotinib alters CSF miRNAs and is associated with reduced inflammation and vascular fibrosis in Alzheimer's disease.,"Discoidin Domain Receptor (DDR)-1 is activated by collagen. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA-approved for leukemia and potently inhibits DDR-1. Individuals diagnosed with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated with nilotinib (versus placebo) for 12 months showed reduction of amyloid plaque and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid, and attenuation of hippocampal volume loss. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we explored unbiased next generation whole genome miRNA sequencing from AD patients CSF and miRNAs were matched with their corresponding mRNAs using gene ontology. Changes in CSF miRNAs were confirmed via measurement of CSF DDR1 activity and plasma levels of AD biomarkers. Approximately 1050 miRNAs are detected in the CSF but only 17 miRNAs are specifically altered between baseline and 12-month treatment with nilotinib versus placebo. Treatment with nilotinib significantly reduces collagen and DDR1 gene expression (upregulated in AD brain), in association with inhibition of CSF DDR1. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins and chemokines are reduced along with caspase-3 gene expression. Specific genes that indicate vascular fibrosis, e.g., collagen, Transforming Growth Factors (TGFs) and Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteases (TIMPs) are altered by DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib. Specific changes in vesicular transport, including the neurotransmitters dopamine and acetylcholine, and autophagy genes, including ATGs, indicate facilitation of autophagic flux and cellular trafficking. Inhibition of DDR1 with nilotinib may be a safe and effective adjunct treatment strategy involving an oral drug that enters the CNS and adequately engages its target. DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib exhibits multi-modal effects not only on amyloid and tau clearance but also on anti-inflammatory markers that may reduce cerebrovascular fibrosis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Chemokines; Collagen; Cytokines; Discoidin domain receptor 1; MicroRNAs; Nilotinib,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; MicroRNAs; Discoidin Domain Receptors; Pyrimidines; Collagen; Fibrosis; Inflammation,"Stevenson, M; Varghese, R; Hebron, ML; Liu, X; Ratliff, N; Smith, A; Turner, RS; Moussa, C"
Déjà vécu with recollective confabulation: an unusual presentation of Alzheimer's disease.,"A man in his 80s presented with gradual onset of a persistent and delusion-like perception that novel encounters are repetitions of previous experiences. Within 2 years of symptom onset, he had impaired verbal memory and executive dysfunction on neuropsychological assessment. Cerebrospinal fluid core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers analysis supported probable AD. Generalised and left temporal atrophy was seen on MRI of the brain. Neurological fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed left temporal and bilateral frontal lobe hypometabolism. His presenting symptom is known as déjà vécu with recollective confabulation, a rare phenomenon associated with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. While several potential mechanisms have been previously proposed, the fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT hypometabolism in the temporal and frontal lobes in this case suggests dual deficits in recognition memory and metacognition may be culprit mechanisms. Although uncommon, déjà vécu with recollective confabulation is a fascinating phenomenon that can provide a unique insight into memory and delusional processes in dementia.",2023,"Dementia, Alzheimer's type; Memory Disorders","Male; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Memory; Memory Disorders; Brain; Neuropsychological Tests; Positron-Emission Tomography","Zhang, X; Breen, N; Parratt, K"

Metals in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The role of metals in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still debated. Although previous research has linked changes in essential metal homeostasis and exposure to environmental heavy metals to the pathogenesis of AD, more research is needed to determine the relationship between metals and AD. In this review, we included human studies that (1) compared the metal concentrations between AD patients and healthy controls, (2) correlated concentrations of AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers with metal concentrations, and (3) used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the potential metal contributions to AD risk. Although many studies have examined various metals in dementia patients, understanding the dynamics of metals in these patients remains difficult due to considerable inconsistencies among the results of individual studies. The most consistent findings were for Zn and Cu, with most studies observing a decrease in Zn levels and an increase in Cu levels in AD patients. However, several studies found no such relation. Because few studies have compared metal levels with biomarker levels in the CSF of AD patients, more research of this type is required. Given that MR is revolutionizing epidemiologic research, additional MR studies that include participants from diverse ethnic backgrounds to assess the causal relationship between metals and AD risk are critical.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Mendelian randomization; biomarker; essential metals; heavy metals,,"Babić Leko, M; Langer Horvat, L; Španić Popovački, E; Zubčić, K; Hof, PR; Šimić, G"
The Effect of the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter Inhibitor on Cognition and Metabolic Parameters in a Rat Model of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD), and antidiabetic drugs, including the sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLTI), are being studied as possible sAD therapy. We have explored whether the SGLTI phloridzin may influence metabolic and cognitive parameters in a rat model of sAD. Adult male Wistar rats were randomized to a control (CTR), an sAD-model group induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ-icv; 3 mg/kg), a CTR+SGLTI, or an STZ-icv+SGLTI group. Two-month-long oral (gavage) SGLTI treatment (10 mg/kg) was initiated 1 month after STZ-icv and cognitive performance tested prior to sacrifice. SGLTI treatment significantly decreased plasma glucose levels only in the CTR group and failed to correct STZ-icv-induced cognitive deficit. In both the CTR and STZ-icv groups, SGLTI treatment diminished weight gain, decreased amyloid beta (Aβ) 1-42 in duodenum, and decreased the plasma levels of total glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), while the levels of active GLP-1, as well as both total and active glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, remained unchanged, compared to their respective controls. The increment in GLP-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and its effect on Aβ 1-42 in duodenum could be one of the molecular mechanisms by which SGLTIs indirectly induce pleiotropic beneficial effects.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; glucagon-like peptide 1; sodium–glucose cotransporter inhibitor; streptozotocin,,"Osmanović Barilar, J; Babić Perhoč, A; Knezović, A; Homolak, J; Virag, D; Šalković-Petrišić, M"

The cross-sectional association between amyloid burden and white matter hyperintensities in older adults without cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins into plaques. Individuals with AD frequently show mixed pathologies, often caused by cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), resulting in lesions such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH). The current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the cross-sectional relationship between amyloid burden and WMH in older adults without objective cognitive impairment. A systematic search performed in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO yielded 13 eligible studies. Aβ was assessed using PET, CSF, or plasma measurements. Two meta-analyses were performed: one on Cohen's d metrics and one on correlation coefficients. The meta-analyses revealed an overall weighted small-to-medium Cohen's d of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.31-0.78) in CSF, an overall correlation of 0.31 (0.09-0.50) in CSF, and a large Cohen's d of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.66-1.27) in PET. Only two studies assessed this relationship in plasma, with an effect size of - 0.20 (95% CI: -0.75 to 0.34).

"Assessing adipokines as potential biomarkers of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Midlife obesity and late-life weight loss confer a greater risk for developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon are currently unknown. The answer could lie on the involvement of gastrointestinal factors, such as adipokines (e.g., leptin, adiponectin, and resistin) and ghrelin. In this context, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 cross-sectional and 13 longitudinal studies targeting the associations between leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin and the prevalence of general dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We also examined the relationship between the four gastrointestinal factors and neurocognitive outcomes and AD-related cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Patients with AD had lower blood leptin and higher resistin levels than cognitively normal participants. Lower leptin and higher resistin were associated with higher degree of cognitive impairment. Additionally, lower late-life leptin levels might be associated with higher prospective risk of dementia and AD, although more studies are needed to corroborate this. Results in ghrelin and adiponectin were not conclusive, with age, sex distribution, obesity, and severity of dementia seemingly acting as moderators across several analyses.

Senolytic therapy to modulate the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (SToMP-AD) - Outcomes from the first clinical trial of senolytic therapy for Alzheimer's disease.,"Cellular senescence has been identified as a pathological mechanism linked to tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clearance of senescent cells using the senolytic compounds dasatinib (D) and quercetin (Q) reduced neuropathological burden and improved clinically relevant outcomes in the mice. Herein, we conducted a vanguard open-label clinical trial of senolytic therapy for AD with the primary aim of evaluating central nervous system (CNS) penetrance, as well as exploratory data collection relevant to safety, feasibility, and efficacy. Participants with early-stage symptomatic AD were enrolled in an open-label, 12-week pilot study of intermittent orally-delivered D+Q. CNS penetrance was assessed by evaluating drug levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Safety was continuously monitored with adverse event reporting, vitals, and laboratory work. Cognition, neuroimaging, and plasma and CSF biomarkers were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. Five participants (mean age: 76±5 years; 40% female) completed the trial. The treatment increased D and Q levels in the blood of all participants ranging from 12.7 to 73.5 ng/ml for D and 3.29-26.30 ng/ml for Q. D levels were detected in the CSF of four participants ranging from 0.281 to 0.536 ng/ml (t(4)=3.123, p=0.035); Q was not detected. Treatment was well-tolerated with no early discontinuation and six mild to moderate adverse events occurring across the study. Cognitive and neuroimaging endpoints did not significantly differ from baseline to post-treatment. CNS levels of IL-6 and GFAP increased from baseline to post-treatment (t(4)=3.913, p=008 and t(4)=3.354, p=0.028, respectively) concomitant with decreased levels of several cytokines and chemokines associated with senescence, and a trend toward higher levels of Aβ42 (t(4)=-2.338, p=0.079). Collectively the data indicate the CNS penetrance of D and provide preliminary support for the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of the intervention and suggest that astrocytes and Aβ may be particularly responsive to the treatment.

Too much information? Asian Americans' preferences for incidental brain MRI findings.,"South Asian (SA) and East Asian (EA) older adults represent the fastest growing group of Americans at risk for dementia, but their participation in aging and dementia research has been limited. While recruiting healthy SA older adults into a brain health study, we encountered unexpected hesitancy towards structural brain MRI analysis along with some stigmatizing attitudes related to internal locus of control (LoC) for future dementia risks. We hypothesized that support for MRI-related research was influenced by these attitudes as well as one's own MRI experience, perceived MRI safety, and concerns for one's own risks for future dementia/stroke.",2023,Asian; East Asian; MRI; South Asian; aged; clinical neurology; cognition; dementia; disclosure / ethics; immigrants; incidental findings; informed consent / ethics; neuroimaging; race/ethnicity; surveys and questionnaires,,"Kota, K; Dawson, A; Papas, J; Sotelo, V; Su, G; Li, ML; Lee, W; Estervil, J; Marquez, M; Sarkar, S; Lopez, LL; Hu, WT"
Chimeric Antigen Receptor Macrophages Target and Resorb Amyloid Plaques in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Substantial evidence suggests a role for immunotherapy in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several monoclonal antibodies targeting aggregated forms of beta amyloid (Aβ), have been shown to reduce amyloid plaques and in some cases, mitigate cognitive decline in early-stage AD patients. We sought to determine if genetically engineered macrophages could improve the targeting and degradation of amyloid plaques. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophages (CAR-Ms), which show promise as a cancer treatment, are an appealing strategy to enhance target recognition and phagocytosis of amyloid plaques in AD. We genetically engineered macrophages to express a CAR containing the anti-amyloid antibody aducanumab as the external domain and the Fc receptor signaling domain internally.

Quantitative Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid Protein Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid (Aβ), total Tau, and phosphorylated Tau (pTau) providing the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for diagnosis. However, these diagnostic biomarkers do not reflect the complex changes in AD brain beyond amyloid (A) and Tau (T) pathologies. Here, we report a selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) method with isotopically labeled standards for relative protein quantification in CSF. Biomarker positive (AT+) and negative (AT-) CSF pools were used as quality controls (QCs) to assess assay precision. We detected 62 peptides (51 proteins) with an average coefficient of variation (CV) of ~13% across 30 QCs and 133 controls (cognitively normal, AT-), 127 asymptomatic (cognitively normal, AT+) and 130 symptomatic AD (cognitively impaired, AT+). Proteins that could distinguish AT+ from AT- individuals included SMOC1, GDA, 14-3-3 proteins, and those involved in glycolysis. Proteins that could distinguish cognitive impairment were mainly neuronal proteins (VGF, NPTX2, NPTXR, and SCG2).

However, it is unclear whether the nature and extent of neuroinflammatory responses in LBD are comparable to those in AD.

Eigenvector centrality dynamics are related to Alzheimer's disease pathological changes in non-demented individuals.,"Amyloid-β accumulation starts in highly connected brain regions and is associated with functional connectivity alterations in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This regional vulnerability is related to the high neuronal activity and strong fluctuations typical of these regions. Recently, dynamic functional connectivity was introduced to investigate changes in functional network organization over time. High dynamic functional connectivity variations indicate increased regional flexibility to participate in multiple subnetworks, promoting functional integration. Currently, only a limited number of studies have explored the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity in the pre-dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. We study the associations between abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and both static and dynamic properties of functional hubs, using eigenvector centrality, and their relationship with cognitive performance, in 701 non-demented participants from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia cohort. Voxel-wise eigenvector centrality was computed for the whole functional magnetic resonance imaging time series (static), and within a sliding window (dynamic). Differences in static eigenvector centrality between amyloid positive (A+) and negative (A-) participants and amyloid-tau groups were found in a general linear model. Dynamic eigenvector centrality standard deviation and range were compared between groups within clusters of significant static eigenvector centrality differences, and within 10 canonical resting-state networks. The effect of the interaction between amyloid status and cognitive performance on dynamic eigenvector centrality variability was also evaluated with linear models. Models were corrected for age, sex, and education level. Lower static centrality was found in A+ participants in posterior brain areas including a parietal and an occipital cluster; higher static centrality was found in a medio-frontal cluster. Lower eigenvector centrality variability (standard deviation) occurred in A+ participants in the frontal cluster. The default mode network and the dorsal visual networks of A+ participants had lower dynamic eigenvector centrality variability. Centrality variability in the default mode network and dorsal visual networks were associated with cognitive performance in the A- and A+ groups, with lower variability being observed in A+ participants with good cognitive scores. Our results support the role and timing of eigenvector centrality alterations in very early stages of Alzheimer's disease and show that centrality variability over time adds relevant information on the dynamic patterns that cause static eigenvector centrality alterations. We propose that dynamic eigenvector centrality is an early biomarker of the interplay between early Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline.",2023,amyloid; eigenvector centrality; functional connectivity; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease,,"Lorenzini, L; Ingala, S; Collij, LE; Wottschel, V; Haller, S; Blennow, K; Frisoni, G; Chételat, G; Payoux, P; Lage-Martinez, P; Ewers, M; Waldman, A; Wardlaw, J; Ritchie, C; Gispert, JD; Mutsaerts, HJMM; Visser, PJ; Scheltens, P; Tijms, B; Barkhof, F; Wink, AM"

"Current Understanding of the Anatomy, Physiology, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Neurofluids: Update From the 2022 ""ISMRM Imaging Neurofluids Study group"" Workshop in Rome.","Neurofluids is a term introduced to define all fluids in the brain and spine such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and interstitial fluid. Neuroscientists in the past millennium have steadily identified the several different fluid environments in the brain and spine that interact in a synchronized harmonious manner to assure a healthy microenvironment required for optimal neuroglial function. Neuroanatomists and biochemists have provided an incredible wealth of evidence revealing the anatomy of perivascular spaces, meninges and glia and their role in drainage of neuronal waste products. Human studies have been limited due to the restricted availability of noninvasive imaging modalities that can provide a high spatiotemporal depiction of the brain neurofluids. Therefore, animal studies have been key in advancing our knowledge of the temporal and spatial dynamics of fluids, for example, by injecting tracers with different molecular weights. Such studies have sparked interest to identify possible disruptions to neurofluids dynamics in human diseases such as small vessel disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and dementia. However, key differences between rodent and human physiology should be considered when extrapolating these findings to understand the human brain. An increasing armamentarium of noninvasive MRI techniques is being built to identify markers of altered drainage pathways. During the three-day workshop organized by the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine that was held in Rome in September 2022, several of these concepts were discussed by a distinguished international faculty to lay the basis of what is known and where we still lack evidence. We envision that in the next decade, MRI will allow imaging of the physiology of neurofluid dynamics and drainage pathways in the human brain to identify true pathological processes underlying disease and to discover new avenues for early diagnoses and treatments including drug delivery.

Elevated CSF angiopoietin-2 correlates with blood-brain barrier leakiness and markers of neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Breakdown of the neurovascular unit in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to leakiness of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), contributing to cognitive decline and disease pathology. Vascular stability depends on angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) signalling, antagonised by angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) upon endothelial injury. We have examined the relationship between CSF ANGPT2 and CSF markers of BBB leakiness and disease pathology, across three independent cohorts: (i) 31 AD patients and 33 healthy controls grouped according to their biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and Aβ42 < 550 pg/mL); (ii) 121 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research study (84 participants cognitively unimpaired (CU) enriched for a parental history of AD, 19 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 21 with AD); (iii) a neurologically normal cohort aged 23-78 years with paired CSF and serum samples. CSF ANGPT2 level was measured by sandwich ELISA. In cohort (i), CSF ANGPT2 was elevated in AD, correlating with CSF t-tau and p-tau181 but not Aβ42. ANGPT2 also correlated positively with CSF sPDGFRβ and fibrinogen - markers of pericyte injury and BBB leakiness. In cohort (ii), CSF ANGPT2 was highest in MCI. CSF ANGT2 correlated with CSF albumin in the CU and MCI cohorts but not in AD. ANGPT2 also correlated with t-tau and p-tau and with markers of neuronal injury (neurogranin and α-synuclein) and neuroinflammation (GFAP and YKL-40). In cohort (iii), CSF ANGPT2 correlated strongly with the CSF:serum albumin ratio. Increased CSF ANGPT2 and the CSF:serum albumin ratio showed non-significant associations with elevated serum ANGPT2 in this small cohort. Together, these data indicate that CSF ANGPT2 is associated with BBB leakiness in early AD and is closely related to tau pathology and neuronal injury.

High affinity of β-amyloid proteins to cerebral capillaries: implications in chronic lead exposure-induced neurotoxicity in rats.,"Lead (Pb) is a known environmental risk factor in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The existing reports suggest that Pb exposure increases beta-amyloid (Aβ) levels in brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and facilitates the formation of amyloid plaques, which is a pathological hallmark for AD. Pb exposure has long been associated with cerebral vasculature injury. Yet it remained unclear if Pb exposure caused excessive Ab buildup in cerebral vasculature, which may damage the blood-brain barrier and cause abnormal Ab accumulation. This study was designed to investigate the impact of chronic Pb exposure on Aβ accumulation in cerebral capillary and the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor protein-1 (LRP1), a critical Aβ transporter, in brain capillary and parenchyma. Sprague-Dawley rats received daily oral gavage at doses of 0, 14 (low-dose), and 27 (high-dose) mg Pb/kg as Pb acetate, 5 d/wk, for 4 or 8 wks.

Protective Alzheimer's disease-associated APP A673T variant predominantly decreases sAPPβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid and 2D/3D cell culture models.,"The rare A673T variant was the first variant found within the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene conferring protection against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thereafter, different studies have discovered that the carriers of the APP A673T variant show reduced levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the plasma and better cognitive performance at high age. Here, we analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of APP A673T carriers and control individuals using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify differentially regulated targets in an unbiased manner. Furthermore, the APP A673T variant was introduced into 2D and 3D neuronal cell culture models together with the pathogenic APP Swedish and London mutations. Consequently, we now report for the first time the protective effects of the APP A673T variant against AD-related alterations in the CSF, plasma, and brain biopsy samples from the frontal cortex. The CSF levels of soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) and Aβ42 were significantly decreased on average 9-26% among three APP A673T carriers as compared to three well-matched controls not carrying the protective variant. Consistent with these CSF findings, immunohistochemical assessment of cortical biopsy samples from the same APP A673T carriers did not reveal Aβ, phospho-tau, or p62 pathologies. We identified differentially regulated targets involved in protein phosphorylation, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in the CSF and plasma samples of APP A673T carriers. Some of the identified targets showed inverse levels in AD brain tissue with respect to increased AD-associated neurofibrillary pathology. In 2D and 3D neuronal cell culture models expressing APP with the Swedish and London mutations, the introduction of the APP A673T variant resulted in lower sAPPβ levels. Concomitantly, the levels of sAPPα were increased, while decreased levels of CTFβ and Aβ42 were detected in some of these models. Our findings emphasize the important role of APP-derived peptides in the pathogenesis of AD and demonstrate the effectiveness of the protective APP A673T variant to shift APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway in vitro even in the presence of two pathogenic mutations.",2023,2D/3D cell models; APP A673T variant; Alzheimer's disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Protective mechanisms,Humans; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Heterozygote; Brain,"Wittrahm, R; Takalo, M; Kuulasmaa, T; Mäkinen, PM; Mäkinen, P; Končarević, S; Fartzdinov, V; Selzer, S; Kokkola, T; Antikainen, L; Martiskainen, H; Kemppainen, S; Marttinen, M; Jeskanen, H; Rostalski, H; Rahunen, E; Kivipelto, M; Ngandu, T; Natunen, T; Lambert, JC; Tanzi, RE; Kim, DY; Rauramaa, T; Herukka, SK; Soininen, H; Laakso, M; Pike, I; Leinonen, V; Haapasalo, A; Hiltunen, M"

CSF tau phosphorylation occupancies at T217 and T205 represent improved biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)42/Aβ40 and the concentration of tau phosphorylated at site 181 (p-tau181) are well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study used mass spectrometry to measure concentrations of nine phosphorylated and five nonphosphorylated tau species and phosphorylation occupancies (percentage phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated) at ten sites. In the present study we show that, in 750 individuals with a median age of 71.2 years, CSF pT217/T217 predicted the presence of brain amyloid by positron emission tomography (PET) slightly better than Aβ42/Aβ40 (P = 0.02). Furthermore, for individuals with positive brain amyloid by PET (n = 263), CSF pT217/T217 was more strongly correlated with the amount of amyloid (Spearman's ρ = 0.69) than Aβ42/Aβ40 (ρ = -0.42, P < 0.0001). In two independent cohorts of participants with symptoms of AD dementia (n = 55 and n = 90), CSF pT217/T217 and pT205/T205 were better correlated with tau PET measures than CSF p-tau181 concentration.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Metabolomics: Pilot Study of Using Metabolomics to Assess Diet and Metabolic Interventions in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Brain glucose hypometabolism is an early sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and interventions which offset this deficit, such as ketogenic diets, show promise as AD therapeutics. Conversely, high-fat feeding may exacerbate AD risk. We analyzed the metabolomic profile of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a pilot study of older adults who underwent saline and triglyceride (TG) infusions. Older adults (12 cognitively normal (CN), age 65.3 ± 8.1, and 9 with cognitive impairment (CI), age 70.9 ± 8.6) underwent a 5 h TG or saline infusion on different days using a random crossover design; CSF was collected at the end of infusion. Aqueous metabolites were measured using a targeted mass spectroscopy (MS) platform focusing on 215 metabolites from over 35 different metabolic pathways. Data were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 and SAS. Of the 215 targeted metabolites, 99 were detectable in CSF. Only one metabolite significantly differed by treatment: the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (HBA). Post hoc analyses showed that HBA levels were associated with age and markers of metabolic syndrome and demonstrated different correlation patterns for the two treatments.

Inflammatory Response and Exosome Biogenesis of Choroid Plexus Organoids Derived from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.,"The choroid plexus (ChP) is a complex structure in the human brain that is responsible for the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and forming the blood-CSF barrier (B-CSF-B). Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have shown promising results in the formation of brain organoids in vitro; however, very few studies to date have generated ChP organoids. In particular, no study has assessed the inflammatory response and the extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis of hiPSC-derived ChP organoids. In this study, the impacts of Wnt signaling on the inflammatory response and EV biogenesis of ChP organoids derived from hiPSCs was investigated. During days 10-15, bone morphogenetic protein 4 was added along with (+/-) CHIR99021 (CHIR, a small molecule GSK-3β inhibitor that acts as a Wnt agonist). At day 30, the ChP organoids were characterized by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry for TTR (~72%) and CLIC6 (~20%) expression. Compared to the -CHIR group, the +CHIR group showed an upregulation of 6 out of 10 tested ChP genes, including ",2023,Wnt signaling; choroid plexus organoids; extracellular vesicles; human pluripotent stem cells; inflammatory response,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Choroid Plexus; Exosomes; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Organoids,"Muok, L; Liu, C; Chen, X; Esmonde, C; Arthur, P; Wang, X; Singh, M; Driscoll, T; Li, Y"

Tau in cerebrospinal fluid induces neuronal hyperexcitability and alters hippocampal theta oscillations.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies are characterized by the aggregation of tau into soluble and insoluble forms (including tangles and neuropil threads). In humans, a fraction of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated N-terminal to mid-domain tau species, are secreted into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some of these CSF tau species can be measured as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, starting from early stages of disease. While in animal models of AD pathology, soluble tau aggregates have been shown to disrupt neuronal function, it is unclear whether the tau species present in CSF will modulate neural activity. Here, we have developed and applied a novel approach to examine the electrophysiological effects of CSF from patients with a tau-positive biomarker profile. The method involves incubation of acutely-isolated wild-type mouse hippocampal brain slices with small volumes of diluted human CSF, followed by a suite of electrophysiological recording methods to evaluate their effects on neuronal function, from single cells through to the network level. Comparison of the toxicity profiles of the same CSF samples, with and without immuno-depletion for tau, has enabled a pioneering demonstration that CSF-tau potently modulates neuronal function. We demonstrate that CSF-tau mediates an increase in neuronal excitability in single cells. We then observed, at the network level, increased input-output responses and enhanced paired-pulse facilitation as well as an increase in long-term potentiation. Finally, we show that CSF-tau modifies the generation and maintenance of hippocampal theta oscillations, which have important roles in learning and memory and are known to be altered in AD patients. Together, we describe a novel method for screening human CSF-tau to understand functional effects on neuron and network activity, which could have far-reaching benefits in understanding tau pathology, thus allowing for the development of better targeted treatments for tauopathies in the future.",2023,Cerebrospinal fluid; Electrophysiology; Tau; Tauopathy; Theta oscillations,Humans; Mice; Animals; tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Tauopathies; Brain; Biomarkers; Hippocampus; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Peptide Fragments,"Brown, J; Camporesi, E; Lantero-Rodriguez, J; Olsson, M; Wang, A; Medem, B; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Karikari, TK; Wall, M; Hill, E"

CSF neurochemical profile and cognitive changes in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment.,"Pathophysiological substrate(s) and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) are still matter of debate. Baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurochemical profile and cognitive changes after 2 years were investigated in a retrospective series of PD-MCI (n = 48), cognitively normal PD (PD-CN, n = 40), prodromal Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD, n = 25) and cognitively healthy individuals with other neurological diseases (OND, n = 44). CSF biomarkers reflecting amyloidosis (Aβ42/40 ratio, sAPPα, sAPPβ), tauopathy (p-tau), neurodegeneration (t-tau, NfL, p-NfH), synaptic damage (α-syn, neurogranin) and glial activation (sTREM2, YKL-40) were measured. The great majority (88%) of PD-MCI patients was A-/T-/N-. Among all biomarkers considered, only NfL/p-NfH ratio was significantly higher in PD-MCI vs. PD-CN (p = 0.02). After 2 years, one-third of PD-MCI patients worsened; such worsening was associated with higher baseline levels of NfL, p-tau, and sTREM2.

hsa_circ_0006916 Exerts Effect on Amyloid Beta-Induced Neuron Injury by Targeting miR-217/HOMER1.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are rich in miRNA-binding sites, which serve as miRNA sponges or competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). In the central nervous system, circRNAs are relevant to many neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dementia associated with AD is correlated with the conversion of the β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptides from soluble monomers to aggregated oligomers and insoluble fibrils. Downregulation of circHOMER1 (circ_0006916) expression level is observed in AD female cases.

Degradation of EEG microstates patterns in subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment: Early biomarkers along the Alzheimer's Disease continuum?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological changes may begin up to decades earlier than the appearance of the first symptoms of cognitive decline. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) could be the first pre-clinical sign of possible AD, which might be followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the initial stage of clinical cognitive decline. However, the neural correlates of these prodromic stages are not completely clear yet. Recent studies suggest that EEG analysis tools characterizing the cortical activity as a whole, such as microstates and cortical regions connectivity, might support a characterization of SCD and MCI conditions. Here we test this approach by performing a broad set of analyses to identify the prominent EEG markers differentiating SCD (n = 57), MCI (n = 46) and healthy control subjects (HC, n = 19). We found that the salient differences were in the temporal structure of the microstates patterns, with MCI being associated with less complex sequences due to the altered transition probability, frequency and duration of canonic microstate C. Spectral content of EEG, network connectivity, and spatial arrangement of microstates were instead largely similar in the three groups. Interestingly, comparing properties of EEG microstates in different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers profiles, we found that canonic microstate C displayed significant differences in topography in AD-like profile. These results show that the progression of dementia might be associated with a degradation of the cortical organization captured by microstates analysis, and that this leads to altered transitions between cortical states. Overall, our approach paves the way for the use of non-invasive EEG recordings in the identification of possible biomarkers of progression to AD from its prodromal states.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; EEG; Microstates; Mild cognitive impairment; Subjective cognitive decline,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Electroencephalography,"Lassi, M; Fabbiani, C; Mazzeo, S; Burali, R; Vergani, AA; Giacomucci, G; Moschini, V; Morinelli, C; Emiliani, F; Scarpino, M; Bagnoli, S; Ingannato, A; Nacmias, B; Padiglioni, S; Micera, S; Sorbi, S; Grippo, A; Bessi, V; Mazzoni, A"
Review of Risk Factors Associated With Biomarkers for Alzheimer Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with no cure. The number of individuals living with AD doubles every 5 years. The current clinical practice relies on clinical history, mental status tests, cerebrum imaging, and physical and neurological examinations; however, recent advances in the field of biomarkers have provided clues for the early detection of AD. High levels of tau and low levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) in cerebrospinal fluid are well-known biomarkers for AD. METHODS: A database search of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL was conducted to identify relevant articles published within the last 5 years. The search was limited to articles concerning adults 65 years or older and published in the English language. Twelve articles were included in the review. RESULTS: Risk factors of sleep disruption, depression, and motor function are implicated. Cerebrospinal fluid parameters for biomarkers of tau and Aβ were universally lower among Blacks compared with Whites, raising concern that norm reference may not be accurate for all populations. Older adults are more at risk for AD. Results are inconclusive regarding whether depression is related to Aβ and tau pathology. CONCLUSION: Nurses should screen for sleep architecture, depression, and motor function in their patients and educate them on good sleep hygiene. Sleep studies should be advocated for people with suspected sleep apnea to mitigate the risk factor related to abnormal Aβ and tau pathology. Falls and decreased motor function require screening because they may be early indicators of abnormal biomarkers leading to AD.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Risk Factors,"Xiong, J; Bhimani, R; Carney-Anderson, L"
Osmotic Minipump Implantation for Increasing Glucose Concentration in Mouse Cerebrospinal Fluid.,"Diabetes increases the risk of cognitive decline and impairs brain function. Whether or not this relationship between high glucose and cognitive deficits is causal remains elusive. Moreover, whether these deficits are mediated by an increase in glucose levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or blood is also unclear. There are very few studies investigating the direct effects of high CSF glucose levels on central nervous system (CNS) function, especially on learning and memory, since current diabetes models are not sufficiently developed to address such research questions. This article describes a method to chronically increase CSF glucose levels for 4 weeks by continuously infusing glucose into the lateral ventricle using osmotic minipumps in mice. The protocol was validated by measuring glucose levels in CSF. This protocol increased CSF glucose levels to ~328 mg/dL after infusion of a 50% glucose solution at a 0.25 µL/h flow rate, compared to a CSF glucose concentration of ~56 mg/dL in mice that received artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Furthermore, this protocol did not affect blood glucose levels. Therefore, this method can be used to determine the direct effects of high CSF glucose on brain function or a specific neural pathway independently of changes in blood glucose levels. Overall, the approach described here will facilitate the development of animal models for testing the role of high CSF glucose in mediating features of Alzheimer's disease and/or other neurodegenerative disorders associated with diabetes.",2023,,Mice; Animals; Blood Glucose; Glucose; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cerebrospinal Fluid,"Raza, MU; Chhabra, KH"

Higher CSF/serum free-T4 ratio is associated with improvement of quality of life during treatment with L-thyroxine.,"Up to 20% of individuals with primary hypothyroidism treated with L-thyroxine still suffer from severe symptoms. These are supposedly brain derived and involve both cognitive and emotional domains. Previously, no consistent relationship has been found between thyroid hormones (TH) or TSH levels in blood and quality of life (QoL). Recently, we reported an association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum free-thyroxine (f-T4) ratio and QoL, in juvenile hypothyroid patients. Here, we investigated if CSF/serum f-T4 ratio and QoL estimates correlate also during L-thyroxine treatment. Moreover, the CSF biomarker neurogranin (Ng) was used as a biomarker for synaptic function and integrity in clinical research. Ng is partially controlled by TH and therefore we investigated the relationship between QoL parameters and Ng levels. Patients diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism were investigated using vital parameters, serum and CSF analyses of TH, TSH, Ng and QoL questionnaires. Similar procedures were performed after 6 months of treatment. The most marked associations with QoL were found for CSF/serum f-T4 ratio, which was strongly related to several QoL parameters such as the mental subscore of SF-36 (r = 0.83, p < .0005). Ng, which did not differ from that in our healthy controls, was lower in some patients during treatment and higher in others. However, the change in Ng during treatment was significantly correlated with QoL parameters including the mental subscore of SF-36 (r = -0.86, p < .0001). In addition, the CSF/serum f-T4 ratio correlated with the change in Ng (r = -0.75, p = .001). Our results suggest that the ratio between CSF and serum f-T4 is an important biomarker for QoL during treatment of patients with primary hypothyroidism, so far in research, but in the future maybe also in clinical settings. Moreover, this ratio also correlates with the changes in Ng levels during L-thyroxine treatment, further supporting the impact of the TH balance between serum and CSF on QoL.",2023,cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; cognition; neurogranin; primary hypothyroidism; quality of life,Humans; Thyroxine; Quality of Life; Triiodothyronine; Thyrotropin; Thyroid Hormones; Hypothyroidism; Biomarkers,"Funkquist, A; Wandt, B; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Svensson, J; Bjellerup, P; Freund-Levi, Y; Sjöberg, S"
Discovery of novel CSF biomarkers to predict progression in dementia using machine learning.,"Providing an accurate prognosis for individual dementia patients remains a challenge since they greatly differ in rates of cognitive decline. In this study, we used machine learning techniques with the aim to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that predict the rate of cognitive decline within dementia patients. First, longitudinal mini-mental state examination scores (MMSE) of 210 dementia patients were used to create fast and slow progression groups. Second, we trained random forest classifiers on CSF proteomic profiles and obtained a well-performing prediction model for the progression group (ROC-AUC = 0.82). As a third step, Shapley values and Gini feature importance measures were used to interpret the model performance and identify top biomarker candidates for predicting the rate of cognitive decline. Finally, we explored the potential for each of the 20 top candidates in internal sensitivity analyses. TNFRSF4 and TGF [Formula: see text]-1 emerged as the top markers, being lower in fast-progressing patients compared to slow-progressing patients. Proteins of which a low concentration was associated with fast progression were enriched for cell signalling and immune response pathways. None of our top markers stood out as strong individual predictors of subsequent cognitive decline. This could be explained by small effect sizes per protein and biological heterogeneity among dementia patients. Taken together, this study presents a novel progression biomarker identification framework and protein leads for personalised prediction of cognitive decline in dementia.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Proteomics; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Machine Learning; Disease Progression,"Gogishvili, D; Vromen, EM; Koppes-den Hertog, S; Lemstra, AW; Pijnenburg, YAL; Visser, PJ; Tijms, BM; Del Campo, M; Abeln, S; Teunissen, CE; Vermunt, L"

Meta-analysis of published cerebrospinal fluid proteomics data identifies and validates metabolic enzyme panel as Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"To develop therapies for Alzheimer's disease, we need accurate in vivo diagnostics. Multiple proteomic studies mapping biomarker candidates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resulted in little overlap. To overcome this shortcoming, we apply the rarely used concept of proteomics meta-analysis to identify an effective biomarker panel. We combine ten independent datasets for biomarker identification: seven datasets from 150 patients/controls for discovery, one dataset with 20 patients/controls for down-selection, and two datasets with 494 patients/controls for validation. The discovery results in 21 biomarker candidates and down-selection in three, to be validated in the two additional large-scale proteomics datasets with 228 diseased and 266 control samples. This resulting 3-protein biomarker panel differentiates Alzheimer's disease (AD) from controls in the two validation cohorts with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.83 and 0.87, respectively.

Apolipoprotein E O-glycosylation is associated with amyloid plaques and APOE genotype.,"Although the APOE ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), the relationship between apolipoprotein (apoE) and AD pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Relatively little is known about the apoE protein species, including post-translational modifications, that exist in the human periphery and CNS. To better understand these apoE species, we developed a LC-MS/MS assay that simultaneously quantifies both unmodified and O-glycosylated apoE peptides. The study cohort included 47 older individuals (age 75.6 ± 5.7 years [mean ± standard deviation]), including 23 individuals (49%) with cognitive impairment. Paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples underwent analysis. We quantified O-glycosylation of two apoE protein residues - one in the hinge region and one in the C-terminal region - and found that glycosylation occupancy of the hinge region in the plasma was significantly correlated with plasma total apoE levels, APOE genotype and amyloid status as determined by CSF Aβ42/Aβ40. A model with plasma glycosylation occupancy, plasma total apoE concentration, and APOE genotype distinguished amyloid status with an AUROC of 0.89. These results suggest that plasma apoE glycosylation levels could be a marker of brain amyloidosis, and that apoE glycosylation may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Apolipoprotein E; Glycosylation; Mass spectrometry; Proteomics,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E; Biomarkers; Chromatography, Liquid; Genotype; Glycosylation; Peptide Fragments; Plaque, Amyloid; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","Lawler, PE; Bollinger, JG; Schindler, SE; Hodge, CR; Iglesias, NJ; Krishnan, V; Coulton, JB; Li, Y; Holtzman, DM; Bateman, RJ"

Normal-Tension Glaucoma: A Glymphopathy?,"Glaucoma is one of the main causes of irreversible blindness in the world. The most common form, primary open-angle glaucoma, is an optic neuropathy that is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, leading to structural changes in the optic nerve head and associated visual field defects. Elevated intraocular pressure remains the most important modifiable risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma. However, a significant proportion of patients develop glaucomatous damage in the absence of increased intraocular pressure, a condition known as normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). The pathophysiology underlying NTG remains unclear. Several studies have revealed that vascular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) factors may play significant roles in the development of NTG. Vascular failure caused by functional or structural abnormalities, and compartmentation of the optic nerve subarachnoid space with disturbed CSF dynamics have been shown to be associated with NTG. In the present article, based on the concept of the glymphatic system and observations in patients with NTG, we hypothesize that failure of fluid transport via the glymphatic pathway in the optic nerve may be involved in the pathogenesis of some if not many cases of NTG. According to this hypothesis, vascular and CSF factors may share reduced glymphatic transport and perivascular waste clearance in the optic nerve as a final common pathway leading to the development of NTG. In addition, we speculate that some cases of NTG may reflect glymphatic dysfunction in natural brain aging and central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Clearly, further studies are needed to gain additional insight into the relative contribution of these factors and conditions to reduced glymphatic transport in the optic nerve.",2023,cerebrospinal fluid; glymphatic system; normal-tension glaucoma; optic nerve; perivascular spaces; vascular failure,,"Wostyn, P; Killer, HE"
Association of biological sex with clinical outcomes and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.,"The study of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease is increasingly recognized as a key priority in research and clinical development. People with Down syndrome represent the largest population with a genetic link to Alzheimer's disease (>90% in the 7th decade). Yet, sex differences in Alzheimer's disease manifestations have not been fully investigated in these individuals, who are key candidates for preventive clinical trials. In this double-centre, cross-sectional study of 628 adults with Down syndrome [46% female, 44.4 (34.6; 50.7) years], we compared Alzheimer's disease prevalence, as well as cognitive outcomes and AT(N) biomarkers across age and sex. Participants were recruited from a population-based health plan in Barcelona, Spain, and from a convenience sample recruited via services for people with intellectual disabilities in England and Scotland. They underwent assessment with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome, modified cued recall test and determinations of brain amyloidosis (CSF amyloid-β 42 / 40 and amyloid-PET), tau pathology (CSF and plasma phosphorylated-tau181) and neurodegeneration biomarkers (CSF and plasma neurofilament light, total-tau, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and MRI). We used within-group locally estimated scatterplot smoothing models to compare the trajectory of biomarker changes with age in females versus males, as well as by apolipoprotein ɛ4 carriership. Our work revealed similar prevalence, age at diagnosis and Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome scores by sex, but males showed lower modified cued recall test scores from age 45 compared with females. AT(N) biomarkers were comparable in males and females. When considering apolipoprotein ɛ4, female ɛ4 carriers showed a 3-year earlier age at diagnosis compared with female non-carriers (50.5 versus 53.2 years, ",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Down syndrome; gender; precision medicine; sex,,"Iulita, MF; Bejanin, A; Vilaplana, E; Carmona-Iragui, M; Benejam, B; Videla, L; Barroeta, I; Fernández, S; Altuna, M; Pegueroles, J; Montal, V; Valldeneu, S; Giménez, S; González-Ortiz, S; Torres, S; El Bounasri El Bennadi, S; Padilla, C; Rozalem Aranha, M; Estellés, T; Illán-Gala, I; Belbin, O; Valle-Tamayo, N; Camacho, V; Blessing, E; Osorio, RS; Videla, S; Lehmann, S; Holland, AJ; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Alcolea, D; Clarimón, J; Zaman, SH; Blesa, R; Lleó, A; Fortea, J"

Multifaceted Roles of Aquaporins in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The central nervous system is highly dependent on water, and disturbances in water homeostasis can have a significant impact on its normal functions. The regulation of water balance is, at least in part, carried out via specialized water channels called aquaporins. In the central nervous system, two major aquaporins (AQPs), AQP1 and AQP4, and their potential involvements have been long implicated in the pathophysiology of many brain disorders such as brain edema and Neuromyelitis optica. In addition to these diseases, there is growing attention to the involvement of AQPs in the removal of waste products in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This indicates that targeting fluid homeostasis is a novel and attractive approach for AD. This review article aims to summarize recent knowledge on the pathological implications of AQPs in AD, discussing unsolved questions and future prospects.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ; CSF; ISF; aquaporins; glymphatic system; tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Aquaporins; Central Nervous System; Brain Edema; Water,"Yamada, K"

Plasma neurodegeneration biomarker concentrations associate with glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic measures in neurological disorders.,"Clearance of neurotoxic brain proteins via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to blood has recently emerged to be crucial, and plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration were newly introduced to predict neurological disease. This study examines in 106 individuals with neurological disorders associations between plasma biomarkers [40 and 42 amino acid-long amyloid-β (Aβ40 and Aβ42), total-tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL)] and magnetic resonance imaging measures of CSF-mediated clearance from brain via extra-vascular pathways (proxy of glymphatic function) and CSF-to-blood clearance variables from pharmacokinetic modeling (proxy of meningeal lymphatic egress). We also examine how biomarkers vary during daytime and associate with subjective sleep quality. Plasma concentrations of neurodegeneration markers associate with indices of glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic functions in individual- and disease-specific manners, vary during daytime, but are unaffected by sleep quality. The results suggest that plasma concentrations of neurodegeneration biomarkers associate with measures of glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic function.",2023,,Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofilament Proteins,"Eide, PK; Lashkarivand, A; Pripp, A; Valnes, LM; Hovd, MH; Ringstad, G; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H"
Annualized changes in rate of amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration are greater in participants who become amyloid positive than those who remain amyloid negative.,"This study longitudinally examined participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who underwent a conversion in amyloid-beta (Aβ) status in comparison to a group of ADNI participants who did not show a change in amyloid status over the same follow-up period. Participants included 136 ADNI dementia-free participants with 2 florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Of these participants, 68 showed amyloid conversion as measured on florbetapir PET, and the other 68 did not. Amyloid converters and non-converters were chosen to have representative demographic data (age, education, sex, diagnostic status, and race).

A prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor reduces tau pathology in cellular models and in mice with tauopathy.,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, higher-order aggregates, and tau filaments. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major tau dephosphorylating phosphatase, and a decrease in its activity has been demonstrated in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. Prolyl oligopeptidase is a serine protease that is associated with neurodegeneration, and its inhibition normalizes PP2A activity without toxicity under pathological conditions. Here, we assessed whether prolyl oligopeptidase inhibition could protect against tau-mediated toxicity in cellular models in vitro and in the PS19 transgenic mouse model of tauopathy carrying the human tau-P301S mutation. We show that inhibition of prolyl oligopeptidase with the inhibitor KYP-2047 reduced tau aggregation in tau-transfected HEK-293 cells and N2A cells as well as in human iPSC-derived neurons carrying either the P301L or tau-A152T mutation. Treatment with KYP-2047 resulted in increased PP2A activity and activation of autophagic flux in HEK-293 cells and N2A cells and in patient-derived iNeurons, as indicated by changes in autophagosome and autophagy receptor markers; this contributed to clearance of insoluble tau. Furthermore, treatment of PS19 transgenic mice for 1 month with KYP-2047 reduced tau burden in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid and slowed cognitive decline according to several behavioral tests. In addition, a reduction in an oxidative stress marker was seen in mouse brains after KYP-2047 treatment. This study suggests that inhibition of prolyl oligopeptidase could help to ameliorate tau-dependent neurodegeneration.",2023,,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Prolyl Oligopeptidases; HEK293 Cells; Tauopathies; tau Proteins; Mice, Transgenic; Serine Endopeptidases; Enzyme Inhibitors; Disease Models, Animal","Eteläinen, TS; Silva, MC; Uhari-Väänänen, JK; De Lorenzo, F; Jäntti, MH; Cui, H; Chavero-Pieres, M; Kilpeläinen, T; Mechtler, C; Svarcbahs, R; Seppälä, E; Savinainen, JR; Puris, E; Fricker, G; Gynther, M; Julku, UH; Huttunen, HJ; Haggarty, SJ; Myöhänen, TT"

Sex-specific age-related changes in glymphatic function assessed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.,"The glymphatic system that clears out brain wastes, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow may play an important role in aging and dementias. However, a lack of non-invasive tools to assess the glymphatic function in humans hindered the understanding of the glymphatic changes in healthy aging. The global infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) brain activity measured by the global mean resting-state fMRI signal (gBOLD) was recently found to be coupled by large CSF movements. This coupling has been used to measure the glymphatic process and found to correlate with various pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including Aβ pathology. Using resting-state fMRI data from a large group of 719 healthy aging participants, we examined the sex-specific changes of the gBOLD-CSF coupling, as a measure of glymphatic function, over a wide age range between 36-100 years old. We found that this coupling index remains stable before around age 55 and then starts to decline afterward, particularly in females.

Prognostic value of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease.,"We performed a retrospective analysis of the patients assessed at our memory unit for whom Alzheimer disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid biomarker results were available.

Of the 588 cases reviewed, 110 met the inclusion criteria. During follow-up, 50 cases (45.45%) progressed to dementia due to AD. Baseline levels of total and phosphorylated tau were higher in the group of patients that progressed to dementia than in those remaining with mild cognitive impairment. After adjusting for age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes, and educational level, a 10% increase in total tau protein values was associated with a 7.60% increase in the risk of progression to dementia (hazard ratio: 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.84]; P = .004).

"Vascular dementia subtypes, pathophysiology, genetics, neuroimaging, biomarkers, and treatment updates along with its association with Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes mellitus.","Dementia is a chronic progressive cognitive decline illness that results in functional impairment. Vascular dementia (VaD), second only to Alzheimer's disease (AD), is one of the most prevalent forms of dementia in the elderly (aged over 65 years), with a varied presentation and unpredictable disease development caused by cerebrovascular or cardiovascular illness. To get a better understanding of the changes occurring in the brain and to drive therapy efforts, new biomarkers for early and precise diagnosis of AD and VaD are required.

Age-related alterations in meningeal immunity drive impaired CNS lymphatic drainage.,"The meningeal lymphatic network enables the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and facilitates the removal of central nervous system (CNS) waste. During aging and in Alzheimer's disease, impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage promotes the buildup of toxic misfolded proteins in the CNS. Reversing this age-related dysfunction represents a promising strategy to augment CNS waste clearance; however, the mechanisms underlying this decline remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that age-related alterations in meningeal immunity underlie this lymphatic impairment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells from aged mice revealed their response to IFNγ, which was increased in the aged meninges due to T cell accumulation. Chronic elevation of meningeal IFNγ in young mice via AAV-mediated overexpression attenuated CSF drainage-comparable to the deficits observed in aged mice. Therapeutically, IFNγ neutralization alleviated age-related impairments in meningeal lymphatic function. These data suggest manipulation of meningeal immunity as a viable approach to normalize CSF drainage and alleviate the neurological deficits associated with impaired waste removal.",2023,,Mice; Animals; Endothelial Cells; Central Nervous System; Meninges; Lymphatic Vessels; Alzheimer Disease; Lymphatic System; Brain,"Rustenhoven, J; Pavlou, G; Storck, SE; Dykstra, T; Du, S; Wan, Z; Quintero, D; Scallan, JP; Smirnov, I; Kamm, RD; Kipnis, J"

We investigated the relationships between 10 CSF proteins and network integrity in mutation carriers (N=219) and noncarriers (N=136) of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Observational study. Abnormalities in Aβ, Tau, synaptic (SNAP-25, neurogranin) and neuronal calcium-sensor protein (VILIP-1) preceded grey matter network disruptions by several years, while inflammation related (YKL-40) and axonal injury (NfL) abnormalities co-occurred and correlated with network integrity.

The recently developed Gaussian mirror (GM) and Model-X (MX) knockoff-based methods have much related model assumptions, which makes them appealing for the detection of new biomarkers. However, there are no guidelines for their practical use. In this research, we systematically compared the performance of MX-based and GM methods, where the impacts of the distribution of explanatory variables, their relatedness and the signal-to-noise ratio were evaluated. MX with knockoff generated using the second-order approximates (MX-SO) has the best performance as compared to other MX-based methods. MX-SO and GM have similar levels of power and computational speed under most of the simulations, but GM is more robust in the control of false discovery rate (FDR). In particular, MX-SO can only control the FDR well when there are weak correlations among explanatory variables and the sample size is at least moderate. On the contrary, GM can have the desired FDR as long as explanatory variables are not highly correlated. We further used GM and MX-based methods to detect biomarkers that are associated with the Alzheimer's disease-related PET-imaging trait and the Parkinson's disease-related T-tau of cerebrospinal fluid. We found that MX-based and GM methods are both powerful for the analysis of big biological data. Although genes selected from MX-based methods are more similar as compared to those from the GM method, both MX-based and GM methods can identify the well-known disease-associated genes for each disease. While MX-based methods can have a slightly higher power than that of the GM method, it is less robust, especially for data with small sample sizes, unknown distributions, and high correlations.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Phenotype; Normal Distribution; Parkinson Disease,"Chen, S; Li, Z; Liu, L; Wen, Y"

Precise profiling of exosomal biomarkers via programmable curved plasmonic nanoarchitecture-based biosensor for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of complex pathogenesis, with overt symptoms following disease progression. Early AD diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of robust biomarkers and limited patient access to diagnostics via neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests. Exosomes present in body fluids are attracting attention as diagnostic biomarkers that directly reflect neuropathological features within the brain. In particular, exosomal miRNAs (exomiRs) signatures are involved in AD pathogenesis, showing a different expression between patients and the healthy controls (HCs). However, low yield and high homologous nature impede the accuracy and reproducibility of exosome blood-based AD diagnostics. Here, we developed a programmable curved plasmonic nanoarchitecture-based biosensor to analyze exomiRs in clinical serum samples for accurate AD diagnosis. To allow the detection of exomiRs in serum at attomolar levels, nanospaces (e.g., nanocrevice and nanocavity) were introduced into the nanostructures to dramatically increase the spectral sensitivity by adjusting the bending angle of the plasmonic nanostructure through sodium chloride concentration control. The developed biosensor classifies individuals into AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and HCs through profiling and quantifying exomiRs. Furthermore, integrating analysis expression patterns of multiple exosomal biomarkers improved serum-based diagnostic performance (average accuracy of 98.22%). Therefore, precise, highly sensitive serum-derived exosomal biomarker detection-based plasmonic biosensor has a robust capacity to predict the molecular pathologic of neurodegenerative disease, progression of cognitive decline, MCI/AD conversion, as well as early diagnosis and treatment.",2023,Alzheimer's disease (AD); Exosome; Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs); Liquid biopsy; Plasmonic biosensors; miRNA,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Reproducibility of Results; Biosensing Techniques; Biomarkers; MicroRNAs; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Progression,"Song, S; Lee, JU; Jeon, MJ; Kim, S; Lee, CN; Sim, SJ"

The effect of aquaporin-4 mis-localization on Aβ deposition in mice.,"The reduced clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to contribute to the development of the pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by the deposition of Aβ plaques. Previous studies have shown that Aβ is cleared via the glymphatic system, a brain-wide network of perivascular pathways that supports the exchange between cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid within the brain. Such exchange is dependent upon the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4), localized at astrocytic endfeet. While prior studies have shown that both the loss and mislocalization of AQP4 slow Aβ clearance and promote Aβ plaque formation, the relative impact of the loss or mislocalization of AQP4 on Aβ deposition has never been directly compared. In this study, we evaluated how the deposition of Aβ plaques within the 5XFAD mouse line is impacted by either Aqp4 gene deletion or the loss of AQP4 localization in the α-syntrophin (Snta1) knockout mouse. We observed that both the absence (Aqp4 KO) and mislocalization (Snta1 KO) of AQP4 significantly increases the parenchymal Aβ plaque and microvascular Aβ deposition across the brain, when compared with 5XFAD littermate controls. Further, the mislocalization of AQP4 had a more pronounced impact on Aβ plaque deposition than did global Aqp4 gene deletion, perhaps pointing to a key role that mislocalization of perivascular AQP4 plays in AD pathogenesis.",2023,"AQP4; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid β, perivascular; Astrocytes; Glymphatic system; SNTA1; α syntrophin","Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Aquaporin 4; Brain; Glymphatic System; Mice, Knockout","Pedersen, TJ; Keil, SA; Han, W; Wang, MX; Iliff, JJ"
The neuronal pentraxin Nptx2 regulates complement activity and restrains microglia-mediated synapse loss in neurodegeneration.,"Complement overactivation mediates microglial synapse elimination in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but how complement activity is regulated in the brain remains largely unknown. We identified that the secreted neuronal pentraxin Nptx2 binds complement C1q and thereby regulates its activity in the brain. Nptx2-deficient mice show increased complement activity, C1q-dependent microglial synapse engulfment, and loss of excitatory synapses. In a neuroinflammation culture model and in aged TauP301S mice, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated neuronal overexpression of Nptx2 was sufficient to restrain complement activity and ameliorate microglia-mediated synapse loss. Analysis of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a genetic FTD cohort revealed reduced concentrations of Nptx2 and Nptx2-C1q protein complexes in symptomatic patients, which correlated with elevated C1q and activated C3. Together, these results show that Nptx2 regulates complement activity and microglial synapse elimination in the brain and that diminished Nptx2 concentrations might exacerbate complement-mediated neurodegeneration in patients with FTD.",2023,,Humans; Mice; Animals; Aged; Microglia; Complement C1q; Frontotemporal Dementia; Synapses; Complement System Proteins,"Zhou, J; Wade, SD; Graykowski, D; Xiao, MF; Zhao, B; Giannini, LAA; Hanson, JE; van Swieten, JC; Sheng, M; Worley, PF; Dejanovic, B"
"Artificial intelligence velocimetry reveals in vivo flow rates, pressure gradients, and shear stresses in murine perivascular flows.","Quantifying the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial for understanding brain waste clearance and nutrient delivery, as well as edema in pathological conditions such as stroke. However, existing in vivo techniques are limited to sparse velocity measurements in pial perivascular spaces (PVSs) or low-resolution measurements from brain-wide imaging. Additionally, volume flow rate, pressure, and shear stress variation in PVSs are essentially impossible to measure in vivo. Here, we show that artificial intelligence velocimetry (AIV) can integrate sparse velocity measurements with physics-informed neural networks to quantify CSF flow in PVSs. With AIV, we infer three-dimensional (3D), high-resolution velocity, pressure, and shear stress. Validation comes from training with 70% of PTV measurements and demonstrating close agreement with the remaining 30%. A sensitivity analysis on the AIV inputs shows that the uncertainty in AIV inferred quantities due to uncertainties in the PVS boundary locations inherent to in vivo imaging is less than 30%, and the uncertainty from the neural net initialization is less than 1%.

Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers Reduce Tau/Aß42 Ratio: A Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers' Case-Control Study.,"(1) Background: The role of antihypertensives in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) prevention is controversial. This case-control study aims to assess whether antihypertensive medication has a protective role by studying its association with amyloid and tau abnormal levels. Furthermore, it suggests a holistic view of the involved pathways between renin-angiotensin drugs and the tau/amyloidß42 ratio (tau/Aß42 ratio); (2) Methods: The medical records of the participant patients were reviewed, with a focus on prescribed antihypertensive drugs and clinical variables, such as arterial blood pressure. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification was used to classify each drug. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with AD diagnosis (cases) and cognitively healthy patients (control); (3) Results: Age and high systolic blood pressure are associated with a higher risk of developing AD. In addition, combinations of angiotensin II receptor blockers are associated with a 30% lower t-tau/Aß42 ratio than plain angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor consumption; (4) Conclusions: Angiotensin II receptor blockers may play a potential role in neuroprotection and AD prevention. Likewise, several mechanisms, such as the PI3K/Akt/GSK3ß or the ACE1/AngII/AT1R axis, may link cardiovascular pathologies and AD presence, making its modulation a pivotal point in AD prevention.

Extracellular Matrix Changes in Subcellular Brain Fractions and Cerebrospinal Fluid of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) is assumed to undergo rearrangements in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated changes of key components of the hyaluronan-based ECM in independent samples of post-mortem brains (N = 19), cerebrospinal fluids (CSF; N = 70), and RNAseq data (N = 107; from The Aging, Dementia and TBI Study) of AD patients and non-demented controls. Group comparisons and correlation analyses of major ECM components in soluble and synaptosomal fractions from frontal, temporal cortex, and hippocampus of control, low-grade, and high-grade AD brains revealed a reduction in brevican in temporal cortex soluble and frontal cortex synaptosomal fractions in AD. In contrast, neurocan, aggrecan and the link protein HAPLN1 were up-regulated in soluble cortical fractions. In comparison, RNAseq data showed no correlation between aggrecan and brevican expression levels and Braak or CERAD stages, but for hippocampal expression of HAPLN1, neurocan and the brevican-interaction partner tenascin-R negative correlations with Braak stages were detected. CSF levels of brevican and neurocan in patients positively correlated with age, total tau, p-Tau, neurofilament-L and Aβ1-40. Negative correlations were detected with the Aβ ratio and the IgG index.

Seed amplification and neurodegeneration marker trajectories in individuals at risk of prion disease.,"Human prion diseases are remarkable for long incubation times followed typically by rapid clinical decline. Seed amplification assays and neurodegeneration biofluid biomarkers are remarkably useful in the clinical phase, but their potential to predict clinical onset in healthy people remains unclear. This is relevant not only to the design of preventive strategies in those at-risk of prion diseases, but more broadly, because prion-like mechanisms are thought to underpin many neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report the accrual of a longitudinal biofluid resource in patients, controls and healthy people at risk of prion diseases, to which ultrasensitive techniques such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and single molecule array (Simoa) digital immunoassays were applied for preclinical biomarker discovery. We studied 648 CSF and plasma samples, including 16 people who had samples taken when healthy but later developed inherited prion disease (IPD) ('converters'; range from 9.9 prior to, and 7.4 years after onset). Symptomatic IPD CSF samples were screened by RT-QuIC assay variations, before testing the entire collection of at-risk samples using the most sensitive assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), tau and UCH-L1 levels were measured in plasma and CSF. Second generation (IQ-CSF) RT-QuIC proved 100% sensitive and specific for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), iatrogenic and familial CJD phenotypes, and subsequently detected seeding activity in four presymptomatic CSF samples from three E200K carriers; one converted in under 2 months while two remain asymptomatic after at least 3 years' follow-up. A bespoke HuPrP P102L RT-QuIC showed partial sensitivity for P102L disease. No compatible RT-QuIC assay was discovered for classical 6-OPRI, A117V and D178N, and these at-risk samples tested negative with bank vole RT-QuIC. Plasma GFAP and NfL, and CSF NfL levels emerged as proximity markers of neurodegeneration in the typically slow IPDs (e.g. P102L), with significant differences in mean values segregating healthy control from IPD carriers (within 2 years to onset) and symptomatic IPD cohorts; plasma GFAP appears to change before NfL, and before clinical conversion. In conclusion, we show distinct biomarker trajectories in fast and slow IPDs. Specifically, we identify several years of presymptomatic seeding positivity in E200K, a new proximity marker (plasma GFAP) and sequential neurodegenerative marker evolution (plasma GFAP followed by NfL) in slow IPDs. We suggest a new preclinical staging system featuring clinical, seeding and neurodegeneration aspects, for validation with larger prion at-risk cohorts, and with potential application to other neurodegenerative proteopathies.",2023,GFAP; NfL; RT-QuIC; inherited; prion,Humans; tau Proteins; Prion Diseases; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Prions; Biomarkers,"Mok, TH; Nihat, A; Majbour, N; Sequeira, D; Holm-Mercer, L; Coysh, T; Darwent, L; Batchelor, M; Groveman, BR; Orr, CD; Hughson, AG; Heslegrave, A; Laban, R; Veleva, E; Paterson, RW; Keshavan, A; Schott, JM; Swift, IJ; Heller, C; Rohrer, JD; Gerhard, A; Butler, C; Rowe, JB; Masellis, M; Chapman, M; Lunn, MP; Bieschke, J; Jackson, GS; Zetterberg, H; Caughey, B; Rudge, P; Collinge, J; Mead, S"

Identification of plasma metabolites associated with modifiable risk factors and endophenotypes reflecting Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"Modifiable factors can influence the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and serve as targets for intervention; however, the biological mechanisms linking these factors to AD are unknown. This study aims to identify plasma metabolites associated with modifiable factors for AD, including MIND diet, physical activity, smoking, and caffeine intake, and test their association with AD endophenotypes to identify their potential roles in pathophysiological mechanisms. The association between each of the 757 plasma metabolites and four modifiable factors was tested in the wisconsin registry for Alzheimer's prevention cohort of initially cognitively unimpaired, asymptomatic middle-aged adults. After Bonferroni correction, the significant plasma metabolites were tested for association with each of the AD endophenotypes, including twelve cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, reflecting key pathophysiologies for AD, and four cognitive composite scores. Finally, causal mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate possible mediation effects. Analyses were performed using linear mixed-effects regression. A total of 27, 3, 23, and 24 metabolites were associated with MIND diet, physical activity, smoking, and caffeine intake, respectively. Potential mediation effects include beta-cryptoxanthin in the association between MIND diet and preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite score, hippurate between MIND diet and immediate learning, glutamate between physical activity and CSF neurofilament light, and beta-cryptoxanthin between smoking and immediate learning.

Associations of ApoE4 status and DHA supplementation on plasma and CSF lipid profiles and entorhinal cortex thickness.,"Apolipoprotein ε allele 4 (APOE4) influences the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The entorhinal cortex (EC) in the brain is affected early in Alzheimer's disease and is rich in DHA. The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of APOE4 and DHA lipid species on the EC. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipidomic measurements were obtained from the DHA Brain Delivery Pilot, a randomized clinical trial of DHA supplementation (n = 10) versus placebo (n = 12) for six months in nondemented older adults stratified by APOE4 status. Wild-type C57B6/J mice were fed a high or low DHA diet for 6 months followed by plasma and brain lipidomic analysis. Levels of phosphatidylcholine DHA (PC 38:6) and cholesterol ester DHA (CE 22:6) had the largest increases in CSF following supplementation (P < 0.001). DHA within triglyceride (TG) lipids in CSF strongly correlated with corresponding plasma TG lipids, and differed by APOE4, with carriers having a lower increase than noncarriers. Changes in plasma PC DHA had the strongest association with changes in EC thickness in millimeters, independent of APOE4 status (P = 0.007). In mice, a high DHA diet increased PUFAs within brain lipids. Our findings demonstrate an exchange of DHA at the CSF-blood barrier and into the brain within all lipid species with APOE having the strongest effect on DHA-containing TGs.

The brain's weakness in the face of trauma: How head trauma causes the destruction of the brain.,"Of all our organs, the brain is perhaps the best protected from trauma. The skull has evolved to enclose it and, within the skull, the brain floats in a protective bath of cerebrospinal fluid. It is becoming evident, however, that head trauma experienced in young adult life can cause a dementia that appears decades later. The level of trauma that induces such destruction is still being assessed but includes levels well below that which cracks the skull or causes unconsciousness or concussion. Clinically this damage appears as dementia, in people who played body-contact sports in their youth or have survived accidents or the blasts of combat; and appears also, we argue, in old age, without a history of head trauma. The dementias have been given different names, including dementia pugilistica (affecting boxers), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (following certain sports, particularly football), traumatic brain injury (following accidents, combat) and Alzheimer's (following decades of life). They share common features of clinical presentation and neuropathology, and this conceptual analysis seeks to identify features common to these forms of brain injury and to identify where in the brain the damage common to them occurs; and how it occurs, despite the protection provided by the skull and cerebrospinal fluid. The analysis suggests that the brain's weak point in the face of trauma is its capillary bed, which is torn by the shock of trauma. This identification in turn allows discussion of ways of delaying, avoiding and even treating these trauma-induced degenerations.",2023,Alzheimer’s; CTE; concussion; dementia pugilistica; head trauma; neurodegeneration,,"Johnstone, DM; Mitrofanis, J; Stone, J"

Screening over Speech in Unselected Populations for Clinical Trials in AD (PROSPECT-AD): Study Design and Protocol.,"Speech impairments are an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and consequently, analysing speech performance is a promising new digital biomarker for AD screening. Future clinical AD trials on disease modifying drugs will require a shift to very early identification of individuals at risk of dementia. Hence, digital markers of language and speech may offer a method for screening of at-risk populations that are at the earliest stages of AD, eventually in combination with advanced machine learning. To this end, we developed a screening battery consisting of speech-based neurocognitive tests.

Predictive Utility of Plasma Amyloid and Tau for Cognitive Decline in Cognitively Normal Adults.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting mostly elderly adults. Recent diagnostic criteria for AD recommend the use of imaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers together with clinical presentation for a more persuasive diagnosis. The invasiveness and expense of such examinations have led to the search for blood-based biomarkers. The plasma levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein and tau peptides have been found to correlate with CSF levels and imaging findings in patients with AD. This study was conducted to explore the predictive utility of plasma Aβ1-42 and total tau (t-tau) levels for cognitive decline in healthy adults.,2023,Amyloid beta; Plasma biomarkers; Tau protein; mild cognitive impairment; normal cognition,Aged; Humans; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Prospective Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Lee, YJ; Lin, SY; Peng, SW; Lin, YC; Chen, TB; Wang, PN; Cheng, IH"
"Decreased functional connectivity is associated with increased levels of Cerebral Spinal Fluid soluble-PDGFRβ, a marker of blood brain barrier breakdown, in older adults.","Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is suggested to be cross-sectionally associated with both vascular burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. For instance, studies in pre-clinical AD subjects have shown increases of cerebral spinal fluid soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (CSF sPDGFRβ, a marker of BBB breakdown) but have not demonstrated if this vascular impairment affects neuronal dysfunction. It's possible that increased levels of sPDGFRβ in the CSF may correlate with impaired FC in metabolically demanding brain regions (i.e. Default Mode Network, DMN). Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between these two markers in older individuals that were cognitively normal and had cognitive impairment. Eighty-nine older adults without dementia from the University of Southern California were selected from a larger cohort. Region of interest (ROI) to ROI analyses were conducted using DMN seed regions. Linear regression models measured significant associations between BOLD FC strength among seed-target regions and sPDGFRβ values, while covarying for age and sex. Comparison of a composite ROI created by averaging FC values between seed and all target regions among cognitively normal and impaired individuals was also examined. Using CSF sPDGFRβ as a biomarker of BBB breakdown, we report that increased breakdown correlated with decreased functional connectivity in DMN areas, specifically the PCC while the hippocampus exhibited an interaction effect using CDR score. We conclude that BBB breakdown as measured by CSF sPDGFRβ affects neural networks resulting in decreased functional connections that leads to cognitive dysfunction.",2023,BBB breakdown; cognitive impairment; default mode network (DMN); resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI); soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (sPDGFRβ),,"Contreras, JA; Fujisaki, K; Ortega, N; Barisano, G; Sagare, A; Pappas, I; Chui, H; Ringman, JM; Joe, EB; Zlokovic, B; Toga, AW; Pa, J"

Beyond the amyloid hypothesis: how current research implicates autoimmunity in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"The amyloid hypothesis has so far been at the forefront of explaining the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and eventual death. Recent evidence, however, points to additional factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. These include the neurovascular hypothesis, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, the prion hypothesis, the mutational accumulation hypothesis, and the autoimmunity hypothesis. The purpose of this review was to briefly discuss the factors that are associated with autoimmunity in humans, including sex, the gut and lung microbiomes, age, genetics, and environmental factors. Subsequently, it was to examine the rise of autoimmune phenomena in AD, which can be instigated by a blood-brain barrier breakdown, pathogen infections, and dysfunction of the glymphatic system. Lastly, it was to discuss the various ways by which immune system dysregulation leads to AD, immunomodulating therapies, and future directions in the field of autoimmunity and neurodegeneration. A comprehensive account of the recent research done in the field was extracted from PubMed on 31 January 2022, with the keywords ""Alzheimer's disease"" and ""autoantibodies"" for the first search input, and ""Alzheimer's disease"" with ""IgG"" for the second. From the first search, 19 papers were selected, because they contained recent research on the autoantibodies found in the biofluids of patients with AD. From the second search, four papers were selected. The analysis of the literature has led to support the autoimmune hypothesis in AD. Autoantibodies were found in biofluids (serum/plasma, cerebrospinal fluid) of patients with AD with multiple methods, including ELISA, Mass Spectrometry, and microarray analysis. Through continuous research, the understanding of the synergistic effects of the various components that lead to AD will pave the way for better therapeutic methods and a deeper understanding of the disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Autoantibodies; amyloid hypothesis; autoimmunity; biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Autoimmunity; Autoantibodies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Chatanaka, MK; Sohaei, D; Diamandis, EP; Prassas, I"

Magnetic resonance evidence of increased iron content in subcortical brain regions in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.,"While iron over-accumulation has been reported in late stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), whether this occurs early in the asymptomatic stage of AD remains unknown. We aimed to assess brain iron levels in asymptomatic AD using quantitative MR relaxometry of effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) and longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), and recruited 118 participants comprised of three groups including healthy young participants, and cognitively normal older individuals without or with positive AD biomarkers based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics analysis. Compared with the healthy young group, increased R2* was found in widespread cortical and subcortical regions in the older groups. Further, significantly higher levels of R2* were found in the cognitively normal older subjects with positive CSF AD biomarker (i.e., asymptomatic AD) compared with those with negative AD biomarker in subcortical regions including the left and right caudate, left and right putamen, and left and right globus pallidus (p < .05 for all regions), suggesting increased iron content in these regions. Subcortical R2* of some regions was found to significantly correlate with CSF AD biomarkers and neuropsychological assessments of visuospatial functions. In conclusion, R2* could be a valuable biomarker for studying early pathophysiological changes in AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; aging; beta-amyloid; grey matter; iron deposition; quantitative magnetic resonance imaging; subcortical,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Iron; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Lin, Q; Shahid, S; Hone-Blanchet, A; Huang, S; Wu, J; Bisht, A; Loring, D; Goldstein, F; Levey, A; Crosson, B; Lah, J; Qiu, D"
Plasma phospho-tau in Alzheimer's disease: towards diagnostic and therapeutic trial applications.,"As the leading cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major burden on affected individuals, their families and caregivers, and healthcare systems. Although AD can be identified and diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid or neuroimaging biomarkers that concord with neuropathological evidence and clinical symptoms, challenges regarding practicality and accessibility hinder their widespread availability and implementation. Consequently, many people with suspected cognitive impairment due to AD do not receive a biomarker-supported diagnosis. Blood biomarkers have the capacity to help expand access to AD diagnostics worldwide. One such promising biomarker is plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau), which has demonstrated specificity to AD versus non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, and will be extremely important to inform on clinical diagnosis and eligibility for therapies that have recently been approved. This review provides an update on the diagnostic and prognostic performances of plasma p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231, and their associations with in vivo and autopsy-verified diagnosis and pathological hallmarks. Additionally, we discuss potential applications and unanswered questions of plasma p-tau for therapeutic trials, given their recent addition to the biomarker toolbox for participant screening, recruitment and during-trial monitoring.

"The effect of a novel AQP4 facilitator, TGN-073, on glymphatic transport captured by diffusion MRI and DCE-MRI.","The glymphatic system is a low resistance pathway, by which cerebrospinal fluid enters the brain parenchyma along perivascular spaces via AQP4 channels. It is hypothesised that the resulting convective flow of the interstitial fluid provides an efficient mechanism for the removal of waste toxins from the brain. Therefore, enhancing AQP4 function might protect against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which the accumulation of harmful proteins and solutes is a hallmark feature. Here, we test the effect of a putative AQP4 facilitator, TGN-073, on glymphatic transport in a normal rat brain by employing different MRI techniques. Surgical procedures were undertaken to catheterise the cisterna magna, thereby enabling infusion of the MRI tracer. Followed by the intraperitoneal injection of either TGN-073, or the vehicle. Using a paramagnetic contrast agent (Gd-DTPA) as the MRI tracer, dynamic 3D T1 weighted imaging of the glymphatic system was undertaken over two hours. Further, the apparent diffusion coefficient was measured in different brain regions using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). While physiological parameters and arterial blood gas analysis were monitored continuously. We found that rats treated with TGN-073 showed the distribution of Gd-DTPA was more extensive and parenchymal uptake was higher compared with the vehicle group. Water diffusivity was increased in the brain of TGN-073 treated group, which indicates greater water flux. Also, MRI showed the glymphatic transport and distribution in the brain is naturally heterogeneous, which is consistent with previous studies. Our results indicate that compounds such as TGN-073 can improve glymphatic function in the brain. Since glymphatic impairment due to AQP4 dysfunction is potentially associated with several neurological disorders such as AD, dementia and traumatic brain injury, enhancing AQP4 functionality might be a promising therapeutic target.",2023,,Animals; Rats; Aquaporin 4; Brain; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gadolinium DTPA; Glymphatic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Alghanimy, A; Martin, C; Gallagher, L; Holmes, WM"

"Brain washing and neural health: role of age, sleep, and the cerebrospinal fluid melatonin rhythm.","The brain lacks a classic lymphatic drainage system. How it is cleansed of damaged proteins, cellular debris, and molecular by-products has remained a mystery for decades. Recent discoveries have identified a hybrid system that includes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled perivascular spaces and classic lymph vessels in the dural covering of the brain and spinal cord that functionally cooperate to remove toxic and non-functional trash from the brain. These two components functioning together are referred to as the glymphatic system. We propose that the high levels of melatonin secreted by the pineal gland directly into the CSF play a role in flushing pathological molecules such as amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) from the brain via this network. Melatonin is a sleep-promoting agent, with waste clearance from the CNS being highest especially during slow wave sleep. Melatonin is also a potent and versatile antioxidant that prevents neural accumulation of oxidatively-damaged molecules which contribute to neurological decline. Due to its feedback actions on the suprachiasmatic nucleus, CSF melatonin rhythm functions to maintain optimal circadian rhythmicity, which is also critical for preserving neurocognitive health. Melatonin levels drop dramatically in the frail aged, potentially contributing to neurological failure and dementia. Melatonin supplementation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) defers Aβ accumulation, enhances its clearance from the CNS, and prolongs animal survival. In AD patients, preliminary data show that melatonin use reduces neurobehavioral signs such as sundowning. Finally, melatonin controls the mitotic activity of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting its involvement in neuronal renewal.",2023,Apoptosis; Brain metabolism; Brain ventricles; CSF flow; Dural lymphatics; Glioblastoma; Glymphatic system; Lumbar cistern; Neurodegenerative diseases; Redox homeostasis; Subventricular zone; Tau protein; Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces,Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Melatonin; Sleep; Glymphatic System; Aging; Humans,"Reiter, RJ; Sharma, R; Cucielo, MS; Tan, DX; Rosales-Corral, S; Gancitano, G; de Almeida Chuffa, LG"

Progress in blood biomarkers of subjective cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that gradually impairs cognitive functions. Recently, there has been a conceptual shift toward AD to view the disease as a continuum. Since AD is currently incurable, effective intervention to delay or prevent pathological cognitive decline may best target the early stages of symptomatic disease, such as subjective cognitive decline (SCD), in which cognitive function remains relatively intact. Diagnostic methods for identifying AD, such as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography, are invasive and expensive. Therefore, it is imperative to develop blood biomarkers that are sensitive, less invasive, easier to access, and more cost effective for AD diagnosis. This review aimed to summarize the current data on whether individuals with SCD differ reliably and effectively in subjective and objective performances compared to cognitively normal elderly individuals, and to find one or more convenient and accessible blood biomarkers so that researchers can identify SCD patients with preclinical AD in the population as soon as possible. Owing to the heterogeneity and complicated pathogenesis of AD, it is difficult to make reliable diagnoses using only a single blood marker. This review provides an overview of the progress achieved to date with the use of SCD blood biomarkers in patients with preclinical AD, highlighting the key areas of application and current challenges.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Biomarkers,"Yu, X; Shao, K; Wan, K; Li, T; Li, Y; Zhu, X; Han, Y"
Associations between self-reported sleep quality and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,"Sleep disorders are very common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

However, there is limited evidence for the relationship between self-reported sleep impairment and disease biomarkers. In this study, we assessed the relationship between self-reported sleep complaints, with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and both cognitive function and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in 70 patients with MCI and 78 patients with AD.

Automatic segmentation of the choroid plexuses: Method and validation in controls and patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Choroid Plexuses (ChP) are structures located in the ventricles that produce the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central nervous system. They are also a key component of the blood-CSF barrier. Recent studies have described clinically relevant ChP volumetric changes in several neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, a reliable and automated tool for ChP segmentation on images derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial need for large studies attempting to elucidate their role in neurological disorders. Here, we propose a novel automatic method for ChP segmentation in large imaging datasets. The approach is based on a 2-step 3D U-Net to keep preprocessing steps to a minimum for ease of use and to lower memory requirements. The models are trained and validated on a first research cohort including people with MS and healthy subjects. A second validation is also performed on a cohort of pre-symptomatic MS patients having acquired MRIs in routine clinical practice. Our method reaches an average Dice coefficient of 0.72 ± 0.01 with the ground truth and a volume correlation of 0.86 on the first cohort while outperforming FreeSurfer and FastSurfer-based ChP segmentations.

Cerebrospinal Fluid and Brain Proteoforms of the Granin Neuropeptide Family in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The granin neuropeptide family is composed of acidic secretory signaling molecules that act throughout the nervous system to help modulate synaptic signaling and neural activity. Granin neuropeptides have been shown to be dysregulated in different forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have suggested that the granin neuropeptides and their protease-cleaved bioactive peptides (proteoforms) may act as both powerful drivers of gene expression and as a biomarker of synaptic health in AD. The complexity of granin proteoforms in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue has not been directly addressed. We developed a reliable nontryptic mass spectrometry assay to comprehensively map and quantify endogenous neuropeptide proteoforms in the brain and CSF of individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to AD compared to healthy controls, individuals with preserved cognition despite AD pathology (""Resilient""), and those with impaired cognition but no AD or other discernible pathology (""Frail""). We drew associations between neuropeptide proteoforms, cognitive status, and AD pathology values. Decreased levels of VGF proteoforms were observed in CSF and brain tissue from individuals with AD compared to controls, while select proteoforms from chromogranin A showed the opposite effect. To address mechanisms of neuropeptide proteoform regulation, we showed that the proteases Calpain-1 and Cathepsin S can cleave chromogranin A, secretogranin-1, and VGF into proteoforms found in both the brain and CSF. We were unable to demonstrate differences in protease abundance in protein extracts from matched brains, suggesting that regulation may occur at the level of transcription.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Chromogranins; Chromogranin A; Peptide Fragments; Neuropeptides; Brain; Biomarkers; Peptide Hydrolases; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Quinn, JP; Ethier, EC; Novielli, A; Malone, A; Ramirez, CE; Salloum, L; Trombetta, BA; Kivisäkk, P; Bremang, M; Selzer, S; Fournier, M; Das, S; Xing, Y; Arnold, SE; Carlyle, BC"

PASSED: Brain atrophy in non-demented individuals in a long-term longitudinal study from two independent cohorts.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is indicated by a decrease in amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) level or the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, and by increased levels of Tau with phosphorylated threonine at position 181 (pTau181) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) years before the onset of clinical symptoms. However, once only pTau181 is increased, cognitive decline in individuals with subjective or mild cognitive impairment is slowed compared to individuals with AD. Instead of a decrease in Aβ42 levels, an increase in Aβ42 was observed in these individuals, leading to the proposal to refer to them as nondemented subjects with increased pTau-levels and Aβ surge with subtle cognitive deterioration (PASSED). In this study, we determined the longitudinal atrophy rates of AD, PASSED, and Biomarker-negative nondemented individuals of two independent cohorts to determine whether these groups can be distinguished by their longitudinal atrophy patterns or rates.",2023,ATN classification; Alzheimer disease/physiopathology*; SNAP; amyloid beta-peptides/cerebrospinal fluid*; longitudinal studies; magnetic resonance imaging; medial temporal lobe; tau proteins/cerebrospinal fluid*,,"Haas, AL; Olm, P; Utz, J; Siegmann, EM; Spitzer, P; Florvaag, A; Schmidt, MA; Doerfler, A; Lewczuk, P; Kornhuber, J; Maler, JM; Oberstein, TJ"

Transferability of Alzheimer's disease progression subtypes to an independent population cohort.,"In the past, methods to subtype or biotype patients using brain imaging data have been developed. However, it is unclear whether and how these trained machine learning models can be successfully applied to population cohorts to study the genetic and lifestyle factors underpinning these subtypes. This work, using the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm, examines the generalisability of data-driven Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression models. We first compared SuStaIn models trained separately on Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) data and an AD-at-risk population constructed from the UK Biobank dataset. We further applied data harmonization techniques to remove cohort effects. Next, we built SuStaIn models on the harmonized datasets, which were then used to subtype and stage subjects in the other harmonized dataset. The first key finding is that three consistent atrophy subtypes were found in both datasets, which match the previously identified subtype progression patterns in AD: 'typical', 'cortical' and 'subcortical'. Next, the subtype agreement was further supported by high consistency in individuals' subtypes and stage assignment based on the different models: more than 92% of the subjects, with reliable subtype assignment in both ADNI and UK Biobank dataset, were assigned to an identical subtype under the model built on the different datasets. The successful transferability of AD atrophy progression subtypes across cohorts capturing different phases of disease development enabled further investigations of associations between AD atrophy subtypes and risk factors. Our study showed that (1) the average age is highest in the typical subtype and lowest in the subcortical subtype; (2) the typical subtype is associated with statistically more-AD-like cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers values in comparison to the other two subtypes; and (3) in comparison to the subcortical subtype, the cortical subtype subjects are more likely to associate with prescription of cholesterol and high blood pressure medications. In summary, we presented cross-cohort consistent recovery of AD atrophy subtypes, showing how the same subtypes arise even in cohorts capturing substantially different disease phases. Our study opened opportunities for future detailed investigations of atrophy subtypes with a broad range of early risk factors, which will potentially lead to a better understanding of the disease aetiology and the role of lifestyle and behaviour on AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Early risk factors; Modelling; Subtypes,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Brain; Atrophy; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Chen, H; Young, A; Oxtoby, NP; Barkhof, F; Alexander, DC; Altmann, A"

Redefinition of dementia care in Italy in the era of amyloid-lowering agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: an expert opinion and practical guideline.,"No disease-modifying therapies are currently available for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe. Current evidence from clinical trials testing anti-beta amyloid (Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in patients with early AD, though, suggests a likely marketing authorization in the next years. Since the implementation of disease-modifying therapies for AD in the clinical practice will evidently require a huge change of dementia care in all countries, a group of prominent AD clinical experts in Italy met to discuss patients' selection and management strategies. The current diagnostic-therapeutic standard of care in Italy was taken as the starting point. The prescription of new therapies cannot ignore the definition of a biological diagnosis through the assessment of both amyloid- and tau-related biomarkers. The high risk/benefit ratio of anti-Aβ immunotherapies, moreover, needs a highly specialized diagnostic work-up and a thorough exclusion criteria assessment, which should be provided by a neurology specialist. The Expert Panel also suggests a reorganization of the Centers for dementia and cognitive decline in Italy into 3 levels of increasing complexity: community center, first- and second-level center. Tasks and requirements for each level were defined.

Metal-Organic Frameworks as Sensors for Human Amyloid Diseases.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are versatile compounds with emergent applications in the fabrication of biosensors for amyloid diseases. They hold great potential in biospecimen protection and unprecedented probing capabilities for optical and redox receptors. In this Review, we summarize the main methodologies employed in the fabrication of MOF-based sensors for amyloid diseases and collect all available data in the literature related to their performance (detection range, limit of detection, recovery, time of analysis, among other parameters). Nowadays, MOF sensors have evolved to a point where they can, in some cases, outperform technologies employed in the detection of several amyloid biomarkers (amyloid β peptide, α-synuclein, insulin, procalcitonin, and prolactin) present in biological fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid and blood. A special emphasis has been given by researchers on Alzheimer's disease monitoring to the detriment of other amyloidosis that are underexploited despite their societal relevance (e.g., Parkinson's disease). There are still important obstacles to overcome in order to selectively detect the various peptide isoforms and soluble amyloid species associated with Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, MOF contrast agents for imaging peptide soluble oligomers in living humans are also scarce (if not nonexistent), and action in this direction is unquestionably required to clarify the contentious link between the amyloidogenic species and the disease, guiding research toward the most promising therapeutic strategies.",2023,"Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid biomarker; diagnostic; immunosensor; metal−organic frameworks, amyloid diseases, biosensor, amyloid inhibition",Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Parkinson Disease; Amyloidosis,"Leite, JP; Figueira, F; Mendes, RF; Almeida Paz, FA; Gales, L"

Protein fibril length in cerebrospinal fluid is increased in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated proteins exist in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This paper evidences that protein aggregate morphology distinctly differs in CSF of patients with AD dementia (ADD), mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI AD), with subjective cognitive decline without amyloid pathology (SCD) and with non-AD MCI using liquid-based atomic force microscopy (AFM). Spherical-shaped particles and nodular-shaped protofibrils were present in the CSF of SCD patients, whereas CSF of ADD patients abundantly contained elongated mature fibrils. Quantitative analysis of AFM topographs confirms fibril length is higher in CSF of ADD than in MCI AD and lowest in SCD and non-AD dementia patients. CSF fibril length is inversely correlated with CSF amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40 ratio and CSF p-tau protein levels (obtained from biochemical assays) to predict amyloid and tau pathology with an accuracy of 94% and 82%, respectively, thus identifying ultralong protein fibrils in CSF as a possible signature of AD pathology.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Nirmalraj, PN; Schneider, T; Lüder, L; Felbecker, A"
Molecular Biomarkers of Neuronal Injury in Epilepsy Shared with Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"In neurodegenerative diseases, changes in neuronal proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood are viewed as potential biomarkers of the primary pathology in the central nervous system (CNS).

Neurofilament light chain as neuronal injury marker - what is needed to facilitate implementation in clinical laboratory practice?,"Neurobiomarkers have attracted significant attention over the last ten years.

The marker is increasingly used clinically, as well as in clinical trials. Even if we have validated precise, sensitive, and specific assays for NfL quantification in both cerebrospinal fluid and blood, there are analytical, as well as pre- and post-analytical aspects of the total NfL testing process, including biomarker interpretation, to consider.

Protein interactors of 3-O sulfated heparan sulfates in human MCI and age-matched control cerebrospinal fluid.,"Heparan sulfates (HS) proteoglycans are commonly found on the cell surface and mediate many processes. Binding of HS ligands is determined by the sulfation code on the HS chain that can be N-/2-O/6-O- or 3-O-sulfated, generating heterogenous sulfation patterns. 3-O sulfated HS (3S-HS) play a role in several (patho)physiological processes such as blood coagulation, viral pathogenesis and binding and internalization of tau in Alzheimer's disease. However, few 3S-HS-specific interactors are known. Thus, our insight into the role of 3S-HS in health and disease is limited, especially in the central nervous system. Using human CSF, we determined the interactome of synthetic HS with defined sulfation patterns. Our affinity-enrichment mass spectrometry studies expand the repertoire of proteins that may interact with (3S-)HS. Validating our approach, ATIII, a known 3S-HS interactor, was found to require GlcA-GlcNS6S3S for binding, similar to what has been reported.

"CCR5 deficiency normalizes TIMP levels, working memory, and gamma oscillation power in APOE4 targeted replacement mice.","The APOE4 allele increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a dose-dependent manner and is also associated with cognitive decline in non-demented elderly controls. In mice with targeted gene replacement (TR) of murine APOE with human APOE3 or APOE4, the latter show reduced neuronal dendritic complexity and impaired learning. APOE4 TR mice also show reduced gamma oscillation power, a neuronal population activity which is important to learning and memory. Published work has shown that brain extracellular matrix (ECM) can reduce neuroplasticity as well as gamma power, while attenuation of ECM can instead enhance this endpoint. In the present study we examine human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from APOE3 and APOE4 individuals and brain lysates from APOE3 and APOE4 TR mice for levels of ECM effectors that can increase matrix deposition and restrict neuroplasticity. We find that CCL5, a molecule linked to ECM deposition in liver and kidney, is increased in CSF samples from APOE4 individuals. Levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which inhibit the activity of ECM-degrading enzymes, are also increased in APOE4 CSF as well as astrocyte supernatants brain lysates from APOE4 TR mice. Importantly, as compared to APOE4/wild-type heterozygotes, APOE4/CCR5 knockout heterozygotes show reduced TIMP levels and enhanced EEG gamma power.

Advances in sample preparation and HPLC-MS/MS methods for determining amyloid-β peptide in biological samples: a review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurological disorder, is a major public health concern and the most common form of dementia. Its typical symptoms include memory loss, confusion, changes in personality, and cognitive impairment, which result in patients gradually losing independence. Over the last decades, some studies have focused on searching for effective biomarkers as early diagnostic indicators of AD. Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides have been consolidated as reliable AD biomarkers and have been incorporated into modern diagnostic research criteria. However, quantitative analysis of Aβ peptides in biological samples remains a challenge because both the sample and the physical-chemical properties of these peptides are complex. During clinical routine, Aβ peptides are measured in the cerebrospinal fluid by immunoassays, but the availability of a specific antibody is critical-in some cases, an antibody may not exist, or its specificity may be inadequate, leading to low sensitivity and false results. HPLC-MS/MS has been reported as a sensitive and selective method for determining different fragments of Aβ peptides in biological samples simultaneously. Developments in sample preparation techniques (preconcentration platforms) such as immunoprecipitation, 96-well plate SPME, online SPME, and fiber-in-tube SPME have enabled not only effective enrichment of Aβ peptides present at trace levels in biological samples, but also efficient exclusion of interferents from the sample matrix (sample cleanup). This high extraction efficiency has provided MS platforms with higher sensitivity.

Distinct CSF biomarker-associated DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects.,"Background Growing evidence has demonstrated that DNA methylation (DNAm) plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that DNAm differences can be detected in the blood of AD subjects. Most studies have correlated blood DNAm with the clinical diagnosis of AD in living individuals. However, as the pathophysiological process of AD can begin many years before the onset of clinical symptoms, there is often disagreement between neuropathology in the brain and clinical phenotypes. Therefore, blood DNAm associated with AD neuropathology, rather than with clinical data, would provide more relevant information on AD pathogenesis.

Contributions of blood-brain barrier imaging to neurovascular unit pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays important roles in the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Its main role includes three kinds of functions: (1) to protect the central nervous system from blood-borne toxins and pathogens; (2) to regulate the exchange of substances between the brain parenchyma and capillaries; and (3) to clear metabolic waste and other neurotoxic compounds from the central nervous system into meningeal lymphatics and systemic circulation. Physiologically, the BBB belongs to the glymphatic system and the intramural periarterial drainage pathway, both of which are involved in clearing interstitial solutes such as β-amyloid proteins. Thus, the BBB is believed to contribute to preventing the onset and progression for Alzheimer's disease. Measurements of BBB function are essential toward a better understanding of Alzheimer's pathophysiology to establish novel imaging biomarkers and open new avenues of interventions for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The visualization techniques for capillary, cerebrospinal, and interstitial fluid dynamics around the neurovascular unit in living human brains have been enthusiastically developed. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent BBB imaging developments using advanced magnetic resonance imaging technologies in relation to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. First, we give an overview of the relationship between Alzheimer's pathophysiology and BBB dysfunction. Second, we provide a brief description about the principles of non-contrast agent-based and contrast agent-based BBB imaging methodologies. Third, we summarize previous studies that have reported the findings of each BBB imaging method in individuals with the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Fourth, we introduce a wide range of Alzheimer's pathophysiology in relation to BBB imaging technologies to advance our understanding of the fluid dynamics around the BBB in both clinical and preclinical settings. Finally, we discuss the challenges of BBB imaging techniques and suggest future directions toward clinically useful imaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; MRI; biomarker; blood–brain barrier; neurovascular unit,,"Uchida, Y; Kan, H; Sakurai, K; Oishi, K; Matsukawa, N"
Effect of long-term antihypertensive treatment on cerebrovascular structure and function in hypertensive rats.,"Midlife hypertension is an important risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the effects of long-term treatment with two classes of antihypertensive drugs to determine whether diverging mechanisms of blood pressure lowering impact the brain differently. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were either left untreated or treated with a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) or beta blocker (atenolol) until one year of age. The normotensive Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY) was used as a reference group. Both drugs lowered blood pressure equally, while only atenolol decreased heart rate. Cerebrovascular resistance was increased in SHR, which was prevented by amlodipine but not atenolol. SHR showed a larger carotid artery diameter with impaired pulsatility, which was prevented by atenolol. Cerebral arteries demonstrated inward remodelling, stiffening and endothelial dysfunction in SHR. Both treatments similarly improved these parameters. MRI revealed that SHR have smaller brains with enlarged ventricles. In addition, neurofilament light levels were increased in cerebrospinal fluid of SHR. However, neither treatment affected these parameters. In conclusion, amlodipine and atenolol both lower blood pressure, but elicit a different hemodynamic profile. Both medications improve cerebral artery structure and function, but neither drug prevented indices of brain damage in this model of hypertension.",2023,,"Rats; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Hypertension; Rats, Inbred SHR; Atenolol; Amlodipine; Hypotension; Rats, Inbred WKY; Carotid Artery, Common","Naessens, DMP; de Vos, J; Richard, E; Wilhelmus, MMM; Jongenelen, CAM; Scholl, ER; van der Wel, NN; Heijst, JA; Teunissen, CE; Strijkers, GJ; Coolen, BF; VanBavel, E; Bakker, ENTP"
Retinal photoreceptor layer thickness has disease specificity and distinguishes predicted FTLD-Tau from biomarker-determined Alzheimer's disease.,"While Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with inner retina thinning (retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer), we have observed photoreceptor outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration tauopathy (FTLD-Tau) compared to normal controls. We hypothesized that ONL thinning may distinguish FTLD-Tau from patients with biomarker evidence of AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) and will correlate with FTLD-Tau disease severity. Predicted FTLD-Tau (pFTLD-Tau; n = 21; 33 eyes) and predicted ADNC (pADNC; n = 24; 46 eyes) patients were consecutively enrolled, underwent optical coherence tomography macula imaging, and disease was categorized (pFTLD-Tau vs. pADNC) with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, genetic testing, and autopsy data when available. Adjusting for age, sex, and race, pFTLD-Tau patients had a thinner ONL compared to pADNC, while retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer were not significantly different. Reduced ONL thickness correlated with worse performance on Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination and clinical dementia rating plus frontotemporal dementia sum of boxes for pFTLD-Tau but not pADNC. Photoreceptor ONL thickness may serve as an important noninvasive diagnostic marker that distinguishes FTLD-Tau from AD neuropathologic change.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Frontotemporal Dementia; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Tauopathies; Biomarkers; Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate; tau Proteins","Kim, BJ; Grossman, M; Aleman, TS; Song, D; Cousins, KAQ; McMillan, CT; Saludades, A; Yu, Y; Lee, EB; Wolk, D; Van Deerlin, VM; Shaw, LM; Ying, GS; Irwin, DJ"

Advanced Overview of Biomarkers and Techniques for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The development of early non-invasive diagnosis methods and identification of novel biomarkers are necessary for managing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and facilitating effective prognosis and treatment. AD has multi-factorial nature and involves complex molecular mechanism, which causes neuronal degeneration. The primary challenges in early AD detection include patient heterogeneity and lack of precise diagnosis at the preclinical stage. Several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarkers have been proposed to show excellent diagnosis ability by identifying tau pathology and cerebral amyloid beta (Aβ) for AD. Intense research endeavors are being made to develop ultrasensitive detection techniques and find potent biomarkers for early AD diagnosis. To mitigate AD worldwide, understanding various CSF biomarkers, blood biomarkers, and techniques that can be used for early diagnosis is imperative. This review attempts to provide information regarding AD pathophysiology, genetic and non-genetic factors associated with AD, several potential blood and CSF biomarkers, like neurofilament light, neurogranin, Aβ, and tau, along with biomarkers under development for AD detection. Besides, numerous techniques, such as neuroimaging, spectroscopic techniques, biosensors, and neuroproteomics, which are being explored to aid early AD detection, have been discussed. The insights thus gained would help in finding potential biomarkers and suitable techniques for the accurate diagnosis of early AD before cognitive dysfunction.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Blood biomarkers; Cerebrospinal fluid; Diagnosis,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Early Diagnosis; Biomarkers,"Rani, S; Dhar, SB; Khajuria, A; Gupta, D; Jaiswal, PK; Singla, N; Kaur, M; Singh, G; Barnwal, RP"

Comparison of Retinal Structural and Neurovascular Changes between Patients with and without Amyloid Pathology.,"To evaluate whether an impaired anterior visual pathway (retinal structures with microvasculature) is associated with underlying beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathologies in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we compared retinal structural and vascular factors in each subgroup with positive or negative amyloid biomarkers. Twenty-seven patients with dementia, thirty-five with MCI, and nine with cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls were consecutively recruited. All participants were divided into positive Aβ (A+) or negative Aβ (A-) pathology based on amyloid positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid Aβ. The retinal circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT), macular ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer thickness (mGC/IPLT), and microcirculation of the macular superficial capillary plexus were measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography. One eye of each participant was included in the analysis. Retinal structural and vascular factors significantly decreased in the following order: dementia < MCI < CU controls. The A+ group had significantly lower microcirculation in the para- and peri-foveal temporal regions than did the A-. However, the structural and vascular parameters did not differ between the A+ and A- with dementia. The cpRNFLT was unexpectedly greater in the A+ than in the A- with MCI. mGC/IPLT was lower in the A+ CU than in the A- CU. Our findings suggest that retinal structural changes may occur in the preclinical and early stages of dementia but are not highly specific to AD pathophysiology. In contrast, decreased temporal macula microcirculation may be used as a biomarker for the underlying Aβ pathology.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ pathology; optical coherence tomographic angiography,,"Moon, S; Jeon, S; Seo, SK; Kim, DE; Jung, NY; Kim, SJ; Lee, MJ; Lee, J; Kim, EJ"

Review of Technological Challenges in Personalised Medicine and Early Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by progressive neuron loss in specific brain areas. The most common are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; in both cases, diagnosis is based on clinical tests with limited capability to discriminate between similar neurodegenerative disorders and detect the early stages of the disease. It is common that by the time a patient is diagnosed with the disease, the level of neurodegeneration is already severe. Thus, it is critical to find new diagnostic methods that allow earlier and more accurate disease detection. This study reviews the methods available for the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and potentially interesting new technologies. Neuroimaging techniques are the most widely used in clinical practice, and new techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have significantly improved the diagnosis quality. Identifying biomarkers in peripheral samples such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid is a major focus of the current research on neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery of good markers could allow preventive screening to identify early or asymptomatic stages of the neurodegenerative process. These methods, in combination with artificial intelligence, could contribute to the generation of predictive models that will help clinicians in the early diagnosis, stratification, and prognostic assessment of patients, leading to improvements in patient treatment and quality of life.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; alpha-synuclein; beta-amyloid; biomarker; exosomes; imaging techniques; neuroinflammation; reactive antibodies,Humans; Precision Medicine; Artificial Intelligence; Quality of Life; Alzheimer Disease; Early Diagnosis; Biomarkers,"Domínguez-Fernández, C; Egiguren-Ortiz, J; Razquin, J; Gómez-Galán, M; De Las Heras-García, L; Paredes-Rodríguez, E; Astigarraga, E; Miguélez, C; Barreda-Gómez, G"

TDP-43 Proteinopathy Specific Biomarker Development.,"TDP-43 is the primary or secondary pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, half of frontotemporal dementia cases, and limbic age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, which clinically resembles Alzheimer's dementia. In such diseases, a biomarker that can detect TDP-43 proteinopathy in life would help to stratify patients according to their definite diagnosis of pathology, rather than in clinical subgroups of uncertain pathology. For therapies developed to target pathological proteins that cause the disease a biomarker to detect and track the underlying pathology would greatly enhance such undertakings.

Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: Involvement of the choroid plexus.,"The choroid plexus (ChP) produces and is bathed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows extensive proteomic alterations including evidence of inflammation. Considering inflammation hampers functions of the involved tissues, the CSF abnormalities reported in these conditions are suggestive of ChP injury. Indeed, several studies document ChP damage in aging and AD, which nevertheless remains to be systematically characterized. We here report that the changes elicited in the CSF by AD are consistent with a perturbed aging process and accompanied by aberrant accumulation of inflammatory signals and metabolically active proteins in the ChP. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging shows that these molecular aberrancies correspond to significant remodeling of ChP in AD, which correlates with aging and cognitive decline. Collectively, our preliminary post-mortem and in vivo findings reveal a repertoire of ChP pathologies indicative of its dysfunction and involvement in the pathogenesis of AD.

"Predicting Brain Amyloid Positivity from T1 weighted brain MRI and MRI-derived Gray Matter, White Matter and CSF maps using Transfer Learning on 3D CNNs.","Abnormal β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease and practical tests could help identify patients who could respond to treatment, now that promising anti-amyloid drugs are available. Even so, Aβ positivity (Aβ+) is assessed using PET or CSF assays, both highly invasive procedures. Here, we investigate how well Aβ+ can be predicted from T1 weighted brain MRI and gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid segmentations from T1-weighted brain MRI (T1w), a less invasive alternative. We used 3D convolutional neural networks to predict Aβ+ based on 3D brain MRI data, from 762 elderly subjects (mean age: 75.1 yrs. ± 7.6SD; 394F/368M; 459 healthy controls, 67 with MCI and 236 with dementia) scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We also tested whether the accuracy increases when using transfer learning from the larger UK Biobank dataset. Overall, the 3D CNN predicted Aβ+ with 76% balanced accuracy from T1w scans. The closest performance to this was using white matter maps alone when the model was pre-trained on an age prediction in the UK Biobank. The performance of individual tissue maps was less than the T1w, but transfer learning helped increase the accuracy. Although tests on more diverse data are warranted, deep learned models from standard MRI show initial promise for Aβ+ estimation, before considering more invasive procedures.",2023,,,"Chattopadhyay, T; Ozarkar, SS; Buwa, K; Thomopoulos, SI; Thompson, PM"

Nasu-Hakola Disease With Stroke-like Attack: A Case Report.,"Homozygous mutations in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene are known to cause Nasu-Hakola disease, which is a rare cause of progressive presenile dementia. A 36-year-old woman presented with repetitive seizures, a 5-year history of progressive behavioral and cognitive changes, and an affected sibling. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an ischemic lesion in the left medial temporal lobe. Extensive evaluation of juvenile stroke revealed that viral and autoimmune encephalitides, serum lactate and pyruvate levels, and cerebrospinal fluid composition were all normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was notable of thinning of the corpus callosum and caudate and frontotemporal cortical atrophy, in addition to the ischemic lesion. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation (c.A257T; p.D86V) in TREM2. The present case expands the clinical phenotype of Nasu-Hakola disease and further suggests that TREM2 pathway might have role in vessel wall health.",2023,,Humans; Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis; Brain; Lipodystrophy; Stroke,"Rashid Nezhad, A; Olfati, N; Shoeibi, A; Rezaei Talab, F; Soltani Sabi, M"

Moxibustion improves hypothalamus ,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is highly polarized to perivascular astrocytic endfeet. Loss of AQP4 polarization is associated with many diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), AQP4 loses its normal location and thus reduces the clearance of amyloid-β plaques and tau protein. Clinical and experimental studies showed that moxibustion can improve the learning and memory abilities of AD. To explore whether moxibustion can affect the polarization of AQP4 around the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to analyze the expression and polarization of ",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aquaporin-4; hypothalamus; mitochondrial respiratory chain; moxibustion; spatial transcriptomics,,"Liu, S; Li, H; Shen, Y; Zhu, W; Wang, Y; Wang, J; Zhang, N; Li, C; Xie, L; Wu, Q"

Effect of a dual orexin receptor antagonist on Alzheimer's disease: Sleep disorders and cognition.,"Orexin is a neuropeptide produced by the lateral hypothalamus that plays an important role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. The overexpression of the orexinergic system may be related to the pathology of sleep/wakefulness disorders in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD patients, the increase in cerebrospinal fluid orexin levels is associated with parallel sleep deterioration. Dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) can not only treat the sleep-wakefulness disorder of AD but also improve the performance of patients with cognitive behavior disorder. It is critical to clarify the role of the orexin system in AD, study its relationship with cognitive decline in AD, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of DORA.",2022,Alzheimer's disease; cognition; insomnia; orexin; treatment,,"Zhou, M; Tang, S"

Levels of Soluble Interleukin 6 Receptor and Asp358Ala Are Associated With Cognitive Performance and Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease process manifesting clinically with cognitive impairment and dementia. AD pathology is complex, and in addition to plaques and tangles, neuroinflammation is a consistent feature. Interleukin (IL) 6 is a multifaceted cytokine involved in a plethora of cellular mechanisms including both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory processes. IL6 can signal classically through the membrane-bound receptor or by IL6 trans-signaling forming a complex with the soluble IL6 receptor (sIL6R) and activating membrane-bound glycoprotein 130 on cells not expressing IL6R.

TREM2 splice isoforms generate soluble TREM2 species that disrupt long-term potentiation.,"TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor expressed by myeloid cells and acts to regulate their immune response. TREM2 governs the response of microglia to amyloid and tau pathologies in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. TREM2 is also present in a soluble form (sTREM2), and its CSF levels fluctuate as a function of AD progression. Analysis of stroke and AD mouse models revealed that sTREM2 proteins bind to neurons, which suggests sTREM2 may act in a non-cell autonomous manner to influence neuronal function. sTREM2 arises from the proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-associated receptor. However, alternatively spliced TREM2 species lacking a transmembrane domain have been postulated to contribute to the pool of sTREM2.

Treatment with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Reduces Viral Titers in the Brains of West Nile Virus-Infected Mice and Improves Survival.,"West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of epidemic arboviral encephalitis in the United States. As there are currently no proven antiviral therapies or licensed human vaccines, understanding the neuropathogenesis of WNV is critical for rational therapeutic design. In WNV-infected mice, the depletion of microglia leads to enhanced viral replication, increased central nervous system (CNS) tissue injury, and increased mortality, suggesting that microglia play a critical role in protection against WNV neuroinvasive disease. To determine if augmenting microglial activation would provide a potential therapeutic strategy, we administered granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to WNV-infected mice. Recombinant human GM-CSF (rHuGMCSF) (sargramostim [Leukine]) is an FDA-approved drug used to increase white blood cells following leukopenia-inducing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. Daily treatment of both uninfected and WNV-infected mice with subcutaneous injections of GM-CSF resulted in microglial proliferation and activation as indicated by the enhanced expression of the microglia activation marker ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and several microglia-associated inflammatory cytokines, including CCL2 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-10. In addition, more microglia adopted an activated morphology as demonstrated by increased sizes and more pronounced processes. GM-CSF-induced microglial activation in WNV-infected mice was associated with reduced viral titers and apoptotic activity (caspase 3) in the brains of WNV-infected mice and significantly increased survival.

Blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker changes in patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment treated with lithium: analysis from a randomised placebo-controlled trial.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, ART does not completely halt or reverse the pathological processes behind HAND. Adjuvant mitigating treatments are, therefore, prudent. Lithium treatment is known to promote neuronal brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF). Lithium is also an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3-β). We analyzed biomarkers obtained from participants in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of lithium in ART-treated individuals with moderate or severe HAND. We assayed markers at baseline and 24 weeks across several pathways hypothesized to be affected by HIV, inflammation, or degeneration. Investigated biomarkers included dopamine, BDNF, neurofilament light chain, and CD8 + lymphocyte activation (CD38 + HLADR +). Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers included soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha and beta (sAPPα/β), Aβ38, 40, 42, and ten other biomarkers validated as predictors of mild cognitive impairment and progression in previous studies. These include apolipoprotein C3, pre-albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α1-antitrypsin, PEDF, CC4, ICAM-1, RANTES, clusterin, and cystatin c. We recruited 61 participants (placebo = 31; lithium = 30). The age baseline mean was 40 (± 8.35) years and the median CD4 + T-cell count was 498 (IQR: 389-651) cells/μL. Biomarker concentrations between groups did not differ at baseline. However, both groups' blood dopamine levels decreased significantly after 24 weeks (adj. p < 002). No other marker was significantly different between groups, and we concluded that lithium did not confer neuroprotection following 24 weeks of treatment.

Plasma extracellular vesicles reveal early molecular differences in amyloid positive patients with early-onset mild cognitive impairment.,"In the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) development, the dementia phase is commonly preceded by a prodromal AD phase, which is mainly characterized by reaching the highest levels of Aβ and p-tau-mediated neuronal injury and a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) clinical status. Because of that, most AD cases are diagnosed when neuronal damage is already established and irreversible. Therefore, a differential diagnosis of MCI causes in these prodromal stages is one of the greatest challenges for clinicians. Blood biomarkers are emerging as desirable tools for pre-screening purposes, but the current results are still being analyzed and much more data is needed to be implemented in clinical practice. Because of that, plasma extracellular vesicles (pEVs) are gaining popularity as a new source of biomarkers for the early stages of AD development. To identify an exosome proteomics signature linked to prodromal AD, we performed a cross-sectional study in a cohort of early-onset MCI (EOMCI) patients in which 184 biomarkers were measured in pEVs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma samples using multiplex PEA technology of Olink",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Extracellular vesicles; Mild cognitive impairment; Plasma exosomes; Proteomics,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cross-Sectional Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Cano, A; Esteban-de-Antonio, E; Bernuz, M; Puerta, R; García-González, P; de Rojas, I; Olivé, C; Pérez-Cordón, A; Montrreal, L; Núñez-Llaves, R; Sotolongo-Grau, Ó; Alarcón-Martín, E; Valero, S; Alegret, M; Martín, E; Martino-Adami, PV; Ettcheto, M; Camins, A; Vivas, A; Gomez-Chiari, M; Tejero, MÁ; Orellana, A; Tárraga, L; Marquié, M; Ramírez, A; Martí, M; Pividori, MI; Boada, M; Ruíz, A"

APOE differentially moderates cerebrospinal fluid and plasma phosphorylated tau181 associations with multi-domain cognition.,"Biofluid markers of phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) are increasingly popular for the detection of early Alzheimer's pathologic changes. However, the differential dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma p-tau181 remain under investigation. We studied 727 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with plasma and CSF p-tau181 data, apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 carrier status, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and neuropsychological data. Higher levels of plasma and CSF p-tau181 were observed among APOE ε4 carriers. CSF and plasma p-tau181 were significantly associated with memory, and this effect was greater in APOE ε4 carriers. However, whereas CSF p-tau181 was not significantly associated with language or attention/executive function among ε4 carriers or non-carriers, APOE ε4 status moderated the association of plasma p-tau181 with both language and attention/executive function. These findings lend support to the notion that p-tau181 biofluid markers are useful in measuring AD pathologic changes but also suggest that CSF and plasma p-tau181 have unique properties and dynamics that should be considered when using these markers in research and clinical practice.",2023,Apolipoprotein E; Cerebrospinal fluid; Cognition; Phosphorylated tau; Plasma,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E4; Biomarkers; Cognition; tau Proteins,"Weigand, AJ; Ortiz, G; Walker, KS; Galasko, DR; Bondi, MW; Thomas, KR"
27-hydroxycholesterol promotes oligodendrocyte maturation: Implications for hypercholesterolemia-associated brain white matter changes.,"Oxidized cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) is a potential link between hypercholesterolemia and neurodegenerative diseases since unlike peripheral cholesterol, 27-OH is transported across the blood-brain barrier.

We hypothesize that during hypercholesterolemia 27-OH may impact oligodendrocytes and myelin and thus contribute to the disconnection of neural networks in neurodegenerative diseases.

We describe a case of a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patient with biomarker evidence for amyloidosis, tau, and neurodegeneration who had minimal changes in clinical phenotype during an 11-year period. AD biomarkers were obtained with cerebrospinal fluid analysis and amyloid PET imaging, both of which supported a biological diagnosis of AD. However, the patient's neuropsychological profile remained stable over 11 years except for mild memory-retrieval changes.

miRNAs and Alzheimer's Disease: Exploring the Role of Inflammation and Vitamin E in an Old-Age Population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia worldwide and represents one of the leading factors for severe disability in older persons. Although its etiology is not fully known yet, AD may develop due to multiple factors, including inflammation and oxidative stress, conditions where microRNAs (miRNAs) seem to play a pivotal role as a molecular switch. All these aspects may be modulated by nutritional factors. Among them, vitamin E has been widely studied in AD, given the plausibility of its various biological functions in influencing neurodegeneration. From a cohort of old-aged people, we measured eight vitamin E forms (tocopherols and tocotrienols), thirty cytokines/chemokines, and thirteen exosome-extracted miRNAs in plasma of subjects suffering from subjects affected by AD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). The sample population included 80 subjects (40 AD and 40 HC) with a mean age of 77.6 ± 3.8 years, mostly women (45; 56.2%). Of the vitamin E forms, only α-tocopherol differed between groups, with significantly lower levels in AD. Regarding the examined inflammatory molecules, G-CSF, GM-CSF, INF-α2, IL-3, and IL-8 were significantly higher and IL-17 lower in AD than HC. Among all miRNAs examined, AD showed downregulation of miR-9, miR-21, miR29-b, miR-122, and miR-132 compared to controls. MiR-122 positively and significantly correlated with some inflammatory molecules (GM-CSF, INF-α2, IL-1α, IL-8, and MIP-1β) as well as with α-tocopherol even after correction for age and gender. A final binary logistic regression analysis showed that α-tocopherol serum levels were associated with a higher AD probability and partially mediated by miR-122. Our results suggest an interplay between α-tocopherol, inflammatory molecules, and microRNAs in AD, where miR-122 may be a good candidate as modulating factor.",2023,aging; inflammation; miRNAs; oxidative stress; vitamin E,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; alpha-Tocopherol; Alzheimer Disease; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Inflammation; Interleukin-8; MicroRNAs; Vitamin E","Boccardi, V; Poli, G; Cecchetti, R; Bastiani, P; Scamosci, M; Febo, M; Mazzon, E; Bruscoli, S; Brancorsini, S; Mecocci, P"
Role of Nanomedicine-Based Therapeutics in the Treatment of CNS Disorders.,"Central nervous system disorders, especially neurodegenerative diseases, are a public health priority and demand a strong scientific response. Various therapy procedures have been used in the past, but their therapeutic value has been insufficient. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier is two of the barriers that protect the central nervous system (CNS), but are the main barriers to medicine delivery into the CNS for treating CNS disorders, such as brain tumors, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Nanotechnology-based medicinal approaches deliver valuable cargos targeting molecular and cellular processes with greater safety, efficacy, and specificity than traditional approaches. CNS diseases include a wide range of brain ailments connected to short- and long-term disability. They affect millions of people worldwide and are anticipated to become more common in the coming years. Nanotechnology-based brain therapy could solve the BBB problem.

BMP4-SMAD1/5/9-RUNX2 pathway activation inhibits neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in Alzheimer's patients' iPSCs in senescence-related conditions.,"In addition to increasing β-amyloid plaque deposition and tau tangle formation, inhibition of neurogenesis has recently been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study generated a cellular model that recapitulated neurogenesis defects observed in patients with AD, using induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from sporadic and familial AD (AD iPSCs). AD iPSCs exhibited impaired neuron and oligodendrocyte generation when expression of several senescence markers was induced. Compound screening using these cellular models identified three drugs able to restore neurogenesis, and extensive morphological quantification revealed cell-line- and drug-type-dependent neuronal generation. We also found involvement of elevated Sma- and Mad-related protein 1/5/9 (SMAD1/5/9) phosphorylation and greater Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression in neurogenesis defects in AD.

Four-dimensional proteomics analysis of human cerebrospinal fluid with trapped ion mobility spectrometry using PASEF.,"A quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with a trapped ion mobility spectrometry (timsTOF) operated in parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) mode has recently emerged as a platform capable of providing four-dimensional (4D) features comprising of elution time, collision cross section (CCS), mass-to-charge ratio, and intensity of peptides. The PASEF mode provides ∼100% ion sampling efficiency both in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) modes without sacrificing sensitivity. In addition, targeted measurements using PASEF integrated parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode have also been described. However, only limited number of studies have used timsTOF for analysis of clinical samples. Although Orbitrap mass spectrometers have been used for biomarker discovery from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a variety of neurological diseases, these Orbitrap-derived datasets cannot readily be applied for driving experiments on timsTOF mass spectrometers. We generated a catalog of peptides and proteins in human CSF in DDA mode on a timsTOF mass spectrometer and used these data to build a spectral library. This strategy allowed us to use elution times and ion mobility values from the spectral library to design PRM experiments for quantifying previously discovered biomarkers from CSF samples in Alzheimer's disease. When the same samples were analyzed using a DIA approach combined with a spectral library search, a higher number of proteins were identified than in a library-free approach. Overall, we have established a spectral library of CSF as a resource and demonstrated its utility for PRM and DIA studies, which should facilitate studies of neurological disorders.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; CSF; DDA-PASEF; diaPASEF; prm-PASEF,Humans; Proteomics; Ion Mobility Spectrometry; Peptides; Mass Spectrometry; Proteins,"Mun, DG; Budhraja, R; Bhat, FA; Zenka, RM; Johnson, KL; Moghekar, A; Pandey, A"
Inhibiting tau protein improves the recovery of spinal cord injury in rats by alleviating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.,"After spinal cord injury, the concentrations of total and hyperphosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid increase, and levels of both correlate with injury severity. Tau inhibition is considered effective therapy for many central nervous system diseases, including traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease. However, whether it can play a role in the treatment of spinal cord injury remains unclear. In this study, the therapeutic effects of tau inhibition were investigated in a rat model of transection spinal cord injury by injecting the rats with a lentivirus encoding tau siRNA that inhibits tau expression. We found that tau inhibition after spinal cord injury down-regulated the levels of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β. It also led to a shift of activated microglial polarization from the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype to the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype, and reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species in the acute phase. Furthermore, the survival of residual neural cells around the injury epicenter, and neuronal and axonal regeneration were also markedly enhanced, which promoted locomotor recovery in the model rats. Collectively, our findings support the conclusion that tau inhibition can attenuate neuroinflammation, alleviate oxidative stress, protect residual cells, facilitate neurogenesis, and improve the functional recovery after spinal cord injury, and thus suggest that tau could be a good molecular target for spinal cord injury therapy.",2023,MAPK pathway; functional recovery; microglial polarization; neuroinflammation; neuronal regeneration; oxidative stress; spinal cord injury; tau,,"Chen, GL; Sun, K; Liu, XZ; Tong, KL; Chen, ZJ; Yu, L; Chen, NN; Liu, SY"
"Alzheimer's disease with sleep insufficiency: a cross-sectional study on correlations among clinical characteristics, orexin, its receptors, and the blood-brain barrier.","Previous studies have shown that reduced sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and decreased sleep quality in patients with Alzheimer's disease are related to dysfunction in orexin signaling. At the same time, blood-brain barrier disruption is considered an early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. However, currently no report has examined how changes in orexin signaling relate to changes in the blood-brain barrier of patients who have Alzheimer's disease with sleep insufficiency. This cross-sectional study included 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease who received treatment in 2019 at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups: those with insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤ 6 hours, n = 19, age 61.58 ± 8.54 years, 10 men) and those with normal sleep durations (sleep duration > 6 hours, n = 31, age 63.19 ± 10.09 years, 18 men). Demographic variables were collected to evaluate cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living. The levels of orexin, its receptor proteins, and several blood-brain barrier factors were measured in cerebrospinal fluid. Sleep insufficiency was associated with impaired overall cognitive function that spanned multiple cognitive domains. Furthermore, levels of orexin and its receptors were upregulated in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the blood-brain barrier was destroyed. Both these events precipitated each other and accelerated the progression of Alzheimer's disease. These findings describe the clinical characteristics and potential mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease accompanied by sleep deprivation. Inhibiting the upregulation of elements within the orexin system or preventing the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier could thus be targets for treating Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood-brain barrier; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical characteristics; cognitive function; matrix metalloproteinase-3; matrix metalloproteinases; neuropsychiatric symptoms; orexin signaling; sleep insufficiency,,"Guo, P; Zhang, WJ; Lian, TH; Zhang, WJ; He, MY; Zhang, YN; Huang, Y; Ding, DY; Guan, HY; Li, JH; Li, DN; Luo, DM; Zhang, WJ; Yue, H; Wang, XM; Zhang, W"

Structural Proteomic Profiling of Cerebrospinal Fluids to Reveal Novel Conformational Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common representation of dementia, with brain pathological hallmarks of protein abnormal aggregation, such as with amyloid beta and tau protein. It is well established that posttranslational modifications on tau protein, particularly phosphorylation, increase the likelihood of its aggregation and subsequent formation of neurofibrillary tangles, another hallmark of AD. As additional misfolded proteins presumably exist distinctly in AD disease states, which would serve as potential source of AD biomarkers, we used limited proteolysis-coupled with mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) to probe protein structural changes. After optimizing the LiP-MS conditions, we further applied this method to human cerebrospinal fluid specimens collected from healthy control, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD subject groups to characterize proteome-wide misfolding tendencies as a result of disease progression. The fully tryptic peptides embedding LiP sites were compared with the half-tryptic peptides generated from internal cleavage of the same region to determine any structural unfolding or misfolding. We discovered hundreds of significantly up- and down-regulated peptides associated with MCI and AD indicating their potential structural changes in AD progression. Moreover, we detected 53 structurally changed regions in 12 proteins with high confidence between the healthy control and disease groups, illustrating the functional relevance of these proteins with AD progression. These newly discovered conformational biomarker candidates establish valuable future directions for exploring the molecular mechanism of designing therapeutic targets for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; LiP-MS; conformational biomarker; limited proteolysis; proteomics; structural mass spectrometry,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Proteomics; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Wang, B; Zhong, X; Fields, L; Lu, H; Zhu, Z; Li, L"

"Soluble TREM2, Alzheimer's Disease Pathology, and Risk for Progression of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: A Longitudinal Study.","BackgroundUntil recently, studies on associations between neuroinflammation in vivo and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) are scarce. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a candidate biomarker of microglial activation and neuroinflammation, were found elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but they have not been fully explored in CSVD.ObjectiveTo determine whether CSF sTREM2 levels are associated with the increased risk of CSVD progression.MethodsA total of 426 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were included in this study. All participants underwent measurements of CSF sTREM2 and AD pathology (Aβ1-42, P-tau181P). The progression of CSVD burden and imaging markers, including cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), white matter hyperintensities and lacunes, were estimated based on neuroimaging changes. Logistic regression and moderation effect models were applied to explore associations of sTREM2 with CSVD progression and AD pathology.Results Higher CSF sTREM2 levels at baseline were associated with increased CSVD burden (OR = 1.28 [95% CI, 1.01-1.62]) and CMBs counts (OR = 1.32 [95% CI, 1.03-1.68]). Similarly, increased change rates of CSF sTREM2 might predict elevated CMBs counts (OR = 1.44 [95% CI, 1.05-1.98]). Participants with AD pathology (Aβ1-42 and P-tau181P) showed a stronger association between CSF sTREM2 and CSVD progression.ConclusionThis longitudinal study found a positive association between CSF sTREM2 and CSVD progression, suggesting that neuroinflammation might promote CSVD. Furthermore, neuroinflammation could be a shared pathogenesis of CSVD and AD at the early stage.

A Case of Reversible Dementia? Dementia vs Delirium in Lyme Disease.,"Lyme disease is an uncommon cause of reversible dementia. A 75-year-old male patient, with a personal history of mild memory deficit, was admitted to Alzheimer's Disease Care Unit due to hallucinations, confusion and aggressive behavior unresponsive to antipsychotic therapy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was negative, while blood exams showed a rise in inflammatory parameters. A complete screening of infective diseases showed a positive serology for Borrelia burgdorferi, confirmed at Western blot. Even though the patient refused cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exam, the brilliant clinical improvement after the appropriate antimicrobial therapy is strongly suggestive for a diagnosis of neuroborreliosis.

Comparison of Machine Learning-based Approaches to Predict the Conversion to Alzheimer's Disease from Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"In Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), identifying a high risk of conversion to Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (AD) is a primary goal for patient management. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely employed to pursue data-driven diagnostic and prognostic goals. An agreement on the stability of these algorithms -when applied to different biomarkers and other conditions- is far from being reached. In this study, we compared the different prognostic performances of three supervised ML algorithms fed with multimodal biomarkers of MCI subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithms predict MCI conversion to AD. They can also be simultaneously employed -with the voting procedure- to improve predictivity. AD prediction accuracy is influenced by the nature of the data (i.e., neuropsychological test scores, cerebrospinal fluid AD-related proteins and APOE ε4, cerebral structural MRI (sMRI) data). In our study, independent of the applied ML algorithms, sMRI data showed the lowest accuracy (0.79) compared to other classes. Multimodal data were helpful in the algorithms' performances by combining clinical and biological measures. Accordingly, using the three ML algorithms, the highest accuracy (0.90) was reached by employing neuropsychological and AD-related biomarkers. Finally, the feature selection procedure indicated that the most critical variables in the respective classes were the ADAS-Cog-13 scale, the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus atrophy, and the ratio between phosphorylated Tau and Aβ42 proteins. In conclusion, our data support the notion that using multiple ML algorithms and multimodal biomarkers helps make more accurate and solid predictions.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD) prediction; artificial intelligence; gradient boosting; machine learning (ML) algorithms; mild cognitive impairment (MCI); random forest (RF),Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression; Cognitive Dysfunction; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biomarkers,"Franciotti, R; Nardini, D; Russo, M; Onofrj, M; Sensi, SL"

Heteromultivalent scaffolds fabricated by biomimetic co-assembly of DNA-RNA building blocks for the multi-analysis of miRNAs.,"Heteromultivalent scaffolds with different repeated monomers have great potential in biomedicine, but convenient construction strategies for integrating various functional modules to achieve multiple biological functions are still lacking. Here, taking advantage of the heteromultivalent effect of dendritic nucleic acids and the specific biochemical properties of microRNAs (miRNAs), we assembled novel heteromultivalent nucleic acid scaffolds by biomimetic co-assembly of DNA-RNA building blocks. In our approach, two miRNAs were used to initiate and maintain dendritic structures in an interdependent manner; so, the heteromultivalent nanostructure can only form in the presence of both miRNAs. The proposed nanostructure can be used for one-step analysis of two miRNAs in an AND logic format. Taking miR-18b-5p and miR-342-3p which are associated with Alzheimer's disease as an example, a FRET sensing system was fabricated for the simultaneous analysis of two miRNAs within one hour at picomolar concentration. Further studies show that the designed device may have the potential to distinguish between AD patients and the healthy population by analysis of two miRNAs in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) samples, suggesting its possible applicability in clinics.",2023,,Humans; MicroRNAs; Biomimetics; Gene Expression Profiling; Alzheimer Disease; DNA,"Duan, C; Chen, Y; Hou, Z; Li, D; Jiao, J; Sun, W; Xiang, Y"

Behavioral and cognitive performance of humanized APOEε3/ε3 liver mice in relation to plasma apolipoprotein E levels.,"Plasma apolipoprotein E levels were previously associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), levels of cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, cognition and imaging brain measures. Outside the brain, the liver is the primary source of apoE and liver transplantation studies have demonstrated that liver-derived apoE does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. How hepatic apoE may be implicated in behavioral and cognitive performance is not clear. In the current study, we behaviorally tested FRGN mice with humanized liver harboring the ε3/ε3 genotype (E3-human liver (HL)) and compared their behavioral and cognitive performance with that of age-matched ε3/ε3 targeted replacement (E3-TR) mice, the latter produces human apoE3 throughout the body whereas the E3-HL mice endogenously produce human apoE3 only in the liver. We also compared the liver weights and plasma apoE levels, and assessed whether plasma apoE levels were correlated with behavioral or cognitive measures in both models. E3-HL were more active but performed cognitively worse than E3-TR mice. E3-HL mice moved more in the open field containing objects, showed higher activity levels in the Y maze, showed higher activity levels during the baseline period in the fear conditioning test than E3-TR mice, and swam faster than E3-TR mice during training to locate the visible platform in the water maze. However, E3-HL mice showed reduced spatial memory retention in the water maze and reduced fear learning and contextual and cued fear memory than E3-TR mice. Liver weights were greater in E3-HL than E3-TR mice and sex-dependent only in the latter model. Plasma apoE3 levels were similar to those found in humans and comparable in female and male E3-TR mice but higher in female E3-HL mice. Finally, we found correlations between plasma apoE levels and behavioral and cognitive measures which were predominantly model-dependent. Our study demonstrates mouse-model dependent associations between plasma apoE levels, behavior and cognition in an 'AD-neutral' setting and suggests that a humanized liver might be sufficient to induce mouse behavioral and cognitive phenotypes.",2023,,Female; Male; Animals; Humans; Mice; Apolipoprotein E3; Liver; Apolipoproteins E; Cognition; Brain; Alzheimer Disease,"Kessler, K; Giannisis, A; Bial, G; Foquet, L; Nielsen, HM; Raber, J"
A Quantitative LC-MS/MS Method for Distinguishing the Tau Protein Forms Phosphorylated and Nonphosphorylated at Serine-396.,"Hyperphosphorylated tau protein is well-known to be involved in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and the progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases (tauopathies), including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Tau protein phosphorylated at serine-396 (pS396-tau) is often linked to disease progression, and we therefore developed an analytical method to measure pS396-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in humans and animal models of AD. In the S396-region, multiple phosphorylation sites are present, causing structural complexity and sensitivity challenges for conventional bottom-up mass spectrometry approaches. Here, we present an indirect LC-MS/MS method for quantification of pS396-tau. We take advantage of the reproducible miscleavage caused by S396 being preceded by a lysine (K395) and the proteolytic enzyme trypsin not cleaving when the following amino acid is phosphorylated. Therefore, treatment with trypsin discriminates between the forms of tau with and without phosphorylation at S396 and pS396-tau can be quantified as the difference between total S396-tau and nonphosphorylated S396-tau. To qualify the method, it was successfully applied for quantification of pS396-tau in human CSF from healthy controls and patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD. In addition, the method was applied for rTg4510 mice where a clear dose dependent decrease in pS396-tau was observed in CSF following intravenous administration of a monoclonal antibody (Lu AF87908, hC10.2) targeting the tau epitope containing pS396. Finally, a formal validation of the method was conducted. In conclusion, this sensitive LC-MS/MS-based method for measurement of pS396-tau in CSF allows for quantitative translational biomarker applications for tauopathies including investigations of potential drug induced effects.",2023,,"Animals; Humans; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Chromatography, Liquid; Phosphorylation; Serine; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Trypsin","Jacobsen, AM; van de Merbel, NC; Ditlevsen, DK; Tvermosegaard, K; Schalk, F; Lambert, W; Bundgaard, C; Pedersen, JT; Rosenqvist, N"

BACE1 influences clinical manifestations and central inflammation in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.,"Neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes influence the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS). The β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has been associated with cognitive dysfunction, amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. We explored in a group of 50 patients with relapsing-remitting MS the association between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of BACE1, clinical characteristics at the time of diagnosis and prospective disability after three-years follow-up. In addition, we assessed the correlations between the CSF levels of BACE 1, amyloid β (Aβ) 1-40 and 1-42, phosphorylated tau (pTau), lactate, and a set of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules. BACE1 CSF levels were correlated positively with depression as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition scale, and negatively with visuospatial memory performance evaluated by the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised. In addition, BACE CSF levels were positively correlated with Bayesian Risk Estimate for MS at onset, and with Expanded Disability Status Scale score assessed three years after diagnosis. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between BACE1, amyloid β 42/40 ratio (Spearman's r = 0.334, p = 0.018, n = 50), pTau (Spearman's r = 0.304, p = 0.032, n = 50) and lactate concentrations (Spearman's r = 0.361, p = 0.01, n = 50). Finally, an association emerged between BACE1 CSF levels and a group of pro and anti-inflammatory molecules, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-17, IL-13, IL-9 and interferon-γ.

"Type-2 Diabetes, Pancreatic Amylin, and Neuronal Metabolic Remodeling in Alzheimer's Disease.","Type-2 diabetes raises the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia and the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, yet mechanisms connecting type-2 diabetes to AD remain largely unknown. Amylin, a pancreatic β-cell hormone co-secreted with insulin, participates in the central regulation of satiation, but also forms pancreatic amyloid in persons with type-2 diabetes and synergistically interacts with brain amyloid β (Aβ) pathology, in both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidence from studies of tumor growth, together with early observations in skeletal muscle, indicates amylin as a potential trigger of cellular metabolic reprogramming. Because the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain parenchyma in humans with AD have increased concentrations of amylin, amylin-mediated pathological processes in the brain may involve neuronal metabolic remodeling. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding the link between prediabetic hypersecretion of amylin and risk of neuronal metabolic remodeling and AD and suggests nutritional and medical effects of food constituents that might prevent and/or ameliorate amylin-mediated neuronal metabolic remodeling.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; amylin; diabetes; metabolism; vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID),,"Leibold, N; Bain, JR; Despa, F"

Assessing the role of primary healthy microglia and gap junction blocker in hindering Alzheimer's disease neuroinflammatory type: Early approaches for therapeutic intervention.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a predominantly heterogeneous disease with a highly complex pathobiology. The presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) depositions and the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein remain the characteristic hallmarks of AD. These hallmarks can be detected throughout the brain and other regions, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the spinal cord. Microglia cells, the brain-resident macrophage type of the brain, are implicated in maintaining healthy brain homeostasis. The localized administration of primary healthy microglia (PHM) is suggested to play a role in mitigating AD hallmark depositions and associated cognitive dysfunction. Carbenoxolone (CBX) is the most common gap junction blocker. It cannot effectively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under systemic administration. Therefore, localized administration of CBX may be a recommended intervention against AD by acting as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. This study aims to determine whether the localized intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of PHM and CBX may act as an effective therapeutic intervention for AD neuroinflammatory type. In addition, this study also aims to reveal whether detecting AD hallmarks in the spinal cord and CSF can be considered functional and effective during AD early diagnosis. Male albino rats were divided into four groups: control (group 1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AD neuroinflammatory type (group 2), ICV injection of LPS + isolated PHM (group 3), and ICV injection of LPS + CBX (group 4). Morris water maze (MWM) was conducted to evaluate spatial working memory. The brain and spinal cord were isolated from each rat with the collection of CSF. Our findings demonstrate that the localized administration of PHM and CBX can act as promising therapeutic approaches against AD. Additionally, Aβ and tau toxic aggregates were detected in the spinal cord and the CSF of the induced AD model concomitant with the brain tissues. Overall, it is suggested that the ICV administration of PHM and CBX can restore normal brain functions and alleviate AD hallmark depositions. Detecting these depositions in the spinal cord and CSF may be considered in AD early diagnosis. As such, conducting clinical research is recommended to reveal the benefits of related therapeutic approaches compared with preclinical findings.",2022,Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ; CBX; ICV; healthy microglia; inflammation; microgliosis; tau protein,,"Anwar, MM; Özkan, E; Shomalizadeh, N; Sapancı, S; Özler, C; Kesibi, J; Gürsoy-Özdemir, Y"
The paradigm of amyloid precursor protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: The potential role of the ,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive decline of neuronal function in several brain areas, and are always associated with cognitive, psychiatric, or motor deficits due to the atrophy of certain neuronal populations. Most neurodegenerative diseases share common pathological mechanisms, such as neurotoxic protein misfolding, oxidative stress, and impairment of autophagy machinery. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common adult-onset motor neuron disorders worldwide. It is clinically characterized by the selective and progressive loss of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord, ultimately leading to muscle atrophy and rapidly progressive paralysis. Multiple recent studies have indicated that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolytic fragments are not only drivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but also one of the earliest signatures in ALS, preceding or anticipating neuromuscular junction instability and denervation. Indeed, altered levels of APP peptides have been found in the brain, muscles, skin, and cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients. In this short review, we discuss the nature and extent of research evidence on the role of APP peptides in ALS, focusing on the intracellular C-terminal peptide and its regulatory motif ",2023,682YENPTY687 motif; Amyloid precursor protein; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Neurodegeneration,,"Matrone, C"

Blood-brain barrier opening of the default mode network in Alzheimer's disease with magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain but is also an important obstacle for the effective delivery of therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been shown to reversibly disrupt the BBB. However, treatment of diffuse regions across the brain along with the effect on Alzheimer's disease relevant pathology need to be better characterized. This study is an open-labelled single-arm trial (NCT04118764) to investigate the feasibility of modulating BBB permeability in the default mode network and the impact on cognition, amyloid and tau pathology as well as BBB integrity. Nine participants [mean age 70.2 ± 7.2 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 21.9] underwent three biweekly procedures with follow-up visits up to 6 months. The BBB permeability of the bilateral hippocampi, anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus was transiently increased without grade 3 or higher adverse events. Participants did not experience worsening trajectory of cognitive decline (ADAS-cog11, MMSE). Whole brain vertex-based analysis of the 18F-florbetaben PET imaging demonstrated clusters of modest SUVR reduction in the right parahippocampal and inferior temporal lobe. However, CSF and blood biomarkers did not demonstrate any amelioration of Alzheimer's disease pathology (P-tau181, amyloid-β42/40 ratio), nor did it show persistent BBB dysfunction (plasma PDGFRbeta and CSF-to-plasma albumin ratio). This study provides neuroimaging and fluid biomarker data to characterize the safety profile of MRgFUS BBB modulation in neurodegeneration as a potential strategy for enhanced therapeutic delivery.",2023,18F-florbetaben PET; Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; blood-brain barrier; focused ultrasound,Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Default Mode Network; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Meng, Y; Goubran, M; Rabin, JS; McSweeney, M; Ottoy, J; Pople, CB; Huang, Y; Storace, A; Ozzoude, M; Bethune, A; Lam, B; Swardfager, W; Heyn, C; Abrahao, A; Davidson, B; Hamani, C; Aubert, I; Zetterberg, H; Ashton, NJ; Karikari, TK; Blennow, K; Black, SE; Hynynen, K; Lipsman, N"
Interplay between the catecholaminergic enzymatic axis and neurodegeneration/neuroinflammation processes in the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,The locus coeruleus (LC) provides dopamine/noradrenaline (DA/NA) innervation throughout the brain and undergoes early degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

APLP2 is predominantly cleaved by β-secretase and γ-secretase in the human brain.,"Amyloid-β peptide is well-known as a pathogen of Alzheimer's disease, but its precursor, amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), remains unexplained 30 years after its discovery. APP has two homologues called amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), and shares a similar structural organisation with them and has partially overlapping functions. APP family proteins are essential for survival, shown by the crossbreeding analysis of knockout mice of APP family molecules, including APLP1 and APLP2. APLP2 is known to play the most important role among them, but the molecular metabolism of APLP2 is only partially understood.

Emerging Roles of Meningeal Lymphatic Vessels in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs), the functional lymphatic system present in the meninges, are the key drainage route responsible for the clearance of molecules, immune cells, and cellular debris from the cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid into deep cervical lymph nodes. Aging and ApoE4, the two most important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), induce mLV dysfunction, decrease cerebrospinal fluid influx and outflux, and exacerbate amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction. Dysfunction of mLVs results in the deposition of metabolic products, accelerates neuroinflammation, and promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Thus, mLVs represent a novel therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. This review aims to summarize the structure and function of mLVs and to discuss the potential effect of aging and ApoE4 on mLV dysfunction, as well as their roles in the pathogenesis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Apolipoprotein E4; amyloid-β; meningeal lymphatic vessels; tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Glymphatic System; Apolipoprotein E4; Lymphatic System; Lymphatic Vessels,"Guo, X; Zhang, G; Peng, Q; Huang, L; Zhang, Z; Zhang, Z"

The Synergic Effect of AT(N) Profiles and Depression on the Risk of Conversion to Dementia in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Few studies have addressed the impact of the association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and NPSs in the conversion to dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and no studies have been conducted on the interaction effect of these two risk factors. AT(N) profiles were created using AD-core biomarkers quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (normal, brain amyloidosis, suspected non-Alzheimer pathology (SNAP) and prodromal AD). NPSs were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). A total of 500 individuals with MCI were followed-up yearly in a memory unit. Cox regression analysis was used to determine risk of conversion, considering additive and multiplicative interactions between AT(N) profile and NPSs on the conversion to dementia. A total of 224 participants (44.8%) converted to dementia during the 2-year follow-up study. Pathologic AT(N) groups (brain amyloidosis, prodromal AD and SNAP) and the presence of depression and apathy were associated with a higher risk of conversion to dementia. The additive combination of the AT(N) profile with depression exacerbates the risk of conversion to dementia. A synergic effect of prodromal AD profile with depressive symptoms is evidenced, identifying the most exposed individuals to conversion among MCI patients.",2023,CSF; NPSs; dementia; interaction; mild cognitive impairment (MCI); synergic,Humans; Follow-Up Studies; Depression; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloidosis; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Neuropsychological Tests; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Marquié, M; García-Gutiérrez, F; Orellana, A; Montrreal, L; de Rojas, I; García-González, P; Puerta, R; Olivé, C; Cano, A; Hernández, I; Rosende-Roca, M; Vargas, L; Tartari, JP; Esteban-De Antonio, E; Bojaryn, U; Ricciardi, M; Ariton, DM; Pytel, V; Alegret, M; Ortega, G; Espinosa, A; Pérez-Cordón, A; Sanabria, Á; Muñoz, N; Lleonart, N; Aguilera, N; García-Sánchez, A; Alarcón-Martín, E; Tárraga, L; Ruiz, A; Boada, M; Valero, S"

Mendelian Randomisation Confirms the Role of Y-Chromosome Loss in Alzheimer's Disease Aetiopathogenesis in Men.,"Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) is a common ageing-related somatic event and has been previously associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, mLOY estimation from genotype microarray data only reflects the mLOY degree of subjects at the moment of DNA sampling. Therefore, mLOY phenotype associations with AD can be severely age-confounded in the context of genome-wide association studies. Here, we applied Mendelian randomisation to construct an age-independent mLOY polygenic risk score (mloy-PRS) using 114 autosomal variants.

"1,2-","Neuroinflammation is one of the common features in most neurological diseases including multiple sclerosis (MScl) and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is associated with local brain inflammation, microglial activation, and infiltration of peripheral immune cells into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the central nervous system (CNS). It has been shown that the diversity of phenotypic changes in monocytes in CSF relates to neuroinflammation. It remains to be investigated whether these phenotypic changes are associated with functional or metabolic alteration, which may give a hint to their function or changes in cell states, e.g., cell activation. In this article, we investigate whether major metabolic pathways of blood monocytes alter after exposure to CSF of healthy individuals or patients with AD or MScl. Our findings show a significant alteration of the metabolism of monocytes treated with CSF from patients and healthy donors, including higher production of citric acid and glutamine, suggesting a more active glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and reduced production of glycine and serine. These alterations suggest metabolic reprogramming of monocytes, possibly related to the change of compartment (from blood to CSF) and/or disease-related. Moreover, the levels of serine differ between AD and MScl, suggesting different phenotypic alterations between diseases.",2023,Alzheimer; cerebrospinal fluid; glycolysis; metabolism; metabolites; monocytes; multiple sclerosis; neuroinflammation; tricarboxylic acid cycle,,"Giacomello, G; Otto, C; Priller, J; Ruprecht, K; Böttcher, C; Parr, MK"
Seed amplification assay for the detection of pathologic alpha-synuclein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid.,"Misfolded alpha-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates are a hallmark event in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Recently, αSyn seed amplification assays (αSyn-SAAs) have shown promise as a test for biochemical diagnosis of synucleinopathies. αSyn-SAAs use the intrinsic self-replicative nature of misfolded αSyn aggregates (seeds) to multiply them in vitro. In these assays, αSyn seeds circulating in biological fluids are amplified by a cyclical process that includes aggregate fragmentation into smaller self-propagating seeds, followed by elongation at the expense of recombinant αSyn (rec-αSyn). Amplification of the seeds allows detection by fluorescent dyes specific for amyloids, such as thioflavin T. Several αSyn-SAA reports have been published in the past under the names 'protein misfolding cyclic amplification' (αSyn-PMCA) and 'real-time quaking-induced conversion'. Here, we describe a protocol for αSyn-SAA, originally reported as αSyn-PMCA, which allows detection of αSyn aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients affected by PD, dementia with Lewy bodies or multiple-system atrophy (MSA). Moreover, this αSyn-SAA can differentiate αSyn aggregates from patients with PD versus those from patients with MSA, even in retrospective samples from patients with pure autonomic failure who later developed PD or MSA. We also describe modifications to the original protocol introduced to develop an optimized version of the assay. The optimized version shortens the assay length, decreases the amount of rec-αSyn required and reduces the number of inconclusive results. The protocol has a hands-on time of ~2 h per 96-well plate and can be performed by personnel trained to perform basic experiments with specimens of human origin.",2023,,Humans; alpha-Synuclein; Synucleinopathies; Retrospective Studies; Parkinson Disease,"Concha-Marambio, L; Pritzkow, S; Shahnawaz, M; Farris, CM; Soto, C"
Nicked tRNAs are stable reservoirs of tRNA halves in cells and biofluids.,"Nonvesicular extracellular RNAs (nv-exRNAs) constitute the majority of the extracellular RNAome, but little is known about their stability, function, and potential use as disease biomarkers. Herein, we measured the stability of several naked RNAs when incubated in human serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We identified extracellularly produced tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs) with half-lives of several hours in CSF. Contrary to widespread assumptions, these intrinsically stable small RNAs are full-length tRNAs containing broken phosphodiester bonds (i.e., nicked tRNAs). Standard molecular biology protocols, including phenol-based RNA extraction and heat, induce the artifactual denaturation of nicked tRNAs and the consequent in vitro production of tDRs. Broken bonds are roadblocks for reverse transcriptases, preventing amplification and/or sequencing of nicked tRNAs in their native state. To solve this, we performed enzymatic repair of nicked tRNAs purified under native conditions, harnessing the intrinsic activity of phage and bacterial tRNA repair systems. Enzymatic repair regenerated an RNase R-resistant tRNA-sized band in northern blot and enabled RT-PCR amplification of full-length tRNAs. We also separated nicked tRNAs from tDRs by chromatographic methods under native conditions, identifying nicked tRNAs inside stressed cells and in vesicle-depleted human biofluids. Dissociation of nicked tRNAs produces single-stranded tDRs that can be spontaneously taken up by human epithelial cells, positioning stable nv-exRNAs as potentially relevant players in intercellular communication pathways.",2023,RNA stability; extracellular RNA; liquid biopsies; tRF; tRNA halves,"Humans; RNA, Transfer; RNA; Bacteria; Epithelial Cells","Costa, B; Li Calzi, M; Castellano, M; Blanco, V; Cuevasanta, E; Litvan, I; Ivanov, P; Witwer, K; Cayota, A; Tosar, JP"

The foundation and architecture of precision medicine in neurology and psychiatry.,"Neurological and psychiatric diseases have high degrees of genetic and pathophysiological heterogeneity, irrespective of clinical manifestations. Traditional medical paradigms have focused on late-stage syndromic aspects of these diseases, with little consideration of the underlying biology. Advances in disease modeling and methodological design have paved the way for the development of precision medicine (PM), an established concept in oncology with growing attention from other medical specialties. We propose a PM architecture for central nervous system diseases built on four converging pillars: multimodal biomarkers, systems medicine, digital health technologies, and data science. We discuss Alzheimer's disease (AD), an area of significant unmet medical need, as a case-in-point for the proposed framework.

Fluid biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterization has progressed from being indexed using clinical symptomatology followed by neuropathological examination at autopsy to in vivo signatures using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and positron emission tomography. The core AD biomarkers reflect amyloid-β plaques (A), tau pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N), following the ATN schedule, and are now being introduced into clinical routine practice. This is an important development, as disease-modifying treatments are now emerging. Further, there are now reproducible data on CSF biomarkers which reflect synaptic pathology, neuroinflammation and common co-pathologies. In addition, the development of ultrasensitive techniques has enabled the core CSF biomarkers of AD pathophysiology to be translated to blood (e.g., phosphorylated tau, amyloid-β and neurofilament light).

Interaction Between the Glymphatic System and α-Synuclein in Parkinson's Disease.,"The glymphatic system contributes to the clearance of amyloid-β from the brain and is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease. However, whether the system is involved in the removal of α-synuclein (α-syn) and whether it is suppressed in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain largely unknown. In mice receiving the intranigral injection of recombinant human α-syn, we found that the glymphatic suppression via aquaporin-4 (AQP4) gene deletion or acetazolamide treatment reduced the clearance of injected α-syn from the brain. In mice overexpressing the human A53T-α-syn, we revealed that AQP4 deficiency accelerated the accumulation of α-syn, facilitated the loss of dopaminergic neurons, and accelerated PD-like symptoms. We also found that the overexpression of A53T-α-syn reduced the expression/polarization of AQP4 and suppressed the glymphatic activity of mice. The study demonstrates a close interaction between the AQP4-mediated glymphatic system and parenchymal α-syn, indicating that restoring the glymphatic activity is a potential therapeutic target to delay PD progression.",2023,Aquaporin-4; Cerebrospinal fluid; Glymphatic system; Parkinson’s disease; α-Synuclein,Mice; Humans; Animals; Parkinson Disease; alpha-Synuclein; Glymphatic System; Brain; Alzheimer Disease,"Zhang, Y; Zhang, C; He, XZ; Li, ZH; Meng, JC; Mao, RT; Li, X; Xue, R; Gui, Q; Zhang, GX; Wang, LH"

The recency ratio assessed by story recall is associated with cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurodegeneration biomarkers.,"Recency refers to the information learned at the end of a study list or task. Recency forgetting, as tracked by the ratio between recency recall in immediate and delayed conditions, i.e., the recency ratio (Rr), has been applied to list-learning tasks, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting cognitive decline, conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration. However, little is known as to whether Rr can be effectively applied to story recall tasks. To address this question, data were extracted from the database of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. A total of 212 participants were included in the study. CSF biomarkers were amyloid-beta (Aβ) 40 and 42, phosphorylated (p) and total (t) tau, neurofilament light (NFL), neurogranin (Ng), and α-synuclein (a-syn). Story Recall was measured with the Logical Memory Test (LMT). We carried out Bayesian regression analyses with Rr, and other LMT scores as predictors; and CSF biomarkers (including the Aβ42/40 and p-tau/Aβ42 ratios) as outcomes. Results showed that models including Rr consistently provided best fits with the data, with few exceptions. These findings demonstrate the applicability of Rr to story recall and its sensitivity to CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and encourage its inclusion when evaluating risk of neurodegeneration with story recall.",2023,Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; Dementia; Memory assessment; Serial position effects; Story recall,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Bayes Theorem; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Neurons,"Bruno, D; Jauregi Zinkunegi, A; Kollmorgen, G; Suridjan, I; Wild, N; Carlsson, C; Bendlin, B; Okonkwo, O; Chin, N; Hermann, BP; Asthana, S; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Langhough, R; Johnson, SC; Mueller, KD"
Plasma biomarker profiles in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"Emerging plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease might be non-invasive tools to trace early Alzheimer's disease-related abnormalities such as the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides, neurofibrillary tau tangles, glial activation and neurodegeneration. It is, however, unclear which pathological processes in the CNS can be adequately detected by peripheral measurements and whether plasma biomarkers are equally applicable in both clinical and preclinical phases. Here we aimed to explore the timing and performance of plasma biomarkers in mutation carriers compared to non-carriers in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Samples (n = 164) from mutation carriers (n = 33) and non-carriers (n = 42) in a Swedish cohort of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (APP p.KM670/671NL, APP p.E693G and PSEN1 p.H163Y) were included in explorative longitudinal analyses. Plasma phosphorylated tau (P-tau181), total tau (T-tau), neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentrations were measured with a single-molecule array method as previously described. Plasma biomarkers were additionally correlated to Alzheimer's disease core biomarkers in the CSF. Results from the longitudinal analyses confirmed that plasma P-tau181, NfL and GFAP concentrations were higher in mutation carriers compared to non-carriers. This change was observed in the presymptomatic phase and detectable first as an increase in GFAP approximately 10 years before estimated symptom onset, followed by increased levels of P-tau181 and NfL closer to expected onset. Plasma P-tau181 levels were correlated to levels of P-tau181 and T-tau in the CSF. Altogether, plasma P-tau181, GFAP and NfL seem to be feasible biomarkers to detect different Alzheimer's disease-related pathologies already in presymptomatic individuals. Interestingly, changes in plasma GFAP concentrations were detected prior to P-tau181 and NfL. Our results suggest that plasma GFAP might reflect Alzheimer's disease pathology upstream to accumulation of tangles and neurodegeneration. The implications of these findings need additional validation, in particular because of the limited sample size.",2023,autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neurofilament light chain; plasma biomarker; tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Genes, Dominant","Johansson, C; Thordardottir, S; Laffita-Mesa, J; Rodriguez-Vieitez, E; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Graff, C"
Brain network decoupling with increased serum neurofilament and reduced cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neurofilament light chain, a putative measure of neuronal damage, is measurable in blood and CSF and is predictive of cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. There has been limited prior work linking neurofilament light and functional connectivity, and no prior work has investigated neurofilament light associations with functional connectivity in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Here, we assessed relationships between blood neurofilament light, cognition, and functional connectivity in a cross-sectional sample of 106 autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers and 76 non-carriers. We employed an innovative network-level enrichment analysis approach to assess connectome-wide associations with neurofilament light. Neurofilament light was positively correlated with deterioration of functional connectivity within the default mode network and negatively correlated with connectivity between default mode network and executive control networks, including the cingulo-opercular, salience, and dorsal attention networks. Further, reduced connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and executive control networks was associated with reduced cognitive function. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that neurofilament levels and functional connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and the dorsal attention network explained significant variance in cognitive composite scores when controlling for age, sex, and education. A mediation analysis demonstrated that functional connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and dorsal attention network partially mediated the relationship between blood neurofilament light levels and cognitive function. Our novel results indicate that blood estimates of neurofilament levels correspond to direct measurements of brain dysfunction, shedding new light on the underlying biological processes of Alzheimer's disease. Further, we demonstrate how variation within key brain systems can partially mediate the negative effects of heightened total serum neurofilament levels, suggesting potential regions for targeted interventions. Finally, our results lend further evidence that low-cost and minimally invasive blood measurements of neurofilament may be a useful marker of brain functional connectivity and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.",2023,NfL; default mode network; enrichment; functional connectivity; neurodegeneration; resting state,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Connectome; Nerve Net,"Wheelock, MD; Strain, JF; Mansfield, P; Tu, JC; Tanenbaum, A; Preische, O; Chhatwal, JP; Cash, DM; Cruchaga, C; Fagan, AM; Fox, NC; Graff-Radford, NR; Hassenstab, J; Jack, CR; Karch, CM; Levin, J; McDade, EM; Perrin, RJ; Schofield, PR; Xiong, C; Morris, JC; Bateman, RJ; Jucker, M; Benzinger, TLS; Ances, BM; Eggebrecht, AT; Gordon, BA"
Neurogranin in Alzheimer's disease and ageing: A human post-mortem study.,"Neurogranin (Ng), a post-synaptic protein involved in memory formation, has been investigated as a biomarker in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and ageing. CSF Ng levels are elevated in AD relative to healthy controls and correlate with cognition; however, few studies have focused on Ng abundance in the brain. Synapse loss in the brain correlates closely with cognitive decline in AD making synaptic biomarkers potentially important for tracking disease progression, but the links between synaptic protein changes in CSF and brain remain incompletely understood. In the current study, Ng abundance was examined in post-mortem human brain tissue across AD, healthy ageing (HA), and mid-life (ML) cohorts. Ng levels were quantified in three brain regions associated with cognitive change found during ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, namely the middle temporal gyrus, primary visual cortex and the posterior hippocampus using immunohistochemistry. To support immunohistochemical analysis, total homogenate and biochemically enriched synaptic fractions from available temporal gyrus tissues were examined by immunoblot. Finally, we examined whether Ng is associated with lifetime cognitive ageing. Ng levels were significantly reduced in AD relative to HA and ML cases across all regions. Additionally Ng was significantly reduced in HA in comparison to ML in the primary visual cortex. Immunoblotting confirms reduced Ng levels in AD cases supporting immunohistochemical results. Interestingly, there was also a significant reduction of synapse-associated Ng in our group who had lifetime cognitive decline in comparison to the group with lifetime cognitive resilience indicating loss of neurogranin in remaining synapses during ageing is associated with cognitive decline. Our findings indicate that increases in CSF Ng reflect loss of brain neurogranin and support the use of CSF Ng as a biomarker of AD and potentially of cognitive decline in healthy ageing.",2023,Ageing; Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; Cerebrospinal fluid; Neurogranin; Post-synaptic,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurogranin; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Saunders, T; Gunn, C; Blennow, K; Kvartsberg, H; Zetterberg, H; Shenkin, SD; Cox, SR; Deary, IJ; Smith, C; King, D; Spires-Jones, T"

Choroid Plexus Aquaporins in CSF Homeostasis and the Glymphatic System: Their Relevance for Alzheimer's Disease.,"The glymphatic system, a fluid-clearance pathway involved in brain waste clearance, is known to be impaired in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason, it is important to understand the specific mechanisms and factors controlling glymphatic function. This pathway enables the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the brain and subsequently the brain interstitium, supported by aquaporins (AQPs). Continuous CSF transport through the brain parenchyma is critical for the effective transport and drainage of waste solutes, such as toxic proteins, through the glymphatic system. However, a balance between CSF production and secretion from the choroid plexus, through AQP regulation, is also needed. Thus, any condition that affects CSF homeostasis will also interfere with effective waste removal through the clearance glymphatic pathway and the subsequent processes of neurodegeneration. In this review, we highlight the role of AQPs in the choroid plexus in the modulation of CSF homeostasis and, consequently, the glymphatic clearance pathway, with a special focus on AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aquaporins; astrocytes; cerebrospinal fluid; choroid plexus; clearance; glymphatic system; homeostasis,Humans; Glymphatic System; Alzheimer Disease; Choroid Plexus; Brain; Homeostasis; Aquaporins,"Municio, C; Carrero, L; Antequera, D; Carro, E"
Functional Correlates of Striatal Dopamine Transporter Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels in Alzheimer's Disease: A Preliminary ,"The aim of our study was to investigate regional glucose metabolism with 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography in a population of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in relation to cerebrospinal (CSF) levels of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT). All patients underwent lumbar puncture and received a biomarker-based diagnosis of AD. Differences in regional brain glucose metabolism were assessed by Statistical Parametric Mapping version 12 with the use of age, gender, and MMSE as covariates in the analysis. A positive correlation between CSF DAT levels and glucose metabolism at the level of two brain areas involved in the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease, the substantia nigra and the posterior cingulate gyrus, has been highlighted. Results indicate that patients with higher CSF DAT levels have a better metabolic pattern in two key zones, suggesting less advanced disease status in patients with more conserved dopaminergic systems.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; DAT; FDG-PET; dementia; dopaminergic impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Positron-Emission Tomography; Brain; Glucose,"Camedda, R; Bonomi, CG; Di Donna, MG; Chiaravalloti, A"

Neuronal deletion of nSMase2 reduces the production of Aβ and directly protects neurons.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been proposed to regulate the deposition of Aβ. Multiple publications have shown that APP, amyloid processing enzymes and Aβ peptides are associated with EVs. However, very little Aβ is associated with EVs compared with the total amount Aβ present in human plasma, CSF, or supernatants from cultured neurons. The involvement of EVs has largely been inferred by pharmacological inhibition or whole body deletion of the sphingomyelin hydrolase neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) that is a key regulator for the biogenesis of at-least one population of EVs. Here we used a Cre-Lox system to selectively delete nSMase2 from pyramidal neurons in APP/PS1 mice (APP/PS1-SMPD3-Nex1) and found a ∼ 70% reduction in Aβ deposition at 6 months of age and ∼ 35% reduction at 12 months of age in both cortex and hippocampus. Brain ceramides were increased in APP/PS1 compared with Wt mice, but were similar to Wt in APP/PS1-SMPD3-Nex1 mice suggesting that elevated brain ceramides in this model involves neuronally expressed nSMase2. Reduced levels of PSD95 and deficits of long-term potentiation in APP/PS1 mice were normalized in APP/PS1-SMPD3-Nex1 mice. In contrast, elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-8 and TNFα in APP/PS1 mice were not normalized in APP/PS1-SMPD3-Nex1 mice compared with APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistic studies showed that the size of liquid ordered membrane microdomains was increased in APP/PS1 mice, as were the amounts of APP and BACE1 localized to these microdomains. Pharmacological inhibition of nSMase2 activity with PDDC reduced the size of the liquid ordered membrane microdomains, reduced the localization of APP with BACE1 and reduced the production of Aβ",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-β; Ceramide; Extracellular vesicles (EVs); LTP; Long term potentiation; Sphingomyelinase; nSMase2,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Mice, Transgenic; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neurons; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Presenilin-1; Disease Models, Animal; Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase","Tohumeken, S; Deme, P; Yoo, SW; Gupta, S; Rais, R; Slusher, BS; Haughey, NJ"

From Determining Brain Insulin Resistance in a Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease Model to Exploring the Region-Dependent Effect of Intranasal Insulin.,"Impaired response to insulin has been linked to many neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Animal model of sporadic AD has been developed by intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of streptozotocin (STZ), which given peripherally causes insulin resistance. Difficulty in demonstrating insulin resistance in this model led to our aim: to determine brain regional and peripheral response after intranasal (IN) administration of insulin in control and STZ-icv rats, by exploring peripheral and central metabolic parameters. One month after STZ-icv or vehicle-icv administration to 3-month-old male Wistar rats, cognitive status was determined after which rats received 2 IU of fast-acting insulin aspart intranasally (CTR + INS; STZ + INS) or saline only (CTR and STZ). Rats were sacrificed 2 h after administration and metabolic and glutamatergic parameters were measured in plasma, CSF, and the brain. Insulin and STZ increased amyloid-β concentration in plasma (CTR + INS and STZ vs CTR), while there was no effect on glucose and insulin plasma and CSF levels. INS normalized the levels of c-fos in temporal cortex of STZ + INS vs STZ (co-localized with neurons), while hypothalamic c-fos was found co-localized with the microglial marker. STZ and insulin brain region specifically altered the levels and activity of proteins involved in cell metabolism and glutamate signaling. Central changes found after INS in STZ-icv rats suggest hippocampal and cortical insulin sensitivity. Altered hypothalamic metabolic parameters of STZ-icv rats were not normalized by INS, indicating possible hypothalamic insulin insensitivity. Brain insulin sensitivity depends on the affected brain region and presence of metabolic dysfunction induced by STZ-icv administration.",2023,C-fos; Glutamate; Insulin resistance; Intranasal insulin; Streptozotocin,"Rats; Male; Animals; Insulin; Alzheimer Disease; Insulin Resistance; Rats, Wistar; Brain; Streptozocin; Disease Models, Animal; Maze Learning","Knezovic, A; Budisa, S; Babic Perhoc, A; Homolak, J; Osmanovic Barilar, J"

Role of monomeric amyloid-β in cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from clinical trials with secretase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.,"According to the β-amyloid (Aβ) hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain Aβ accumulation is the primary cascade event leading to cognitive deficit and dementia. Numerous anti-Aβ drugs either inhibiting production or aggregation of Aβ or stimulating its clearance have failed to show clinical benefit in large scale AD trials, with β- and γ-secretase inhibitors consistently worsening cognitive and clinical decline. In June 2021, the FDA approved aducanumab, an anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody for early AD based on its ability to reduce brain amyloid plaques, while two other amyloid-clearing antibodies (lecanemab and donanemab) have recently produced encouraging cognitive and clinical results. We reviewed AD trials using PubMed, meeting abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov and evaluated the effects of such drugs on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ levels, correlating them with cognitive effects. We found that β-secretase and γ-secretase inhibitors produce detrimental cognitive effects by significantly reducing CSF Aβ levels. We speculate that monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ protofibrils, fibrils or plaques may improve cognitive performance in early AD by increasing soluble Aβ levels through Aβ aggregate disassembly and/or stabilization of existing Aβ monomers.These findings suggest that the real culprit in AD may be decreased levels of soluble monomeric Aβ due to sequestration into brain Aβ aggregates and plaques.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies; BACE inhibitors; CSF amyloid-β42; Monomeric amyloid-β; γ-secretase inhibitors,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognition","Imbimbo, BP; Ippati, S; Watling, M; Imbimbo, C"
Regional transcriptional vulnerability to basal forebrain functional dysconnectivity in mild cognitive impairment patients.,"Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM), one of the earliest targets of Alzheimer's disease (AD), may act as a seed for pathological spreading to its connected regions. However, the underlying basis of regional vulnerability to NbM dysconnectivity remains unclear. NbM functional dysconnectivity was assessed using resting-state fMRI data of health controls and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI2/GO phase). Transcriptional correlates of NbM dysconnectivity was explored by leveraging public intrinsic and differential post-mortem brain-wide gene expression datasets from Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB). By constructing an individual-level tissue-specific gene set risk score (TGRS), we evaluated the contribution of NbM dysconnectivity-correlated gene sets to change rate of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers during preclinical stage of AD, as well as to MCI onset age. An independent cohort of health controls and MCI patients from ADNI3 was used to validate our main findings. Between-group comparison revealed significant connectivity reduction between the right NbM and right middle temporal gyrus in MCI. This regional vulnerability to NbM dysconnectivity correlated with intrinsic expression of genes enriched in protein and immune functions, as well as with differential expression of genes enriched in cholinergic receptors, immune, vascular and energy metabolism functions. TGRS of these NbM dysconnectivity-correlated gene sets are associated with longitudinal amyloid-beta change at preclinical stages of AD, and contributed to MCI onset age independent of traditional AD risks. Our findings revealed the transcriptional vulnerability to NbM dysconnectivity and their crucial role in explaining preclinical amyloid-beta change and MCI onset age, which offer new insights into the early AD pathology and encourage more investigation and clinical trials targeting NbM.",2023,Basal forebrain; Functional connectivity; Mild cognitive impairment; Nucleus basalis of Meynert; Tissue-specific geneset risk score; Transcriptional vulnerability,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Basal Forebrain; Basal Nucleus of Meynert; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Ren, P; Ding, W; Li, S; Liu, G; Luo, M; Zhou, W; Cheng, R; Li, Y; Wang, P; Li, Z; Yao, L; Jiang, Q; Liang, X"

Circadian rhythmicity of amyloid-beta-related molecules is disrupted in the choroid plexus of a female Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"The choroid plexus (CP) is part of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) and was recently described as an important component of the circadian clock system. It is the principal source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and responsible for the synthesis and secretion of various neuroprotective peptides including those involved in amyloid-β (Aβ) transport/degradation, contributing to Aβ homeostasis. Inadequate Aβ metabolic clearance and transport across the BCSFB have been associated with circadian dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. To investigate whether AD pathology influences Aβ scavengers circadian expression, we collected CP at different time points from an AD mouse model (APP/PS1) (female and male animals, aged 6- and 12-months-old) and analyzed their mRNA expression by Real-time RT-PCR. Only angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace) expression in 6-month-old female wild-type mice and transthyretin (Ttr) expression in 12-month-old female wild-type mice presented significant rhythmicity. The circadian rhythmicity of Ace and Ttr, prompt us to analyze the involvement of circadian rhythm in Aβ uptake.

Brain-derived tau: a novel blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration.,"Blood-based biomarkers for amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau show good diagnostic accuracies and agreements with their corresponding CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration [A/T/(N)] framework for Alzheimer's disease. However, the blood-based neurodegeneration marker neurofilament light is not specific to Alzheimer's disease while total-tau shows lack of correlation with CSF total-tau. Recent studies suggest that blood total-tau originates principally from peripheral, non-brain sources. We sought to address this challenge by generating an anti-tau antibody that selectively binds brain-derived tau and avoids the peripherally expressed 'big tau' isoform. We applied this antibody to develop an ultrasensitive blood-based assay for brain-derived tau, and validated it in five independent cohorts (n = 609) including a blood-to-autopsy cohort, CSF biomarker-classified cohorts and memory clinic cohorts. In paired samples, serum and CSF brain-derived tau were significantly correlated (rho = 0.85, P < 0.0001), while serum and CSF total-tau were not (rho = 0.23, P = 0.3364). Blood-based brain-derived tau showed equivalent diagnostic performance as CSF total-tau and CSF brain-derived tau to separate biomarker-positive Alzheimer's disease participants from biomarker-negative controls. Furthermore, plasma brain-derived tau accurately distinguished autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative diseases (area under the curve = 86.4%) while neurofilament light did not (area under the curve = 54.3%). These performances were independent of the presence of concomitant pathologies. Plasma brain-derived tau (rho = 0.52-0.67, P = 0.003), but not neurofilament light (rho = -0.14-0.17, P = 0.501), was associated with global and regional amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts. These results were further verified in two memory clinic cohorts where serum brain-derived tau differentiated Alzheimer's disease from a range of other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and atypical parkinsonian disorders (area under the curve up to 99.6%). Notably, plasma/serum brain-derived tau correlated with neurofilament light only in Alzheimer's disease but not in the other neurodegenerative diseases. Across cohorts, plasma/serum brain-derived tau was associated with CSF and plasma AT(N) biomarkers and cognitive function. Brain-derived tau is a new blood-based biomarker that outperforms plasma total-tau and, unlike neurofilament light, shows specificity to Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration. Thus, brain-derived tau demonstrates potential to complete the AT(N) scheme in blood, and will be useful to evaluate Alzheimer's disease-dependent neurodegenerative processes for clinical and research purposes.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; neurodegenerative disease; neurofilament light; plasma brain-derived-tau; total-tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Brain; Biomarkers,"Gonzalez-Ortiz, F; Turton, M; Kac, PR; Smirnov, D; Premi, E; Ghidoni, R; Benussi, L; Cantoni, V; Saraceno, C; Rivolta, J; Ashton, NJ; Borroni, B; Galasko, D; Harrison, P; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Karikari, TK"

Plasma Core Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Predict Amyloid Deposition Burden by Positron Emission Tomography in Chinese Individuals with Cognitive Decline.,"Blood-based biomarkers have been considered as a promising method for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Proteomic clusters underlie heterogeneity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease progression.,"Heterogeneity in progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses challenges for both clinical prognosis and clinical trial implementation. Multiple AD-related subtypes have previously been identified, suggesting differences in receptivity to drug interventions. We identified early differences in preclinical AD biomarkers, assessed patterns for developing preclinical AD across the amyloid-tau-(neurodegeneration) [AT(N)] framework, and considered potential sources of difference by analysing the CSF proteome. Participants (n = 10) enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center completed four or more lumbar punctures. These individuals were cognitively normal at baseline. Cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid-β (Aβ)42, phosphorylated tau (pTau181), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) as well as proteomics values were evaluated. Imaging biomarkers, including PET amyloid and tau, and structural MRI, were repeatedly obtained when available. Individuals were staged according to the amyloid-tau-(neurodegeneration) framework. Growth mixture modelling, an unsupervised clustering technique, identified three patterns of biomarker progression as measured by CSF pTau181 and Aβ42. Two groups (AD Biomarker Positive and Intermediate AD Biomarker) showed distinct progression from normal biomarker status to having biomarkers consistent with preclinical AD. A third group (AD Biomarker Negative) did not develop abnormal AD biomarkers over time. Participants grouped by CSF trajectories were re-classified using only proteomic profiles (AUCAD Biomarker Positive versus AD Biomarker Negative = 0.857, AUCAD Biomarker Positive versus Intermediate AD Biomarkers = 0.525, AUCIntermediate AD Biomarkers versus AD Biomarker Negative = 0.952). We highlight heterogeneity in the development of AD biomarkers in cognitively normal individuals. We identified some individuals who became amyloid positive before the age of 50 years. A second group, Intermediate AD Biomarkers, developed elevated CSF ptau181 significantly before becoming amyloid positive. A third group were AD Biomarker Negative over repeated testing. Our results could influence the selection of participants for specific treatments (e.g. amyloid-reducing versus other agents) in clinical trials.

MS-DAP Platform for Downstream Data Analysis of Label-Free Proteomics Uncovers Optimal Workflows in Benchmark Data Sets and Increased Sensitivity in Analysis of Alzheimer's Biomarker Data.,"In the rapidly moving proteomics field, a diverse patchwork of data analysis pipelines and algorithms for data normalization and differential expression analysis is used by the community. We generated a mass spectrometry downstream analysis pipeline (MS-DAP) that integrates both popular and recently developed algorithms for normalization and statistical analyses. Additional algorithms can be easily added in the future as plugins. MS-DAP is open-source and facilitates transparent and reproducible proteome science by generating extensive data visualizations and quality reporting, provided as standardized PDF reports. Second, we performed a systematic evaluation of methods for normalization and statistical analysis on a large variety of data sets, including additional data generated in this study, which revealed key differences. Commonly used approaches for differential testing based on moderated t-statistics were consistently outperformed by more recent statistical models, all integrated in MS-DAP. Third, we introduced a novel normalization algorithm that rescues deficiencies observed in commonly used normalization methods. Finally, we used the MS-DAP platform to reanalyze a recently published large-scale proteomics data set of CSF from AD patients. This revealed increased sensitivity, resulting in additional significant target proteins which improved overlap with results reported in related studies and includes a large set of new potential AD biomarkers in addition to previously reported.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; benchmarking; bioinformatics; proteomics; software,Humans; Software; Proteomics; Benchmarking; Workflow; Alzheimer Disease; Proteome; Mass Spectrometry; Biomarkers,"Koopmans, F; Li, KW; Klaassen, RV; Smit, AB"
Polygenic resilience score may be sensitive to preclinical Alzheimer's disease changes.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a polygenic disorder with a long prodromal phase, making early diagnosis challenging. Twin studies estimate LOAD as 60-80% heritable, and while common genetic variants can account for 30% of this heritability, nearly 70% remains ""missing"". Polygenic risk scores (PRS) leverage combined effects of many loci to predict LOAD risk, but often lack sensitivity to preclinical disease changes, limiting clinical utility. Our group has built and published on a resilience phenotype to model better-than-expected cognition give amyloid pathology burden and hypothesized it may assist in preclinical polygenic risk prediction. Thus, we built a LOAD PRS and a resilience PRS and evaluated both in predicting cognition in a dementia-free cohort (N=254). The LOAD PRS had a significant main effect on baseline memory (β=-0.18, P=1.68E-03). Both the LOAD PRS (β=-0.03, P=1.19E-03) and the resilience PRS (β=0.02, P=0.03) had significant main effects on annual memory decline. The resilience PRS interacted with CSF Aβ on baseline memory (β=-6.04E-04, P=0.02), whereby it predicted baseline memory among Aβ+ individuals (β=0.44, P=0.01) but not among Aβ- individuals (β=0.06, P=0.46). Excluding APOE from PRS resulted in mainly LOAD PRS associations attenuating, but notably the resilience PRS interaction with CSF Aβ and selective prediction among Aβ+ individuals was consistent. Although the resilience PRS is currently somewhat limited in scope from the phenotype's cross-sectional nature, our results suggest that the resilience PRS may be a promising tool in assisting in preclinical disease risk prediction among dementia-free and Aβ+ individuals, though replication and fine-tuning are needed.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Computational Biology; Risk Factors,"Eissman, JM; Wells, G; Khan, OA; Liu, D; Petyuk, VA; Gifford, KA; Dumitrescu, L; Jefferson, AL; Hohman, TJ"
Decoding the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and progression using multilayer networks.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disorder, which makes early detection a challenge. Studies have attempted to combine biomarkers to improve AD detection and predict progression. However, most of the existing work reports results in parallel or compares normalized findings but does not analyze data simultaneously. We tested a multi-dimensional network framework, applied to 490 subjects (cognitively normal [CN] = 147; mild cognitive impairment [MCI] = 287; AD = 56) from ADNI, to create a single model capable of capturing the heterogeneity and progression of AD. First, we constructed subject similarity networks for structural magnetic resonance imaging, amyloid-β positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid, cognition, and genetics data and then applied multilayer community detection to find groups with shared similarities across modalities. Individuals were also followed-up longitudinally, with AD subjects having, on average, 4.5 years of follow-up. Our findings show that multilayer community detection allows for accurate identification of present and future AD (≈90%) and is also able to identify cases that were misdiagnosed clinically. From all MCI participants who developed AD or reverted to CN, the multilayer model correctly identified 90.8% and 88.5% of cases respectively. We observed similar subtypes across the full sample and when examining multimodal data from subjects with no AD pathology (i.e., amyloid negative). Finally, these results were also validated using an independent testing set. In summary, the multilayer framework is successful in detecting AD and provides unique insight into the heterogeneity of the disease by identifying subtypes that share similar multidisciplinary profiles of neurological, cognitive, pathological, and genetics information.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognition; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Disease Progression,"Avelar-Pereira, B; Belloy, ME; O'Hara, R; Hosseini, SMH"

Novel developments in non-contrast enhanced MRI of the perivascular clearance system: What are the possibilities for Alzheimer's disease research?,"The cerebral waste clearance system (i.e, glymphatic or intramural periarterial drainage) works through a network of perivascular spaces (PVS). Dysfunction of this system likely contributes to aggregation of Amyloid-β and subsequent toxic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising, non-invasive technique to study this system is MRI, though applications in dementia are still scarce. This review focusses on recent non-contrast enhanced (non-CE) MRI techniques which determine and visualise physiological aspects of the clearance system at multiple levels, i.e., cerebrospinal fluid flow, PVS-flow and interstitial fluid movement. Furthermore, various MRI studies focussing on aspects of the clearance system which are relevant to AD are discussed, such as studies on ageing, sleep alterations, and cognitive decline. Additionally, the complementary function of non-CE to CE methods is elaborated upon. We conclude that non-CE studies have great potential to determine which parts of the waste clearance system are affected by AD and in which stages of cognitive impairment dysfunction of this system occurs, which could allow future clinical trials to target these specific mechanisms.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebral waste clearance; Cognitive decline; Dementia; Glymphatic; Intramural periarterial drainage; Non-contrast enhanced MRI,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Glymphatic System; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain,"van der Thiel, MM; Backes, WH; Ramakers, IHGB; Jansen, JFA"
The Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease: A Patient-Centred Conversation with the Care Team.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases, affecting approximately 10 million people in Europe. Neuroimaging techniques and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers used in combination with cognitive assessment tools open the door to early diagnosis of AD. However, these tools present some challenges that need to be overcome, such as low sensitivity or specificity, high cost, limited availability or invasiveness. Thus, low-cost and non-invasive alternatives, such as plasma biomarkers, have the potential to drive changes in AD screening and diagnosis. In addition to the technical aspects, organisational challenges as well as ethical concerns need to be addressed. In many countries, there is an insufficient number of specialists to recognise, evaluate and diagnose dementia and the waiting times to see a specialist are long. Given that there is currently no cure for AD, it is important to consider the potential psychological impact of an early diagnosis. In addition, counselling before biomarker sampling and during diagnosis disclosure is vital to guarantee that the patients have all the information necessary and their queries are addressed in a sensitive manner. Here, we illustrate (using a clinical vignette) current challenges of diagnosis and discuss some of the benefits and challenges of early diagnosis in AD including the value of biomarkers in combination with clinical evaluation. Lastly, some guidelines for disclosing early diagnosis of AD are provided based on our experiences.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Cerebrospinal fluid; Early diagnosis; Neuroimaging; Patient management; Psychological impact of biomarker testing,,"Nasreddine, Z; Garibotto, V; Kyaga, S; Padovani, A"
Cerebrospinal fluid kappa free light chains for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: A consensus statement.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is of utmost importance for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis (MS). Evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis proves the inflammatory nature of the disease, increases diagnostic certainty and substitutes for dissemination in time according to current diagnostic criteria. The gold standard to determine intrathecal IgG synthesis is the detection of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands (OCBs). However, advances in laboratory methods brought up κ-free light chains (FLCs) as a new biomarker, which are produced in excess over intact immunoglobulins and accumulate in CSF in the case of central nervous system-derived inflammation. Overwhelming evidence showed a high diagnostic accuracy of intrathecal κ-FLC synthesis in MS with sensitivity and specificity of approximately 90% similar to OCB. κ-FLCs have advantages as its detection is fast, easy, cost-effective, reliable, rater-independent and returning quantitative results which might also improve the value of predicting MS disease activity. An international panel of experts in MS and CSF diagnostics developed a consensus of all participants. Six recommendations are given for establishing standard CSF evaluation in patients suspected of having MS. The panel recommended to include intrathecal κ-FLC synthesis in the next revision of MS diagnostic criteria as an additional tool to measure intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.",2023,Cerebrospinal fluid; biomarker; clinically isolated syndrome; consensus; diagnosis; disease activity; index; kappa-free light chains; multiple sclerosis; prediction,Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains; Immunoglobulin G; Biomarkers; Sensitivity and Specificity; Oligoclonal Bands,"Hegen, H; Arrambide, G; Gnanapavan, S; Kaplan, B; Khalil, M; Saadeh, R; Teunissen, C; Tumani, H; Villar, LM; Willrich, MAV; Zetterberg, H; Deisenhammer, F"
Determinants of approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor response outcomes in Alzheimer's disease: relevance for precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) are the global standard of care for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and show significant positive effects in neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Although experimental and large-scale clinical evidence indicates the potential long-term efficacy of ChEI, primary outcomes are generally heterogeneous across outpatient clinics and regional healthcare systems. Sub-optimal dosing or slow tapering, heterogeneous guidelines about the timing for therapy initiation (prodromal versus dementia stages), healthcare providers' ambivalence to treatment, lack of disease awareness, delayed medical consultation, prescription of ChEI in non-AD cognitive disorders, contribute to the negative outcomes. We present an evidence-based overview of determinants, spanning genetic, molecular, and large-scale networks, involved in the response to ChEI in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A comprehensive understanding of cerebral and retinal cholinergic system dysfunctions along with ChEI response predictors in AD is crucial since disease-modifying therapies will frequently be prescribed in combination with ChEI. Therapeutic algorithms tailored to genetic, biological, clinical (endo)phenotypes, and disease stages will help leverage inter-drug synergy and attain optimal combined response outcomes, in line with the precision medicine model.",2023,Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid-β; Basal forebrain; Cholinergic system; Disease-modifying,Humans; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Alzheimer Disease; Acetylcholinesterase; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Precision Medicine,"Lista, S; Vergallo, A; Teipel, SJ; Lemercier, P; Giorgi, FS; Gabelle, A; Garaci, F; Mercuri, NB; Babiloni, C; Gaire, BP; Koronyo, Y; Koronyo-Hamaoui, M; Hampel, H; Nisticò, R"

Proinflammatory IL-17 levels in serum/cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative diseases: a meta-analysis study.,"IL-17 is one of the major proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathophysiology of various chronic inflammatory diseases. However, a clear association between the levels of IL-17 and various neurodegenerative diseases is inconclusive due to lack of consistent results reported in several studies. Therefore, we designed and performed a meta-analysis study to assess the levels of IL-17 cytokine in various neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this meta-analysis study was to assess the level of IL-17 in cerebrospinal fluid/serum of the patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. An extensive search was performed on electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to find out the relevant studies for analysis. The quality of selected studies was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort and case control studies. The standardized mean difference of level of IL-17 in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and control was calculated using RevMan 5 software. A significant increase in the level of serum IL-17 was found to in the patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (p = 0.001) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (p = 0.009), whereas IL-17 level in serum of Parkinson's disease (p = 0.22), multiple sclerosis (p = 0.09), and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS patients (p = 0.34) was not found to be significant.

Cerebrospinal fluid glucose is not altered in patients with dementia.,"Studies have shown that the pathological changes of many dementia disorders begin several years before clinical onset. A connection between some of these pathophysiological changes and brain hypometabolism, seen in dementia disorders, is well established. Glucose is transported from the blood into the interstitial space, and the decreased demand for glucose by the degenerating brain tissue may thereby mirror increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose. In this study, the levels of CSF and plasma glucose and the CSF/plasma glucose ratio were investigated in a large cohort from a mixed memory clinic population in order to evaluate its diagnostic potential.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Frontotemporal dementia; Glucose; Plasma; Vascular dementia,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Blood Glucose; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Frontotemporal Dementia,"Jensen, CS; Gleerup, HS; Musaeus, CS; Hasselbalch, SG; Høgh, P; Waldemar, G; Simonsen, AH"

Lifelong experiences as a proxy of cognitive reserve moderate the association between connectivity and cognition in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with alterations in functional connectivity (FC) of the brain. The FC underpinnings of CR, that is, lifelong experiences, are largely unknown. Resting-state FC and structural MRI were performed in 76 CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) negative healthy controls and 152 Aβ positive individuals as an AD spectrum cohort (ADS; 55 with subjective cognitive decline, SCD; 52 with mild cognitive impairment; 45 with AD dementia). Following a region-of-interest (ROI) FC analysis, intrinsic network connectivity within the default-mode network (INC-DMN) and anti-correlation in INC between the DMN and dorsal attention network (DMN:DAN) were obtained as composite scores. CR was estimated by education and Lifetime Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ). The association between INC-DMN and MEM was attenuated by higher LEQ scores in the entire ADS group, particularly in SCD. In ROI analyses, higher LEQ scores were associated with higher FC within the DMN in ADS group. INC-DMN remains relatively intact despite memory decline in individuals with higher lifetime activity estimates, supporting a role for functional networks in maintaining cognitive function in AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive reserve; Default-mode network; Functional MRI; Lifelong experiences; Neural reserve,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Reserve; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Ersoezlue, E; Rauchmann, BS; Schneider-Axmann, T; Wagner, M; Ballarini, T; Tato, M; Utecht, J; Kurz, C; Papazov, B; Guersel, S; Burow, L; Koller, G; Stöcklein, S; Keeser, D; Bartels, C; Brosseron, F; Buerger, K; Cetindag, AC; Dechent, P; Dobisch, L; Ewers, M; Fliessbach, K; Frommann, I; Haynes, JD; Heneka, MT; Janowitz, D; Kilimann, I; Kleinedam, L; Laske, C; Maier, F; Metzger, CD; Munk, MH; Peters, O; Preis, L; Priller, J; Ramirez, A; Roeske, S; Roy, N; Scheffler, K; Schneider, A; Spottke, A; Spruth, EJ; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Wolfsgruber, S; Yakupov, R; Duezel, E; Jessen, F; Perneczky, R"
Genetic risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder predicts cognitive decline and development of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in cognitively unimpaired older adults.,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) persists in older age and is postulated as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, these findings rely primarily on electronic health records and can present biased estimates of disease prevalence. An obstacle to investigating age-related cognitive decline in ADHD is the absence of large-scale studies following patients with ADHD into older age. Alternatively, this study aimed to determine whether genetic liability for ADHD, as measured by a well-validated ADHD polygenic risk score (ADHD-PRS), is associated with cognitive decline and the development of AD pathophysiology in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. We calculated a weighted ADHD-PRS in 212 CU individuals without a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (55-90 years).

How far is the goal of applying β-amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with standardization of measurements?,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid (Aβ) is important for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the cohort distributions and cut-off values have large variation across different analytical assays, kits, and laboratories. In this review, we summarize the cut-off values and diagnostic performance for CSF Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, and explore the important effect factors. Based on the Alzheimer's Association external quality control program (AAQC program), the peer group coefficient of variation of manual ELISA assays for CSF Aβ1-42 was unsatisfied (>20%). Fully automated platforms with better performance have recently been developed, but still not widely applied. In 2020, the certified reference material (CRM) for CSF Aβ1-42 was launched; however, the AAQC 2021-round results did not show effective improvements. Thus, further development and popularization of CRM for CSF Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 are urgently required. Standardizing the diagnostic procedures of AD and related status and the pre-analytical protocols of CSF samples, improving detection performance of analytical assays, and popularizing the application of fully automated platforms are also important for the establishment of uniform cut-off values. Moreover, each laboratory should verify the applicability of uniform cut-off values, and evaluate whether it is necessary to establish its own population- and assay-specific cut-off values.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Cut-off value; β-amyloid,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments; Reference Standards; tau Proteins,"Zou, Y; Yu, S; Ma, X; Ma, C; Mao, C; Mu, D; Li, L; Gao, J; Qiu, L"
Arachnoid granulations are lymphatic conduits that communicate with bone marrow and dura-arachnoid stroma.,"Arachnoid granulations (AG) are poorly investigated. Historical reports suggest that they regulate brain volume by passively transporting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into dural venous sinuses. Here, we studied the microstructure of cerebral AG in humans with the aim of understanding their roles in physiology. We discovered marked variations in AG size, lobation, location, content, and degree of surface encapsulation. High-resolution microscopy shows that AG consist of outer capsule and inner stromal core regions. The fine and porous framework suggests uncharacterized functions of AG in mechanical CSF filtration. Moreover, internal cytokine and immune cell enrichment imply unexplored neuroimmune properties of these structures that localize to the brain-meningeal lymphatic interface. Dramatic age-associated changes in AG structure are additionally identified. This study depicts for the first time microscopic networks of internal channels that communicate with perisinus spaces, suggesting that AG subserve important functions as transarachnoidal flow passageways.

Role of non‑coding RNAs as biomarkers and the application of omics technologies in Alzheimer's disease (Review).,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has a significant association with age. Despite its increasing incidence in the population, the etiology of the disease remains poorly understood, and there are currently no effective treatments readily available. The main genes that are associated with AD are the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin‑1 and presenilin‑2, as well as the apolipoprotein E gene. In addition to genetic factors, a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors are equally characterized as risk factors for the development of AD, while non‑coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and other epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in their detrimental effects. Multiple types of ncRNAs, such as microRNAs, circular RNAs, Piwi‑interacting RNAs and long non‑coding RNAs are being increasingly implicated in AD. Alterations in ncRNAs can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid, as well in as the brain, highlighting these as promising biomarkers for the detection and treatment of AD. Developments in high‑throughput technologies have led to the so‑called 'omics' era, which involves the collection of big data and information at both molecular and protein levels, while combining the development of novel computational and statistical tools capable of analyzing and filtering such data.

Predicting time-to-conversion for dementia of Alzheimer's type using multi-modal deep survival analysis.,"Dementia of Alzheimer's Type (DAT) is a complex disorder influenced by numerous factors, and it is difficult to predict individual progression trajectory from normal or mildly impaired cognition to DAT.

Our study demonstrated that CDC data outperform genetic or MRI data in predicting DAT time-to-conversion for subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). On the other hand, genetic data provided the most predictive power for subjects with Normal Cognition (NC) at the time of the visit.

Benzodiazepines in Alzheimer's disease: beneficial or detrimental effects.,"Dementia is considered a clinical syndrome characterized by cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. AD is linked with the turbulence of diverse neurotransmitters including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Notably, GABA in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid was reduced in AD. Thus, allosteric modulation of the GABA effect by benzodiazepines (BDZs) may improve the clinical outcomes of AD patients. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to reveal the possible role of BDZs on the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes in AD patients. Though BDZs may adversely affect cognitive functions mainly in elderly patients, herein it was postulated that BDZs may have beneficial, neutral, or detrimental effects in AD. Taken together, there is strong controversy regarding the use of BDZs and the risk for the development of AD. Therefore, experimental, preclinical and clinical studies are critical to determine the potential protective or detrimental effects of BDZs on AD neuropathology.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Benzodiazepines; Cognitive dysfunction; Gamma-aminobutyric acid,Humans; Aged; Benzodiazepines; Alzheimer Disease; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Brain; Cognition,"Al-Kuraishy, HM; Al-Gareeb, AI; Saad, HM; Batiha, GE"
Gray matter hypoperfusion is a late pathological event in the course of Alzheimer's disease.,"Several studies have shown decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of hypoperfusion in the disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Combining arterial spin labeling MRI, PET, and CSF biomarkers, we investigated the associations between gray matter (GM)-CBF and the key mechanisms in AD including amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology, synaptic and axonal degeneration. Further, we applied a disease progression modeling to characterize the temporal sequence of different AD biomarkers. Lower perfusion was observed in temporo-occipito-parietal cortex in the Aβ-positive cognitively impaired compared to both Aβ-negative and Aβ-positive cognitively unimpaired individuals. In participants along the AD spectrum, GM-CBF was associated with tau, synaptic and axonal dysfunction, but not Aβ in similar cortical regions. Axonal degeneration was further associated with hypoperfusion in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Disease progression modeling revealed that GM-CBF disruption Followed the abnormality of biomarkers of Aβ, tau and brain atrophy. These findings indicate that tau tangles and neurodegeneration are more closely connected with GM-CBF changes than Aβ pathology. Although subjected to the sensitivity of the employed neuroimaging techniques and the modeling approach, these findings suggest that hypoperfusion might not be an early event associated with the build-up of Aβ in preclinical phase of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; arterial spin labeling; cerebral blood flow; neurodegeneration; tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gray Matter; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Disease Progression,"Ahmadi, K; Pereira, JB; Berron, D; Vogel, J; Ingala, S; Strandberg, OT; Janelidze, S; Barkhof, F; Pfeuffer, J; Knutsson, L; van Westen, D; Palmqvist, S; Mutsaerts, HJ; Hansson, O"
Cell-free DNA-based liquid biopsies in neurology.,"This article reviews recent developments in the application of cell-free DNA-based liquid biopsies to neurological diseases. Over the past few decades, an explosion of interest in the use of accessible biofluids to identify and track molecular disease has revolutionized the fields of oncology, prenatal medicine and others. More recently, technological advances in signal detection have allowed for informative analysis of biofluids that are typically sparse in cells and other circulating components, such as CSF. In parallel, advancements in epigenetic profiling have allowed for novel applications of liquid biopsies to diseases without characteristic mutational profiles, including many degenerative, autoimmune, inflammatory, ischaemic and infectious disorders. These events have paved the way for a wide array of neurological conditions to benefit from enhanced diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment abilities through the use of liquid biomarkers: a 'liquid biopsy' approach. This review includes an overview of types of liquid biopsy targets with a focus on circulating cell-free DNA, methods used to identify and probe potential liquid biomarkers, and recent applications of such biomarkers to a variety of complex neurological conditions including CNS tumours, stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and neuroinfectious disease. Finally, the challenges of translating liquid biopsies to use in clinical neurology settings-and the opportunities for improvement in disease management that such translation may provide-are discussed.",2023,cfDNA; epigenetics; liquid biopsy; methylation; neurology,"Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; Biomarkers, Tumor; Liquid Biopsy; Mutation; Neurology","Gaitsch, H; Franklin, RJM; Reich, DS"

Overview of the blood biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: Promises and challenges.,"The increasing number of people with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant psychological and financial cost to the world population. Accurate detection of the earliest phase of preclinical AD is of major importance for the success of preventive and therapeutic strategies (Cullen et al., 2021). Advances in analytical techniques have been essential for the development of sensitive, specific and reliable diagnostic tests for AD biomarkers in biological fluids (cerebrospinal fluid and blood). Blood biomarkers hold promising potential for early and minimally invasive detection of AD, but also for differential diagnosis of dementia and for monitoring the course of the disease. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of current blood biomarkers of AD, from tau proteins and amyloid peptides to biomarkers of neuronal degeneration and inflammation, reactive and metabolic factors. We thus discuss the informative value of currently candidate blood biomarkers and their potential to be integrated into clinical practice for the management of AD in the near future.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Biomarkers; Blood; Diagnosis,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Diagnosis, Differential","Delaby, C; Hirtz, C; Lehmann, S"

Dysfunction of norepinephrine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's dementia - A review with meta-analysis.,"Some studies point locus coeruleus cell loss, the central nervous system main source of norepinephrine, to be one of the earliest neuropathological events of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are conflicting reports regarding the level of norepinephrine and its metabolites (3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) and 3,4 -dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL)) in AD patients. Uncover these alterations may be a key factor for understanding cognitive deficits and AD pathology. We review the literature that compare norepinephrine and its metabolites between AD patients and non-demented controls. A meta-analysis did not reveal significant statistical differences, but there was a trend towards a lower level of norepinephrine of AD, with almost no difference in MHPG in the cerebrospinal fluid. Regarding MHPG in plasma, DHPG and DOPEGAL we only performed a qualitative analyse due to the small or absent number of studies. These findings point to a decrease in norepinephrine, what is in line with locus coeluleus cell loss in AD. The absence of statistical difference and an equal level of MHGP could indicate a compensatory mechanism.",2023,"3,4 -dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL); 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG); 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG); Alzheimer disease; Catecholamine; Dementia; Meta-analysis; Norepinephrine",Humans; Norepinephrine; Methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol; Alzheimer Disease,"Portela Moreira, I; Henriques, T; Vieira-Coelho, MA; Guimarães, J"
CSF peptides from VGF and other markers enhance prediction of MCI to AD progression using the ATN framework.,"The amyloid beta, tau, neurodegenerative markers framework has been proposed to serve as a system to classify and combine biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid AT (amyloid beta and tau)-based biomarkers have a well-established track record to distinguish AD from control subjects and to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, there is not an established non-tau based neurodegenerative (""N"") marker from CSF. Here, we examine the ability of several candidate peptides in the CSF to serve as ""N"" markers to both classify disease state and predict MCI to AD conversion. We observed that although many putative N markers involved in synaptic processing and neuroinflammation were able to, when examined in isolation, distinguish MCI converters from non-converters, a derivative from VGF, when combined with AT markers, most strongly enhanced prediction of MCI to AD conversion. Low CSF VGF levels were also predictive of MCI to dementia conversion in the setting of normal AT markers, suggesting that it may serve as a very early predictor of dementia conversion. Other markers derived from neuronal pentraxin 2, GAP-43 and a 14-3-3 protein were also able to enhance MCI to AD prediction when used as a marker of neurodegeneration, but VGF had the highest predictive capacity. Thus, we propose that low levels of VGF in CSF may serve as ""N"" in the amyloid beta, tau, neurodegenerative markers framework to enhance the prediction of MCI to AD conversion.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Biomarker; CSF; GAP43; Mild cognitive impairment; NPTX2; VGF,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Nerve Growth Factors; Peptide Fragments; tau Proteins,"Llano, DA; Devanarayan, P; Devanarayan, V"

Association between the LRP1B and APOE loci and the development of Parkinson's disease dementia.,"Parkinson's disease is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Although predominantly a motor disorder, cognitive impairment and dementia are important features of Parkinson's disease, particularly in the later stages of the disease. However, the rate of cognitive decline varies among Parkinson's disease patients, and the genetic basis for this heterogeneity is incompletely understood. To explore the genetic factors associated with rate of progression to Parkinson's disease dementia, we performed a genome-wide survival meta-analysis of 3923 clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease cases of European ancestry from four longitudinal cohorts. In total, 6.7% of individuals with Parkinson's disease developed dementia during study follow-up, on average 4.4 ± 2.4 years from disease diagnosis. We have identified the APOE ε4 allele as a major risk factor for the conversion to Parkinson's disease dementia [hazard ratio = 2.41 (1.94-3.00), P = 2.32 × 10-15], as well as a new locus within the ApoE and APP receptor LRP1B gene [hazard ratio = 3.23 (2.17-4.81), P = 7.07 × 10-09]. In a candidate gene analysis, GBA variants were also identified to be associated with higher risk of progression to dementia [hazard ratio = 2.02 (1.21-3.32), P = 0.007]. CSF biomarker analysis also implicated the amyloid pathway in Parkinson's disease dementia, with significantly reduced levels of amyloid β42 (P = 0.0012) in Parkinson's disease dementia compared to Parkinson's disease without dementia. These results identify a new candidate gene associated with faster conversion to dementia in Parkinson's disease and suggest that amyloid-targeting therapy may have a role in preventing Parkinson's disease dementia.",2023,Parkinson’s disease; dementia; genome-wide; survival,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Dementia; Cognitive Dysfunction; Apolipoproteins E; Biomarkers; Receptors, LDL","Real, R; Martinez-Carrasco, A; Reynolds, RH; Lawton, MA; Tan, MMX; Shoai, M; Corvol, JC; Ryten, M; Bresner, C; Hubbard, L; Brice, A; Lesage, S; Faouzi, J; Elbaz, A; Artaud, F; Williams, N; Hu, MTM; Ben-Shlomo, Y; Grosset, DG; Hardy, J; Morris, HR"
Metal-organic frameworks: A promising option for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide is one of the main characteristic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous clinical investigations have proposed that unusual concentrations of this biomarker in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and brain tissue are closely associated with the AD progression. Therefore, the critical point of early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AD is to monitor the levels of Aβ. In view of the potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for diagnosing and treating the AD, much attention has been focused in recent years.

Blood-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: a mini-review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and has far reaching consequences for patients and their caregivers. Early detection and treatment are key factors in limiting the impact of the disease. However, a definitive diagnosis of AD requires an examination of brain tissue during an autopsy. Although a plethora of biomarkers such as neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are available, their utility is limited to research due to their poor reach and prohibitive cost. In order for biomarkers to be widely used, they need to be accessible, affordable, and conducive for the patient population or disease stage. Blood-based biomarkers may not only be less expensive and more accessible compared to neuroimaging or CSF tests, but they are also preferred by patients with AD as they are much less invasive. In this mini-review article, we expand on the rationale for the use of blood-based biomarkers, review currently available biomarkers and discuss the need for the standardization of these biomarkers. We contrast the blood-based biomarkers with other available biomarkers and discuss the advantages of using a panel of blood-based biomarkers to strengthen their accuracy.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Blood-based biomarkers; CSF; Neuroimaging,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Brain; Early Diagnosis; Neuroimaging; tau Proteins,"Padala, SP; Newhouse, PA"

The induction of ferroptosis in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.,"Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a common neurological disease characterized by the disordered secretion of cerebrospinal fluid from the choroid plexus, ventricular dilation, and increased intracranial pressure after hemorrhage. Although these pathological processes are well established, the effective biomarkers for the diagnosis of PHH are still limited, largely because the underlying mechanisms-including cell death in the choroid plexus-are not well defined. Ferroptosis, a newly recognized type of programmed cell death, has been found to play a key role in a variety of pathologic conditions and diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. However, whether ferroptosis is induced in PHH is still unknown. In the current study, a rat model of PHH was established to investigate the induction of ferroptosis in PHH. Along with defects in memory and cognition, we observed that rats with experimentally induced PHH also demonstrated lipid peroxidation (a key marker of ferroptosis), as well as a significant increase and a significant decrease in two ferroptosis-specific genes, ACSL4 and SLC7A11, respectively. Thus, ferroptosis may serve as an auxiliary indicator for the diagnosis of PHH.",2023,Choroid plexus; Ferroptosis; Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus,Rats; Animals; Ferroptosis; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Hydrocephalus; Choroid Plexus; Biomarkers,"Meng, Z; Liu, C; Chen, C; Di, F; Zhang, S; Liang, X; Li, M"
Plasma Phosphorylated Tau at Threonine 181 and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer Disease.,"Plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), a well-validated marker of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologic change, could be a more efficient way to diagnose AD than invasive or expensive biomarkers requiring CSF or PET. In some individuals, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are the earliest manifestation of AD, observed in advance of clear cognitive decline. However, the few studies assessing AD biomarkers in association with NPS have often had imprecision in capturing behavioral symptoms that represent sequelae of neurodegenerative disease. Thus, the mild behavioral impairment (MBI) construct was developed, framing NPS in a way to improve the precision of risk estimates for disease. MBI core criteria stipulate that NPS emerge de novo in later life and persist for at least 6 months. Here, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, we investigated associations of MBI with p-tau181, neuropsychological test performance, and incident AD.",2023,,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Neuropsychological Tests; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Ghahremani, M; Wang, M; Chen, HY; Zetterberg, H; Smith, E; Ismail, Z"
Targeting amyloid proteins for clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.,"Abnormal aggregation and accumulation of pathological amyloid proteins such as amyloid-β, Tau, and α-synuclein play key pathological roles and serve as histological hallmarks in different neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, various post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been identified on pathological amyloid proteins and are subjected to change during disease progression. Given the central role of amyloid proteins in NDs, tremendous efforts have been made to develop amyloid-targeting strategies for clinical diagnosis and molecular classification of NDs. In this review, we summarize two major strategies for targeting amyloid aggregates, with a focus on the trials in AD diagnosis. The first strategy is a positron emission tomography (PET) scan of protein aggregation in the brain. We mainly focus on introducing the development of small-molecule PET tracers for specifically recognizing pathological amyloid fibrils. The second strategy is the detection of PTM biomarkers on amyloid proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. We discuss the pathological roles of different PTMs in diseases and how we can use the PTM profile of amyloid proteins for clinical diagnosis. Finally, we point out the potential technical challenges of these two strategies, and outline other potential strategies, as well as a combination of multiple strategies, for molecular diagnosis of NDs.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid aggregation; Biomarker; Clinical diagnosis; Neurodegenerative diseases; Positron emission tomography (PET) tracer; Post-translational modification; Tau,,"Zhang, S; Dong, H; Bian, J; Li, D; Liu, C"

CSF IL-8 Associated with Response to Gene Therapy in a Case Series of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.,"Gene therapies have greatly changed the outlook in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and this disorder provides a rare opportunity to study longitudinal biomarker changes correlated with reduced disease burden and improved clinical outcomes. Recent work suggests clinical response to correlate with declining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the neurodegenerative marker neurofilament light chain (NfL) in children receiving serial anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy. However, change in CSF NfL levels is no longer a practical biomarker as more children undergo single-dose gene replacement therapy. Here we leverage serial CSF samples (median of 4 per child) collected in 13 children with SMA undergoing anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy to characterize the longitudinal profiles of NfL as well as inflammatory and neuronal proteins. In contrast to neurodegeneration in adults, we found NfL levels to first decrease following initiation of treatment but then increase upon further treatment and improved motor functions. We then examined additional CSF inflammatory and neuronal markers for linear association with motor function during SMA treatment. We identified longitudinal IL-8 levels to inversely correlate with motor functions determined by clinical examination (F(1, 47) = 12.903, p = 0.001) or electromyography in the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (p = 0.064). In keeping with this, lower baseline IL-8 levels were associated with better longitudinal outcomes, even though this difference diminished over 2 years in the younger group. We thus propose CSF IL-8 as a biomarker for baseline function and short-term treatment response in SMA, and a candidate biomarker for future treatment trials in other neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,CHOP-INTEND; Interleukin-8; Motor CMAP; Neurofilament light chain; Nusinersen; Weight,"Child; Humans; Biomarkers; Genetic Therapy; Interleukin-8; Muscular Atrophy, Spinal; Oligonucleotides; Oligonucleotides, Antisense","Verma, S; Perry, K; Razdan, R; Howell, JC; Dawson, AL; Hu, WT"
Cholinergic white matter pathways along the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Previous studies have shown that the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert and its white matter projections are affected in Alzheimer's disease dementia and mild cognitive impairment. However, it is still unknown whether these alterations can be found in individuals with subjective cognitive decline, and whether they are more pronounced than changes found in conventional brain volumetric measurements. To address these questions, we investigated microstructural alterations of two major cholinergic pathways in individuals along the Alzheimer's disease continuum using an in vivo model of the human cholinergic system based on neuroimaging. We included 402 participants (52 Alzheimer's disease, 66 mild cognitive impairment, 172 subjective cognitive decline and 112 healthy controls) from the Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study. We modelled the cholinergic white matter pathways with an enhanced diffusion neuroimaging pipeline that included probabilistic fibre-tracking methods and prior anatomical knowledge. The integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was compared between stages of the Alzheimer's disease continuum, in the whole cohort and in a CSF amyloid-beta stratified subsample. The discriminative power of the integrity of the pathways was compared to the conventional volumetric measures of hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. A multivariate model was used to investigate the role of these pathways in relation to cognitive performance. We found that the integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was significantly reduced in all stages of the Alzheimer's disease continuum, including individuals with subjective cognitive decline. The differences involved posterior cholinergic white matter in the subjective cognitive decline stage and extended to anterior frontal white matter in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia stages. Both cholinergic pathways and conventional volumetric measures showed higher predictive power in the more advanced stages of the disease, i.e. mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia. In contrast, the integrity of cholinergic pathways was more informative in distinguishing subjective cognitive decline from healthy controls, as compared with the volumetric measures. The multivariate model revealed a moderate contribution of the cholinergic white matter pathways but not of volumetric measures towards memory tests in the subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cholinergic white matter pathways are altered already in subjective cognitive decline individuals, preceding the more widespread alterations found in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The integrity of the cholinergic pathways identified the early stages of Alzheimer's disease better than conventional volumetric measures such as hippocampal volume or volume of cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF markers; MRI; cholinergic system; nucleus basalis of Meynert,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; White Matter; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cholinergic Agents,"Nemy, M; Dyrba, M; Brosseron, F; Buerger, K; Dechent, P; Dobisch, L; Ewers, M; Fliessbach, K; Glanz, W; Goerss, D; Heneka, MT; Hetzer, S; Incesoy, EI; Janowitz, D; Kilimann, I; Laske, C; Maier, F; Munk, MH; Perneczky, R; Peters, O; Preis, L; Priller, J; Rauchmann, BS; Röske, S; Roy, N; Scheffler, K; Schneider, A; Schott, BH; Spottke, A; Spruth, EJ; Wagner, M; Wiltfang, J; Yakupov, R; Eriksdotter, M; Westman, E; Stepankova, O; Vyslouzilova, L; Düzel, E; Jessen, F; Teipel, SJ; Ferreira, D"

Blood plasma protein profiles of neuropsychiatric symptoms and related cognitive decline in older people.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) severely affect patients and their caregivers, and are associated with worse long-term outcomes. This study tested the hypothesis that altered protein levels in blood plasma could serve as biomarkers of NPS; and that altered protein levels are associated with persisting NPS and cognitive decline over time. We performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal study in older subjects with cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired in a memory clinic setting. NPS were recorded through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) while cognitive and functional impairment was assessed using the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SoB) score at baseline and follow-up visits. Shotgun proteomic analysis based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted in blood plasma samples, identifying 420 proteins. The presence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology was determined by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Eighty-five subjects with a mean age of 70 (±7.4) years, 62% female and 54% with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia were included. We found 15 plasma proteins with altered baseline levels in participants with NPS (NPI-Q score > 0). Adding those 15 proteins to a reference model based on clinical data (age, CDR-SoB) significantly improved the prediction of NPS (from receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC] 0.75 to AUC 0.91, p = 0.004) with a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 74%. The identified proteins additionally predicted both persisting NPS and cognitive decline at follow-up visits. The observed associations were independent of the presence of AD pathology. Using proteomics, we identified a panel of specific blood proteins associated with current and future NPS, and related cognitive decline in older people. These findings show the potential of untargeted proteomics to identify blood-based biomarkers of pathological alterations relevant for NPS and related clinical disease progression.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia; biomarkers; cognitive decline; neuropsychiatric symptoms; proteomics,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Proteomics; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Blood Proteins; Biomarkers,"Rabl, M; Clark, C; Dayon, L; Bowman, GL; Popp, J"
Quantitative systems pharmacology model of the amyloid pathway in Alzheimer's disease: Insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of clinical candidates.,"Despite considerable investment into potential therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD), currently approved treatment options are limited. Predictive modeling using quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) can be used to guide the design of clinical trials in AD. This study developed a QSP model representing amyloid beta (Aβ) pathophysiology in AD. The model included mechanisms of Aβ monomer production and aggregation to form insoluble fibrils and plaques; the transport of soluble species between the compartments of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma; and the pharmacokinetics, transport, and binding of monoclonal antibodies to targets in the three compartments. Ordinary differential equations were used to describe these processes quantitatively. The model components were calibrated to data from the literature and internal studies, including quantitative data supporting the underlying AD biology and clinical data from clinical trials for anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) aducanumab, crenezumab, gantenerumab, and solanezumab. The model was developed for an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele carrier and tested for an APOE ɛ4 noncarrier. Results indicate that the model is consistent with data on clinical Aβ accumulation in untreated individuals and those treated with monoclonal antibodies, capturing increases in Aβ load accurately. This model may be used to investigate additional AD mechanisms and their impact on biomarkers, as well as predict Aβ load at different dose levels for mAbs with known targets and binding affinities. This model may facilitate the design of scientifically enriched and efficient clinical trials by enabling a priori prediction of biomarker dynamics in the brain and CSF.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Network Pharmacology; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Apolipoproteins E","Ramakrishnan, V; Friedrich, C; Witt, C; Sheehan, R; Pryor, M; Atwal, JK; Wildsmith, K; Kudrycki, K; Lee, SH; Mazer, N; Hofmann, C; Fuji, RN; Jin, JY; Ramanujan, S; Dolton, M; Quartino, A"
Selective orexin 1 receptor antagonist SB-334867 aggravated cognitive dysfunction in 3xTg-AD mice.,"Cognitive dysfunction is the main clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous research found that elevated orexin level in the cerebrospinal fluid was closely related to the course of AD, and orexin-A treatment could increase amyloid β protein (Aβ) deposition and aggravate spatial memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, recent research found that dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonist might affect Aβ level and cognitive dysfunction in AD, but the effects of OX1R or OX2R alone is unreported until now. Considering that OX1R is highly expressed in the hippocampus and plays important roles in learning and memory, the effects of OX1R in AD cognitive dysfunction and its possible mechanism should be investigated. In the present study, selective OX1R antagonist SB-334867 was used to block OX1R. Then, different behavioral tests were performed to observe the effects of OX1R blockade on cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice exhibited both Aβ and tau pathology, in vivo electrophysiological recording and western blot were used to investigate the potential mechanism. The results showed that chronic OX1R blockade aggravated the impairments of short-term working memory, long-term spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in 9-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice, increased levels of soluble Aβ oligomers and p-tau, and decreased PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. These results indicate that the detrimental effects of SB-334867 on cognitive behaviors in 3xTg-AD mice are closely related to the decrease of PSD-95 and depression of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) caused by increased Aβ oligomers and p-tau.",2023,Alzheimer's disease (AD); Amyloid β protein (Aβ); Cognition; Orexin 1 receptor (OX1R); Phospho-tau (p-tau); Synaptic plasticity,"Mice; Animals; Female; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Orexins; Mice, Transgenic; Disease Models, Animal; Cognitive Dysfunction; Hippocampus; Orexin Receptor Antagonists; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Gao, WR; Hu, XH; Yu, KY; Cai, HY; Wang, ZJ; Wang, L; Wu, MN"
The Mediating Role of Inflammation in the Relationship Between α-Synuclein and Cognitive Functioning.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that α-synuclein plays a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examined whether α-synuclein level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was associated with cognitive functioning among older adults. We also explored whether this relationship was mediated by proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, along with sIL-6R and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Using a cross-sectional Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; N = 148) sample, we examined the relationship between α-synuclein and participants' performance on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog 13) at baseline. Mediation analyses were utilized, adjusting for age, education, APOEe4, and Geriatric Depression Scale scores. All biological markers were measured in CSF. Participants in the current sample were 58.3% males, 41.7% females, and Caucasian (95.5%); their average education and age were 15.5 (standard deviation [SD] = 2.97) and 74.4 (SD = 7.51) years, respectively. Higher accumulation of α-synuclein was associated with poorer MMSE scores (β = -0.41, standard error [SE] = 1.54, p < .001). This relationship appeared to be mediated by VEGF (β = 0.27, SE = 2.15, p = .025) and IL-6r (β = 0.22, SE = 1.66, p < .026). In addition, α-synuclein was associated with poorer performance on the ADAS-Cog 13 (β = 0.34, p = .005) and mediated by VEGF (β = -0.19, SE = 4.13, p = .025) after adjusting for age, education, APOEe4, and depressive symptoms. α-Synuclein may serve as an additional biomarker for determining poor cognitive functioning. VEGF and IL-6 soluble receptors were significant mediators of the relationship between α-synuclein and cognitive functioning. If confirmed in prospective analyses, these findings can further inform the pathologic cascade and early diagnosis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarker; Cognitive decline; Immune response; α-Synuclein,Male; Female; Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; alpha-Synuclein; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Interleukin-6; Prospective Studies; Cognition; Biomarkers; Inflammation; Neuropsychological Tests,"Dabiri, S; Ramírez Ruiz, MI; Jean-Louis, G; Ntekim, OE; Obisesan, TO; Campbell, AL; Mwendwa, DT"

Dementia with Lewy bodies: Impact of co-pathologies and implications for clinical trial design.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is clinically defined by the presence of visual hallucinations, fluctuations, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavioral disorder, and parkinsonism. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by the presence of Lewy pathology. However, neuropathological studies have demonstrated the high prevalence of coexistent Alzheimer's disease, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and cerebrovascular pathologic cases. Due to their high prevalence and clinical impact on DLB individuals, clinical trials should account for these co-pathologies in their design and selection and the interpretation of biomarkers values and outcomes. Here we discuss the frequency of the different co-pathologies in DLB and their cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical impact. We then evaluate the utility and possible applications of disease-specific and disease-nonspecific biomarkers and how co-pathologies can impact these biomarkers. We propose a framework for integrating multi-modal biomarker fingerprints and step-wise selection and assessment of DLB individuals for clinical trials, monitoring target engagement, and interpreting outcomes in the setting of co-pathologies.",2023,Lewy body dementia; MRI neurodegeneration; PET; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical trials; dementia; dementia with Lewy bodies; parkinsonism; α-synuclein,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Lewy Body Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder; DNA-Binding Proteins,"Toledo, JB; Abdelnour, C; Weil, RS; Ferreira, D; Rodriguez-Porcel, F; Pilotto, A; Wyman-Chick, KA; Grothe, MJ; Kane, JPM; Taylor, A; Rongve, A; Scholz, S; Leverenz, JB; Boeve, BF; Aarsland, D; McKeith, IG; Lewis, S; Leroi, I; Taylor, JP"

Patients carrying the mutation p.R406W in MAPT present with non-conforming phenotypic spectrum.,"The missense mutation p.R406W in microtubule-associated protein tau leads to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with an amnestic, Alzheimer's disease-like phenotype with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In 2003, we described the pedigree of a Belgian family, labelled ADG, with 28 p.R406W patients. Over 18 years follow-up, we extended the family with 10 p.R406W carriers and provided an in-depth clinical description of the patients. Additionally, genetic screening was used to identify p.R406W carriers in Belgian cohorts of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease patients and to calculate p.R406W frequency. In the frontotemporal dementia cohort, we found four p.R406W carriers (n = 647, 0.62%) and three in the Alzheimer's disease cohort (n = 1134, 0.26%). Haplotype sharing analysis showed evidence of a shared haplotype suggesting that they are descendants of a common ancestor. Of the p.R406W patients, we describe characteristics of neuropsychological, imaging and fluid biomarkers as well as neuropathologic examination. Intriguingly, the phenotypic spectrum among the p.R406W patients ranged from typical behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia to clinical Alzheimer's disease, based on CSF biomarker analysis and amyloid PET scan. Heterogeneous overlap syndromes existed in between, with highly common neuropsychiatric symptoms like disinhibition and aggressiveness, which occurred in 100% of frontotemporal dementia and 58% of clinical Alzheimer's disease patients. This was also the case for memory problems, 89% in frontotemporal dementia and 100% in clinical Alzheimer's disease patients. Median age at death was significantly lower in patients with frontotemporal dementia (68 years) compared to clinical Alzheimer's disease patients (79 years), although the sizes of the sub-cohorts are limited and do not allow prognostic predictions. Post-mortem brain analysis of one p.R406W patient with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia revealed frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau pathology. Notably, neuropathological investigation showed only 3R tau isoforms in the absence of 4R tau reactivity, an unusual finding in microtubule-associated protein tau-related frontotemporal lobar degeneration. No traces of amyloid pathology were present. Prevalence of the p.R406W mutation was relatively high in both frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease Belgian patient cohorts. These findings grant new insights into genotype-phenotype correlations of p.R406W carriers. They may help in further unravelling of the pathophysiology of this tauopathy and in facilitating the identification of patients with p.R406W-related frontotemporal lobar degeneration, both in clinical diagnostic and research settings.",2023,MAPT; Alzheimer’s disease; frontotemporal dementia; genotype–phenotype correlations; tauopathy,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Frontotemporal Dementia; tau Proteins; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Mutation; Phenotype; Biomarkers; Pick Disease of the Brain,"Gossye, H; Van Mossevelde, S; Sieben, A; Bjerke, M; Hendrickx Van de Craen, E; van der Zee, J; De Deyn, PP; De Bleecker, J; Versijpt, J; van den Ende, J; Deryck, O; Bourgeois, P; Bier, JC; Goethals, M; Vandenberghe, R; Engelborghs, S; Van Broeckhoven, C"

Mitochondrial DNA variation in Alzheimer's disease reveals a unique microprotein called SHMOOSE.,"Mitochondrial DNA variants have previously associated with disease, but the underlying mechanisms have been largely elusive. Here, we report that mitochondrial SNP rs2853499 associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), neuroimaging, and transcriptomics. We mapped rs2853499 to a novel mitochondrial small open reading frame called SHMOOSE with microprotein encoding potential. Indeed, we detected two unique SHMOOSE-derived peptide fragments in mitochondria by using mass spectrometry-the first unique mass spectrometry-based detection of a mitochondrial-encoded microprotein to date. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SHMOOSE levels in humans correlated with age, CSF tau, and brain white matter volume. We followed up on these genetic and biochemical findings by carrying out a series of functional experiments. SHMOOSE acted on the brain following intracerebroventricular administration, differentiated mitochondrial gene expression in multiple models, localized to mitochondria, bound the inner mitochondrial membrane protein mitofilin, and boosted mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Altogether, SHMOOSE has vast implications for the fields of neurobiology, Alzheimer's disease, and microproteins.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Peptide Fragments; DNA, Mitochondrial; Biomarkers; Micropeptides","Miller, B; Kim, SJ; Mehta, HH; Cao, K; Kumagai, H; Thumaty, N; Leelaprachakul, N; Braniff, RG; Jiao, H; Vaughan, J; Diedrich, J; Saghatelian, A; Arpawong, TE; Crimmins, EM; Ertekin-Taner, N; Tubi, MA; Hare, ET; Braskie, MN; Décarie-Spain, L; Kanoski, SE; Grodstein, F; Bennett, DA; Zhao, L; Toga, AW; Wan, J; Yen, K; Cohen, P"
Biomarkers for dementia in Latin American countries: Gaps and opportunities.,"Limited knowledge on dementia biomarkers in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries remains a serious barrier.

Regarding barriers in LAC, lack of funding appears to undermine the implementation of biomarkers in clinical or research settings, followed by insufficient infrastructure and training. The survey revealed that despite the above barriers, the region holds a great potential to advance dementia biomarkers research.

Head-to-head comparison of 10 plasma phospho-tau assays in prodromal Alzheimer's disease.,"Plasma phospho-tau (p-tau) species have emerged as the most promising blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we performed a head-to-head comparison of p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 measured using 10 assays to detect abnormal brain amyloid-β (Aβ) status and predict future progression to Alzheimer's dementia. The study included 135 patients with baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (mean age 72.4 years; 60.7% women) who were followed for an average of 4.9 years. Seventy-one participants had abnormal Aβ-status (i.e. abnormal CSF Aβ42/40) at baseline; and 45 of these Aβ-positive participants progressed to Alzheimer's dementia during follow-up. P-tau concentrations were determined in baseline plasma and CSF. P-tau217 and p-tau181 were both measured using immunoassays developed by Lilly Research Laboratories (Lilly) and mass spectrometry assays developed at Washington University (WashU). P-tau217 was also analysed using Simoa immunoassay developed by Janssen Research and Development (Janss). P-tau181 was measured using Simoa immunoassay from ADxNeurosciences (ADx), Lumipulse immunoassay from Fujirebio (Fuji) and Splex immunoassay from Mesoscale Discovery (Splex). Both p-tau181 and p-tau231 were quantified using Simoa immunoassay developed at the University of Gothenburg (UGOT). We found that the mass spectrometry-based p-tau217 (p-tau217WashU) exhibited significantly better performance than all other plasma p-tau biomarkers when detecting abnormal Aβ status [area under curve (AUC) = 0.947; Pdiff < 0.015] or progression to Alzheimer's dementia (AUC = 0.932; Pdiff < 0.027). Among immunoassays, p-tau217Lilly had the highest AUCs (0.886-0.889), which was not significantly different from the AUCs of p-tau217Janss, p-tau181ADx and p-tau181WashU (AUCrange 0.835-0.872; Pdiff > 0.09), but higher compared with AUC of p-tau231UGOT, p-tau181Lilly, p-tau181UGOT, p-tau181Fuji and p-tau181Splex (AUCrange 0.642-0.813; Pdiff ≤ 0.029). Correlations between plasma and CSF values were strongest for p-tau217WashU (R = 0.891) followed by p-tau217Lilly (R = 0.755; Pdiff = 0.003 versus p-tau217WashU) and weak to moderate for the rest of the p-tau biomarkers (Rrange 0.320-0.669). In conclusion, our findings suggest that among all tested plasma p-tau assays, mass spectrometry-based measures of p-tau217 perform best when identifying mild cognitive impairment patients with abnormal brain Aβ or those who will subsequently progress to Alzheimer's dementia. Several other assays (p-tau217Lilly, p-tau217Janss, p-tau181ADx and p-tau181WashU) showed relatively high and consistent accuracy across both outcomes. The results further indicate that the highest performing assays have performance metrics that rival the gold standards of Aβ-PET and CSF. If further validated, our findings will have significant impacts in diagnosis, screening and treatment for Alzheimer's dementia in the future.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; blood p-tau; dementia,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Biomarkers,"Janelidze, S; Bali, D; Ashton, NJ; Barthélemy, NR; Vanbrabant, J; Stoops, E; Vanmechelen, E; He, Y; Dolado, AO; Triana-Baltzer, G; Pontecorvo, MJ; Zetterberg, H; Kolb, H; Vandijck, M; Blennow, K; Bateman, RJ; Hansson, O"
Magnetic resonance imaging Locus Coeruleus abnormality in amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment is associated with future progression to dementia.,"Human neuropathological studies indicate that the pontine nucleus Locus Coeruleus (LC) undergoes significant and early degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

Phospho-tau with subthreshold tau-PET predicts increased tau accumulation rates in amyloid-positive individuals.,"Different tau biomarkers become abnormal at different stages of Alzheimer's disease, with CSF phospho-tau typically becoming elevated at subthreshold levels of tau-PET binding. To capitalize on the temporal order of tau biomarker-abnormality and capture the earliest changes of tau accumulation, we implemented an observational study design to examine longitudinal changes in tau-PET, cortical thickness and cognitive decline in amyloid-β-positive individuals with elevated CSF p-tau levels (P+) but subthreshold Tau-PET retention (T-). To this end, individuals without dementia (i.e. cognitively unimpaired or mild cognitive impairment, n = 231) were selected from the BioFINDER-2 study. Amyloid-β-positive (A+) individuals were categorized into biomarker groups based on cut-offs for abnormal CSF p-tau217 and 18F-RO948 (Tau) PET, yielding groups of tau-concordant-negative (A+P-T-; n = 30), tau-discordant (i.e. A+P+T-; n = 48) and tau-concordant-positive (A+P+T+; n = 18) individuals. In addition, 135 amyloid-β-negative, tau-negative, cognitively unimpaired individuals served as controls. Differences in annual change in regional tau-PET, cortical thickness and cognition between the groups were assessed using general linear models, adjusted for age, sex, clinical diagnosis and (for cognitive measures only) education. Mean follow-up time was ∼2 years. Longitudinal increase in tau-PET was faster in the A+P+T- group than in the control and A+P-T- groups across medial temporal and neocortical regions, with the highest accumulation rates in the medial temporal lobe. The A+P+T- group showed a slower rate of increase in tau-PET compared to the A+P+T+ group, primarily in neocortical regions. We did not detect differences in yearly change in cortical thickness or in cognitive decline between the A+P+T- and A+P-T- groups. The A+P+T+ group, however, showed faster cognitive decline compared to all other groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that the A+P+T- biomarker profile in persons without dementia is associated with an isolated effect on increased tau-PET accumulation rates but not on cortical thinning and cognitive decline. While this suggests that the tau-discordant biomarker profile is not strongly associated with short-term clinical decline, this group does represent an interesting population for monitoring the effects of interventions with disease-modifying agents on tau accumulation in early Alzheimer's disease, and for examining the emergence of tau aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. Further, we suggest updating the AT(N) criteria for Alzheimer's disease biomarker classification to APT(N).",2023,Alzheimer; CSF; PET; discordance; tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid; Cognition; Biomarkers,"Groot, C; Smith, R; Stomrud, E; Binette, AP; Leuzy, A; Wuestefeld, A; Wisse, LEM; Palmqvist, S; Mattsson-Carlgren, N; Janelidze, S; Strandberg, O; Ossenkoppele, R; Hansson, O"

Zinc Ameliorates Nogo-A Receptor and Osteocalcin Gene Expression in Memory-Sensitive Rat Hippocampus Impaired by Intracerebroventricular Injection of Streptozotocin.,"Metabolic dysfunction is a critical step in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this progressive neurological disorder, impaired zinc homeostasis has a key role that needs to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zinc deficiency and administration on hippocampal Nogo-A receptor and osteocalcin gene expression in rats injected with intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (icv-STZ). Forty male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups in equal numbers: Sham 1 group received icv artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF); Sham 2 group received icv a CSF and i.p. saline; STZ group received 3 mg/kg icv STZ; STZ-Zn-deficient group received 3 mg/kg icv STZ and fed a zinc-deprived diet; STZ-Zn-supplemented group received 3 mg/kg icv STZ and i.p. zinc sulfate (5 mg/kg/day). Hippocampus tissue samples were taken following the cervical dislocation of the animals under general anesthesia. Nogo-A receptor and osteocalcin gene expression levels were determined by real-time-PCR method. Zinc supplementation attenuated the increase in hippocampal Nogo-A receptor gene expression, which was significantly increased in zinc deficiency. Again, zinc supplementation upregulated the intrinsic protective mechanisms of the brain by activating osteocalcin-expressing cells in the brain. The results of the study show that zinc has critical effects on Nogo-A receptor gene expression and hippocampal osteocalcin gene expression levels in the memory-sensitive rat hippocampus that is impaired by icv-STZ injection. These results are the first to examine the effect of zinc deficiency and supplementation on hippocampal Nogo-A receptor and osteocalcin gene expression in icv-STZ injection in rats.",2023,Hippocampus; Icv-STZ injection; Nogo-A receptor; Osteocalcin; Zinc,"Rats; Male; Animals; Streptozocin; Rats, Wistar; Nogo Proteins; Osteocalcin; Zinc; Alzheimer Disease; Hippocampus; Disease Models, Animal; Maze Learning","Gumus, H; Baltaci, SB; Unal, O; Gulbahce-Mutlu, E; Mogulkoc, R; Baltaci, AK"

Elevated Levels of Naturally-Occurring Autoantibodies Against the Extracellular Domain of p75NTR Aggravate the Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The extracellular domain (p75ECD) of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) antagonizes Aβ neurotoxicity and promotes Aβ clearance in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The impaired shedding of p75ECD is a key pathological process in AD, but its regulatory mechanism is largely unknown. This study was designed to investigate the presence and alterations of naturally-occurring autoantibodies against p75ECD (p75ECD-NAbs) in AD patients and their effects on AD pathology. We found that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) level of p75ECD-NAbs was increased in AD, and negatively associated with the CSF levels of p75ECD. Transgenic AD mice actively immunized with p75ECD showed a lower level of p75ECD and more severe AD pathology in the brain, as well as worse cognitive functions than the control groups, which were immunized with Re-p75ECD (the reverse sequence of p75ECD) and phosphate-buffered saline, respectively.

A review on comparative studies addressing exosome isolation methods from body fluids.,"Exosomes emerged as valuable sources of disease biomarkers and new therapeutic tools. However, extracellular vesicles isolation with exosome-like characteristics from certain biofluids is still challenging which can limit their potential use in clinical settings. While ultracentrifugation-based procedures are the gold standard for exosome isolation from cell cultures, no unique and standardized method for exosome isolation from distinct body fluids exists. The complexity, specific composition, and physical properties of each biofluid constitute a technical barrier to obtain reproducible and pure exosome preparations, demanding a detailed characterization of both exosome isolation and characterization methods. Moreover, some isolation procedures can affect downstream proteomic or RNA profiling analysis. This review compiles and discussed a set of comparative studies addressing distinct exosome isolation methods from human biofluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, serum, saliva, and urine, also focusing on body fluid specific challenges, physical properties, and other potential variation sources. This summarized information will facilitate the choice of exosome isolation methods, based on the type of biological samples available, and hopefully encourage the use of exosomes in translational and clinical research.",2023,Biofluids; Extracellular vesicles; Isolation methods,Humans; Exosomes; Proteomics; Ultracentrifugation; Body Fluids; Cell Culture Techniques,"Martins, TS; Vaz, M; Henriques, AG"

"The Relationships Among Metal Homeostasis, Mitochondria, and Locus Coeruleus in Psychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders: Potential Pathogenetic Mechanism and Therapeutic Implications.","While alterations in the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system are present during early stages of neuropsychiatric disorders, it is unclear what causes these changes and how they contribute to other pathologies in these conditions. Data suggest that the onset of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia is associated with metal dyshomeostasis that causes glial cell mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperactivation in the locus coeruleus. The effect of the overactive locus coeruleus on the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex can be responsible for some of the psychiatric symptoms. Although locus coeruleus overactivation may diminish over time, neuroinflammation-induced alterations are presumably ongoing due to continued metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In early Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction likely induce locus coeruleus hyperactivation, pathological tau or α-synuclein formation, and neurodegeneration, while reduction of glymphatic and cerebrospinal fluid flow might be responsible for β-amyloid aggregation in the olfactory regions before the onset of dementia. It is possible that the overactive noradrenergic system stimulates the apoptosis signaling pathway and pathogenic protein formation, leading to further pathological changes which can occur in the presence or absence of locus coeruleus hypoactivation. Data are presented in this review indicating that although locus coeruleus hyperactivation is involved in pathological changes at prodromal and early stages of these neuropsychiatric disorders, metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction are critical factors in maintaining ongoing neuropathology throughout the course of these conditions. The proposed mechanistic model includes multiple pharmacological sites that may be targeted for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders commonly.",2023,Locus coeruleus; Metal dyshomeostasis; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Neuropathology; Neuropsychopharmacology; Psychiatric and neurological disorders,"Humans; Locus Coeruleus; Depressive Disorder, Major; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Norepinephrine; Homeostasis; Mitochondria","Nakagawa, Y; Yamada, S"

Biomarker A+T-: is this Alzheimer's disease or not? A combined CSF and pathology study.,"The biological definition of Alzheimer's disease using CSF biomarkers requires abnormal levels of both amyloid (A) and tau (T). However, biomarkers and corresponding cutoffs may not always reflect the presence or absence of pathology. Previous studies suggest that up to 32% of individuals with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease show normal CSF p-tau levels in vivo, but these studies are sparse and had small sample sizes. Therefore, in three independent autopsy cohorts, we studied whether or not CSF A+T- excluded Alzheimer's disease based on autopsy. We included 215 individuals, for whom ante-mortem CSF collection and autopsy had been performed, from three cohorts: (i) the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC) [n = 80, 37 (46%) Alzheimer's disease at autopsy, time between CSF collection and death 4.5 ± 2.9 years]; (ii) the Antwerp Dementia Cohort (DEM) [n = 92, 84 (91%) Alzheimer's disease at autopsy, time CSF collection to death 1.7 ± 2.3 years]; and (iii) the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [n = 43, 31 (72%) Alzheimer's disease at autopsy, time CSF collection to death 5.1 ± 2.5 years]. Biomarker profiles were based on dichotomized CSF Aβ1-42 and p-tau levels. The accuracy of CSF AT profiles to detect autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease was assessed. Lastly, we investigated whether the concordance of AT profiles with autopsy diagnosis improved when CSF was collected closer to death in 9 (10%) DEM and 30 (70%) ADNI individuals with repeated CSF measurements available. In total, 50-73% of A+T- individuals and 100% of A+T+ individuals had Alzheimer's disease at autopsy. Amyloid status showed the highest accuracy to detect autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the ADC: 88%, 92% and 84%; in the DEM: 87%, 94% and 12%; and in the ADNI cohort: 86%, 90% and 75%, respectively). The addition of CSF p-tau did not further improve these estimates. We observed no differences in demographics or degree of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology between A+T- and A+T+ individuals with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease. All individuals with repeated CSF measurements remained stable in Aβ1-42 status during follow-up. None of the Alzheimer's disease individuals with a normal p-tau status changed to abnormal; however, four (44%) DEM individuals and two (7%) ADNI individuals changed from abnormal to normal p-tau status over time, and all had Alzheimer's disease at autopsy. In summary, we found that up to 73% of A+T- individuals had Alzheimer's disease at autopsy.

According to recent studies, the newly discovered brain lymphatic system was demonstrated to be crucial in the clearance of metabolic macromolecules from the brain. Meningeal lymphatic vessels located in the dura mater drain the fluid, macromolecules, and immune cells from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and transport them, as lymph, to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The lymphatic system provides the perivascular exchange of CSF with interstitial fluid (ISF) and ensures the homeostasis of neuronal interstitial space. In this review, we aim to summarize recent findings on the role of the lymphatic system in AD pathophysiology and discuss possible therapeutic perspectives, targeting the lymphatic clearance mechanisms within the brain.",2023,Dementia; amyloid-β (Aβ); cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); glymphatic system; interstitial fluid (ISF); meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs); perivascular space,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Lymphatic System; Glymphatic System; Extracellular Fluid,"Chachaj, A; Gąsiorowski, K; Szuba, A; Sieradzki, A; Leszek, J"
How Do Abnormalities in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Impact Neuropsychology with Progressing Age?,"The behavior of an individual changes from neonate to elderly due to the development of the central nervous system (CNS). One of the important components of the CNS is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which bathes the brain and spinal cord. CSF has changing properties throughout life, including composition and volume imbalance. However, a specific age group that shows prevailing abnormality- corresponding behavior remains unclear. The objective of this article is to explore how such changes reflect on one's psychological as well as physical processing. Production of CSF could be affected by many factors, including its flow, absorption, volume, and composition. Prenatally, congenital malformations and infections hold the greatest risk of impacting the child's physical and mental growth. In adolescents, transmission of external substances like alcohol or drugs in the cerebrospinal fluid is known to impact severe mood changes that potentially result in suicide and depression. In the adult working population, the influence of stress levels on CSF composition causes anxiety and sleep disorders. Finally, the reduced production of CSF was found to be associated with memory deficits and Alzheimer's disease in the aging group. From the collected evidence, it can be observed that CSF played an important role in behavioral changes and may be associated with neurodegenerations. By linking the CSF abnormalities to the clinical symptoms at different stages of life, it may provide additional information in the diagnosis of diseases that are associated with neuropsychological changes.",2023,Cerebrospinal fluid; abnormalities; age; behavior; brain; central nervous system; neuropsychology,"Adult; Adolescent; Child; Infant, Newborn; Humans; Aged; Neuropsychology; Central Nervous System; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Aging","Joshi, G; Ling, APK; Chye, SM; Koh, RY"
Cerebrospinal Fluid Profile of Lipid Mediators in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops into dementia over a period of several years, during which subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be used as intermediary diagnoses of increasing severity. Chronic neuroinflammation resulting from insufficient resolution is involved in the pathogenesis of AD and is associated with cognitive impairment. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (LMs) that promote the resolution of inflammation may be valuable markers in AD diagnosis and as therapeutic targets. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze pro-resolving and pro-inflammatory LMs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with cognitive impairment ranging from subjective impairment to a diagnosis of AD and correlated to cognition, CSF tau, and β-amyloid. Resolvin (Rv) D4, RvD1, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), maresin 1 (MaR1), and RvE4 were lower in AD and/or MCI compared to SCI.

Blood-brain barrier permeable β-blockers linked to lower risk of Alzheimer's disease in hypertension.,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the pathological accumulation of amyloid-β and tau begins years before symptom onset. Emerging evidence suggests that β-blockers (β-adrenergic antagonists) increase brain clearance of these metabolites by enhancing CSF flow. Our objective was to determine whether β-blocker treatments that easily cross the blood-brain barrier reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to less permeable β-blockers. Data from the Danish national registers were used to identify a retrospective cohort of individuals with hypertension, and those treated with β-blockers were included in the analysis. People with indications for β-blocker use other than hypertension (e.g. heart failure) were only retained in a sensitivity analysis. β-blockers were divided into three permeability groups: low, moderate and high. We used multivariable cause-specific Cox regression to model the effect of β-blocker blood-brain barrier permeability on time to dementia outcomes, adjusting for baseline comorbidities, demographics and socioeconomic variables. Death was modelled as a competing risk. The 10-year standardized absolute risk was estimated as the averaged person-specific risks per treatment. In a cohort of 69 081 (median age = 64.4 years, 64.8% female) people treated with β-blockers for hypertension, highly blood-brain barrier-permeable β-blockers were associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease versus low permeability β-blockers (-0.45%, P < 0.036). This effect was specific to Alzheimer's diagnoses and did not extend to dementia in general. Propensity score analysis matching high and low blood-brain barrier-permeable patients also detected a decreased Alzheimer's risk (-0.92%, P < 0.001) in the high permeability group compared to the low, as did a 1-year landmark analysis (-0.57%, P < 0.029) in which events within the first year of follow-up were ignored as likely unrelated to treatment. Our results suggest that amongst people taking β-blockers for hypertension, treatment with highly blood-brain barrier permeable β-blockers reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to low permeability drugs. Our findings support the hypothesis that highly permeable β-blockers protect against Alzheimer's disease by promoting waste brain metabolite clearance.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; adrenergic antagonists; antihypertensive drugs; blood–brain barrier; glymphatic clearance,Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Retrospective Studies; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Hypertension,"Beaman, EE; Bonde, AN; Larsen, SMU; Ozenne, B; Lohela, TJ; Nedergaard, M; Gíslason, GH; Knudsen, GM; Holst, SC"

Biological Mechanism-based Neurology and Psychiatry: A BACE1/2 and Downstream Pathway Model.,"In oncology, comprehensive omics and functional enrichment studies have led to an extensive profiling of (epi)genetic and neurobiological alterations that can be mapped onto a single tumor's clinical phenotype and divergent clinical phenotypes expressing common pathophysiological pathways. Consequently, molecular pathway-based therapeutic interventions for different cancer typologies, namely tumor type- and site-agnostic treatments, have been developed, encouraging the real-world implementation of a paradigm shift in medicine. Given the breakthrough nature of the new-generation translational research and drug development in oncology, there is an increasing rationale to transfertilize this blueprint to other medical fields, including psychiatry and neurology. In order to illustrate the emerging paradigm shift in neuroscience, we provide a state-of-the-art review of translational studies on the β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) and its most studied downstream effector, neuregulin, which are molecular orchestrators of distinct biological pathways involved in several neurological and psychiatric diseases. This body of data aligns with the evidence of a shared genetic/biological architecture among Alzheimer's disease, schizoaffective disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. To facilitate a forward-looking discussion about a potential first step towards the adoption of biological pathway-based, clinical symptom-agnostic, categorization models in clinical neurology and psychiatry for precision medicine solutions, we engage in a speculative intellectual exercise gravitating around BACE-related science, which is used as a paradigmatic case here. We draw a perspective whereby pathway-based therapeutic strategies could be catalyzed by highthroughput techniques embedded in systems-scaled biology, neuroscience, and pharmacology approaches that will help overcome the constraints of traditional descriptive clinical symptom and syndrome-focused constructs in neurology and psychiatry.",2023,neurology; precision medicine; psychiatry; systems biology; systems pharmacology; β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE),Humans; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Alzheimer Disease; Neurology; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Psychiatry,"Hampel, H; Caruso, G; Nisticò, R; Piccioni, G; Mercuri, NB; Giorgi, FS; Ferrarelli, F; Lemercier, P; Caraci, F; Lista, S; Vergallo, A"

Biobanking for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Challenge for Translational Research and Data Privacy.,"Biobanking has emerged as a strategic challenge to promote knowledge on neurological diseases, by the application of translational research. Due to the inaccessibility of the central nervous system, the advent of biobanks, as structure collecting biospecimens and associated data, are essential to turn experimental results into clinical practice. Findings from basic research, omics sciences, and in silico studies, definitely require validation in clinically well-defined cohorts of patients, even more valuable when longitudinal, or including preclinical and asymptomatic individuals. Finally, collecting biological samples requires a great effort to guarantee respect for transparency and protection of sensitive data of patients and donors. Since the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 has been approved, concerns about the use of data in biomedical research have emerged. In this narrative review, we focus on the essential role of biobanking for translational research on neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we address considerations for biological samples and data collection, the importance of standardization in the preanalytical phase, data protection (ethical and legal) and the role of donors in improving research in this field.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biobank; biological material; biomarkers; cerebrospinal fluid; data protection; diagnosis; neurodegenerative diseases; translational research,"Humans; Translational Research, Biomedical; Biological Specimen Banks; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Privacy; Biomedical Research","Giannella, E; Notarangelo, V; Motta, C; Sancesario, G"
