"Dysregulation of Lipid Metabolism Serves as A Link Between Alzheimer's and Cardiovascular Disease, As Witnessed in A Cross-Sectional Study.","Cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) increase the risk of suffering dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Here, we set out to define specific molecular profiles of CVD in patients with DAT to better understand its relationship, to unravel the mechanisms underlying the high risk of developing DAT in CVD patients and to define new markers of early disease. Plasma samples from patients with DAT, with and without CVD, were analyzed through a multiomics approach, with integration of metabolomics and proteomics datasets using the OmicsNet web-based tool. Metabolomics results showed an enrichment in lipids and lipid-like molecules. Similarly, the most significant cluster identified through proteomics was formed by 5 proteins related to lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism. After integration and functional enrichment, glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation and sphingolipid metabolism were among the most significant functions. Finally, differential expression of ABCA1 and APOH proteins was verified, in an independent cohort also including controls and patients with CVD alone. Both proteins positively correlated with phospho-Tau (181), a classical hallmark of DAT. Different molecular profiles exist in patients with DAT, with and without CVD, with exacerbated alterations in patients in which DAT and CVD co-exist. This information may help to define biomarkers like ABCA1 and APOH that identify patients with cardiovascular dysfunction that are at high risk of developing DAT. Such markers will allow more personalized interventions to be selected, a further step towards precision medicine for individuals whose molecular profiles indicate a distinct response to the same management strategies.",2024,,,"Mourino-Alvarez, L; Juarez-Alia, C; Sastre-Oliva, T; Perales-Sánchez, I; Hernandez-Fernandez, G; Chicano-Galvez, E; Peralbo-Molina, Á; Madruga, F; Blanco-Lopez, E; Tejerina, T; Barderas, MG"

HT_PREDICT: a machine learning-based computational open-source tool for screening HDAC6 inhibitors.,"Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a promising drug target for the treatment of human diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases (in particular, Alzheimer's disease), and multiple sclerosis. Considerable attention is paid to the development of selective non-toxic HDAC6 inhibitors. To this end, we successfully form a set of 3854 compounds and proposed adequate regression QSAR models for HDAC6 inhibitors. The models have been developed using the PubChem, Klekota-Roth, 2D atom pair fingerprints, and RDkit descriptors and the gradient boosting, support vector machines, neural network, and k-nearest neighbours methods. The models are integrated into the developed HT_PREDICT application, which is freely available at https://htpredict.streamlit.app/. In vitro studies have confirmed the predictive ability of the proposed QSAR models integrated into the HT_PREDICT web application. In addition, the virtual screening performed with the HT_PREDICT web application allowed us to propose two promising inhibitors for further investigations.",2024,QSAR; Streamlit; acute toxicity; machine learning; molecular fingerprints; selective inhibitors,"Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Histone Deacetylase 6; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Machine Learning; Humans; Support Vector Machine; Neural Networks, Computer","Tinkov, OV; Osipov, VN; Kolotaev, AV; Khachatryan, DS; Grigorev, VY"
"Effects of glyphosate exposure on intestinal microbiota, metabolism and microstructure: a systematic review.","Glyphosate is the most commercialized herbicide in Brazil and worldwide, and this has become a worrying scenario in recent years. In 2015 glyphosate was classified as potentially carcinogenic by the World Health Organization, which opened avenues for numerous debates about its safe use regarding non-target species' health, including humans. This review aimed to observe the impacts of glyphosate and its formulations on the gut microbiota, as well as on the gut microstructure and animal metabolism. A systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA recommendations, and the search for original articles was performed in Pubmed/Medline, Scopus and Web of Science databases. The risk of bias in the studies was assessed using the SYRCLE strategy. Our findings revealed that glyphosate and its formulations are able to induce intestinal dysbiosis by altering bacterial metabolism, intestinal permeability, and mucus secretion, as well as causing damage to the microvilli and the intestinal lumen. Additionally, immunological, enzymatic and genetic changes were also observed in the animal models. At the metabolic level, damage was observed in lipid and energy metabolism, the circulatory system, cofactor and vitamin metabolism, and replication, repair, and translation processes. In this context, we pointed out that the studies revealed that these alterations, caused by glyphosate-based herbicides, can lead to intestinal and systemic diseases, such as Crohn's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",2024,,,"Ignácio, ADC; Guerra, AMDR; de Souza-Silva, TG; Carmo, MAVD; Paula, HAA"

Cortical thickness and grey-matter volume anomaly detection in individual MRI scans: Comparison of two methods.,"Over the past decades, morphometric analysis of brain MRI has contributed substantially to the understanding of healthy brain structure, development and aging as well as to improved characterisation of disease related pathologies. Certified commercial tools based on normative modeling of these metrics are meanwhile available for diagnostic purposes, but they are cost intensive and their clinical evaluation is still in its infancy. Here we have compared the performance of ""ScanOMetrics"", an open-source research-level tool for detection of statistical anomalies in individual MRI scans, depending on whether it is operated on the output of FreeSurfer or of the deep learning based brain morphometry tool DL + DiReCT. When applied to the public OASIS3 dataset, containing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls (HC), cortical thickness anomalies in patient scans were mainly detected in regions that are known as predilection areas of cortical atrophy in AD, regardless of the software used for extraction of the metrics. By contrast, anomaly detections in HCs were up to twenty-fold reduced and spatially unspecific using both DL + DiReCT and FreeSurfer. Progression of the atrophy pattern with clinical dementia rating (CDR) was clearly observable with both methods. DL + DiReCT provided results in less than 25 min, more than 15 times faster than FreeSurfer. This difference in computation time might be relevant when considering application of this or similar methodology as diagnostic decision support for neuroradiologists.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Brain morphometry; Clinical decision support; MRI; Normative modeling; Personalized medicine,,"Romascano, D; Rebsamen, M; Radojewski, P; Blattner, T; McKinley, R; Wiest, R; Rummel, C"

The New Horizon of Antipsychotics beyond the Classic Dopaminergic Hypothesis-The Case of the Xanomeline-Trospium Combination: A Systematic Review.,"Although the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia explains the effects of all the available antipsychotics in clinical use, there is an increasing need for developing new drugs for the treatment of the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of chronic psychoses. Xanomeline-trospium (KarXT) is a drug combination that is based on the essential role played by acetylcholine in the regulation of cognitive processes and the interactions between this neurotransmitter and other signaling pathways in the central nervous system, with a potential role in the onset of schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and substance use disorders. A systematic literature review that included four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Clarivate/Web of Science, and Google Scholar) and the US National Library of Medicine database for clinical trials detected twenty-one sources referring to fourteen studies focused on KarXT, out of which only four have available results. Based on the results of these trials, the short-term efficacy and tolerability of xanomeline-trospium are good, but more data are needed before this drug combination may be recommended for clinical use. However, on a theoretical level, the exploration of KarXT is useful for increasing the interest of researchers in finding new, non-dopaminergic, antipsychotics that could be used either as monotherapy or as add-on drugs.",2024,Alzheimer’s disorder; acetylcholine; antipsychotics; dopaminergic hypothesis; muscarinic receptors; psychoses; schizophrenia; trospium; xanomeline,,"Vasiliu, O; Budeanu, B; Cătănescu, MȘ"
The Role of Physical Activity in Adjunctive Nursing Management of Neuro-Degenerative Diseases among Older Adults: A Systematic Review of Interventional Studies.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Parkinson's disease pose significant challenges to older adults globally. While pharmacological treatments remain primary, increasing evidence supports the role of non-pharmacological strategies like physical activity in managing these conditions. This systematic review critically evaluates the effectiveness of Nursing based physical activity interventions in improving cognitive function, physical functioning, mobility, and overall quality of life among older adults with neurodegenerative diseases. We conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and other relevant databases, focusing on randomized controlled trials and observational studies that examined the impact of structured physical activity. Our findings from nineteen studies involving 1673 participants indicate that interventions ranging from aerobic exercises, resistance training, to mind-body exercises like Tai Chi and yoga have beneficial effects. Specifically, physical activity was consistently found to enhance cognitive performance, increase mobility, and improve balance and daily living activities, contributing to a better quality of life. However, these benefits vary depending on the type, intensity, and duration of the activity performed. Despite promising results, limitations such as small sample sizes, study heterogeneity, and short-term follow-up periods call for more robust, long-term studies to solidify these findings. This review underscores the potential of tailored physical activity programs as adjunctive therapy in the comprehensive management of neurodegenerative diseases among the elderly population.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; dementia; exercise; neurodegenerative diseases; older adults; physical activity,,"Alanazi, MA"

SARS-CoV-2-Induced Type I Interferon Signaling Dysregulation in Olfactory Networks Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Type I interferon signaling (IFN-I) perturbations are major drivers of COVID-19. Dysregulated IFN-I in the brain, however, has been linked to both reduced cognitive resilience and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Previous works from our group have proposed a model where peripheral induction of IFN-I may be relayed to the CNS, even in the absence of fulminant infection. The aim of our study was to identify significantly enriched IFN-I signatures and genes along the transolfactory route, utilizing published datasets of the nasal mucosa and olfactory bulb amygdala transcriptomes of COVID-19 patients. We furthermore sought to identify these IFN-I signature gene networks associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology and risk. Gene expression data involving the nasal epithelium, olfactory bulb, and amygdala of COVID-19 patients and transcriptomic data from Alzheimer's disease patients were scrutinized for enriched Type I interferon pathways. Gene set enrichment analyses and gene-Venn approaches were used to determine genes in IFN-I enriched signatures. The Agora web resource was used to identify genes in IFN-I signatures associated with Alzheimer's disease risk based on its aggregated multi-omic data. For all analyses, false discovery rates (FDR) <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Pathways associated with type I interferon signaling were found in all samples tested. Each type I interferon signature was enriched by IFITM and OAS family genes. A 14-gene signature was associated with COVID-19 CNS and the response to Alzheimer's disease pathology, whereas nine genes were associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease based on Agora. Our study provides further support to a type I interferon signaling dysregulation along the extended olfactory network as reconstructed herein, ranging from the nasal epithelium and extending to the amygdala. We furthermore identify the 14 genes implicated in this dysregulated pathway with Alzheimer's disease pathology, among which HLA-C, HLA-B, HLA-A, PSMB8, IFITM3, HLA-E, IFITM1, OAS2, and MX1 as genes with associated conferring increased risk for the latter. Further research into its druggability by IFNb therapeutics may be warranted.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; COVID-19; IFITM3; cGAS-STING; cognitive impairment; long COVID; nasal epithelial cells; type I interferon signaling,,"Vavougios, GD; Mavridis, T; Doskas, T; Papaggeli, O; Foka, P; Hadjigeorgiou, G"

Adapting a Dutch Web-Based Intervention to Support Family Caregivers of People With Dementia in the UK Context: Accelerated Experience-Based Co-Design.,"Around 700,000 family caregivers provide unpaid care for 900,000 people living with dementia in the United Kingdom. Few family caregivers receive support for their own psychological needs and funding for community respite services has declined. These trends are seen across Europe as demographic and budgetary pressures have intensified due to public spending cuts arising from the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization has prioritized the need to expand the provision of support for caregivers and families of people with dementia by 2025. Web-based interventions have the potential for development as they require modest investment and can be accessed by family caregivers at home. Further cost benefits can be realized by adapting existing interventions with demonstrated effectiveness for new contexts.

A review of SaiLuoTong (MLC-SLT) development in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia.,"The dementia epidemic, attributed to aging populations, represents a growing socio-economic burden. It is estimated that in 2019 about 55 million people worldwide were living with dementia. With many possible causes of dementia and the possibility of mixed dementia combining Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia the question is whether diagnostic uncertainty exists or whether diagnostic constructs based on single etiologies are incorrect. Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) designates the extent of cognitive dysfunctions from the most benign state to that of dementia, of vascular origin. We reviewed epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical data on VCID with a focus on VaD, as well as key data on the development of a new therapeutic solution, SaiLuoTong (MLC-SLT). From documentary research executed on different web sources (PubMed, Clintrials.gov, Z-library and Google), our initial selection for the short review of VCID and VaD was based on keywords contained in each paragraph subtitles of this article with exclusion of publications in a language other than English or published before 2010. For the review of SaiLuoTong development, there was just the language exclusion criterion. Sorted by relevance and publication date, 47 references were selected from 140 shortlisted for review. With new evidence-based classification systems, vascular cognitive impairment was proposed as umbrella term covering all forms of cognitive deficits related to vascular causes. The scope of application expanded with the VCID which includes VaD and mixed pathologies. No drugs are approved for the treatment of VaD by major Western regulatory agencies, while some traditional Chinese medicines are registered in China. VCID treatment should have a dual focus: managing the underlying cerebrovascular disease and dementia symptoms. This is the objective set for the development of the MLC-SLT, the essential data of which are reviewed in detail. To strengthen VCID and VaD research, consensus groups should attempt to consolidate scattered local research initiatives into coordinated international programs. In two VaD clinical trials, MLC-SLT improved cognitive symptoms and activities of daily living, with good safety and potential disease-modifying effect. In a placebo-controlled study in 325 patients with mild to moderate VaD and randomized according to a delayed-start design, MLC-SLT demonstrated significant improvement in memory tests and performance in executive function tasks, expanding its place in the management of VCID. At week 26, changes in VADAS-cog scores (SD) from baseline were 23.25 (0.45) for MLC-SLT 180 mg bid), 23.05 (0.45) for MLC-SLT 120 mg bid (both ",2024,MLC-SLT; VCID; VaD; cognivaid; sailuotong; vascular cognitive impairment; vascular cognitive impairment and dementia; vascular dementia,,"Ampil, ER; Ong, PA; Krespi, Y; Yang, YH"

CORDAX web server: an online platform for the prediction and 3D visualization of aggregation motifs in protein sequences.,"Proteins, the molecular workhorses of biological systems, execute a multitude of critical functions dictated by their precise three-dimensional structures. In a complex and dynamic cellular environment, proteins can undergo misfolding, leading to the formation of aggregates that take up various forms, including amorphous and ordered aggregation in the shape of amyloid fibrils. This phenomenon is closely linked to a spectrum of widespread debilitating pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-II diabetes, and several other proteinopathies, but also hampers the engineering of soluble agents, as in the case of antibody development. As such, the accurate prediction of aggregation propensity within protein sequences has become pivotal due to profound implications in understanding disease mechanisms, as well as in improving biotechnological and therapeutic applications.",2024,,"Software; Protein Aggregates; Internet; Amyloid; Proteins; Amino Acid Motifs; Humans; Protein Conformation; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Amino Acid Sequence","Louros, N; Rousseau, F; Schymkowitz, J"

"[ViaCogScreen: An Efficient, Valid, and Repeatable Screening Tool for Cognitive Performance Assessment of the Elderly].","Given the demographic change with an aging society in Germany, cognitive performance assessment of the elderly is of great importance. The Viacogscreen developed by us is a computer- and web-based brain performance screening for older adults that not only meets the criteria of a measurement instrument, but is also economical and repeatable. The test captures interlocking word list learning with delayed free recall and recognition, semantic word selection and fluidity, phonemic word fluidity and inverted number range, as well as incidental memory, resulting in a total of 17 performance parameters that provide a quick orientation (approximate test duration: 10-12 minutes) regarding the cognitive performance of a test subject. Three performance areas are depicted: executive functions, episodic and semantic memory. The test was standardized for 200 healthy test subjects in 6 different age groups (range: 50-85 years). For the first clinical validation, the test was used in the memory clinics in Bonn and Ulm, where 33 patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and 42 patients with suspected Alzheimer's disease (VAD) were tested. A control group of 42 healthy people of approximately the same age served as the control group. With regard to the cognitive test procedure, all three groups showed significantly different results regarding the overall score (ANOVA F=73.9, p<0.001), executive functions (F=27.6 p<0.001) and semantic memory (F=54.4 p<0.001). Regarding episodic memory, both clinical groups differed significantly from the control group, but not from each other (F=48.7, p<0.001). The Viacogscreen thus produced very good results in its first validation in two memory clinics with regard to differentiation of VAD, and good results with regard to MCI. In addition to use in neurodegenerative diseases, the Viacogscreen is also suitable for other neurological and neuro-oncological diseases, as well as for use in large clinical studies since it enables electronic data collection.",2024,,,"Schneider, M; Potthoff, AL; Pannicke, L; von Arnim, CAF; Jessen, F; Helmstaedter, C"

Changes in BDNF methylation patterns after cognitive remediation therapy in schizophrenia: A randomized and controlled trial.,"Although cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) produces cognitive benefits in schizophrenia, we do not yet understand whether molecular changes are associated with this cognitive improvement. A gene central to synaptic plasticity, the BDNF, has been proposed as one potential route. This study assesses whether BDNF methylation changes following CRT-produced cognitive improvement are detected. A randomized and controlled trial was performed with two groups (CRT, n = 40; TAU: Treatment as Usual, n = 20) on a sample of participants with schizophrenia. CRT was delivered by trained therapists using a web-based computerized program. Mixed Models, where the interaction of treatment (CRT, TAU) by time (T0: 0 weeks, T1: 16 weeks) was the main effect were used. Then, we tested the association between the treatment and methylation changes in three CpG islands of the BDNF gene. CRT group showed significant improvements in some cognitive domains. Between-groups differential changes in 5 CpG units over time were found, 4 in island 1 (CpG1.2, CpG1.7, CpG1.10, CpG1.17) and 1 in island 3 (CpG3.2). CRT group showed increases in methylation in CpG1.2, CpG1.7 and decreases in pG1.10, CpG1.17, and CpG3.2. Differences in the degree of methylation were associated with changes in Speed of Processing, Working Memory, and Verbal Learning within the CRT group. Those findings provide new data on the relationship between cognitive improvement and changes in peripheral methylation levels of BDNF gene, a key factor involved in neuroplasticity regulation.

Potential neuroprotective benefits of plant-based fermented foods in Alzheimer's disease: an update on preclinical evidence.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently lacks effective treatments, making its prevention a critical focus. While accumulating evidence supports that plant-based fermented foods may contribute to AD prevention, the neuroprotective effect of plant-based fermented foods on AD has not been comprehensively reviewed. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of preclinical studies on the efficacy of plant-based fermented foods in AD. The literature search was based on databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. The PICO approach was employed for report inclusion, and each report was assessed for risk of bias using the SYRCLE's RoB tool. From the analysis of 25 retrieved reports, we extracted essential details, including bibliographic information, animal models and characteristics, sources of plant-based fermented foods, dosages, administration routes, durations, and outcome measures. Our findings indicate that plant-based fermented foods may positively impact acute and long-term cognitive function, as well as beta-amyloid-mediated neurodegeneration. This review sheds light on the potential neuroprotective benefits of plant-based fermented foods for various AD-related aspects, including oxidative stress, synaptotoxicity, neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, dysfunctional amyloidogenic pathways, and cognitive deficits, as observed in rodent models of AD. However, the small number of studies obtained from our literature search and the finding that many of them were of moderate methodological quality suggest the need for further investigation to substantiate the beneficial potential of this class of functional food for the management of AD.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Humans; Fermented Foods; Neuroprotective Agents; Disease Models, Animal; Oxidative Stress; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Chen, JH; Yin, X; He, H; Lu, LW; Wang, M; Liu, B; Cheng, KW"

"Phytochemicals targeting Alzheimer's disease via the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, effects, and mechanisms of action.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by cognitive dysfunction and other behavioral abnormalities, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs due to aging. Currently, effective drugs to mitigate or treat AD remain unavailable. AD is associated with several abnormalities in neuronal energy metabolism, such as decreased glucose uptake, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defects in cholesterol metabolism. Amp-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates the energy status of cells. AMPK is widely present in eukaryotic cells and can sense and regulate energy metabolism to maintain energy supply and demand balance, making it a promising target for energy metabolism-based AD therapy. Therefore, this review aimed to discuss the molecular mechanism of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD to provide a theoretical basis for the development of new anti-AD drugs. To review the mechanisms of phytochemicals in the treatment of AD via AMPK pathway regulation, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase databases using specific keywords related to AD and phytochemicals in September 2023. Phytochemicals can activate AMPK or regulate the AMPK pathway to exert therapeutic effects in AD. The anti-AD mechanisms of these phytochemicals include inhibiting Aβ aggregation, preventing Tau hyperphosphorylation, inhibiting inflammatory response and glial activation, promoting autophagy, and suppressing anti-oxidative stress. Additionally, several AMPK-related pathways are involved in the anti-AD mechanism, including the AMPK/CaMKKβ/mTOR, AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α, AMPK/NF-κB/NLRP3, AMPK/mTOR, and PERK/eIF2α pathways. Notably, urolithin A, artemisinin, justicidin A, berberine, stigmasterol, arctigenin, and rutaecarpine are promising AMPK agonists with anti-AD effects. Several phytochemicals are effective AMPK agonists and may have potential applications in AD treatment. Overall, phytochemical-based drugs may overcome the barriers to the effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,AMPK; Alzheimer's disease; Phytochemicals; aging; medicinal plants,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Neurodegenerative Diseases; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Phytochemicals,"Zhao, Z; Yan, J; Huang, L; Yang, X"
Safety and efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of people worldwide. The most commonly used drugs are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, i.e., donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, which increase levels of acetylcholine. However, the exact efficacy and safety of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of AD is still unclear. The main objective of the current study was to determine the exact safety and efficacy profile of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of AD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We conducted a web-based literature search of PubMed and clinical trial websites using relevant keywords. Data were extracted from eligible records and pooled as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) values with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using Review Manager software (v. 5.3 for Windows). Heterogeneity was calculated using χ2 and I2 tests. The standard mean difference (SMD) was -0.33 [-0.52, -0.13] for donepezil, -0.48 [-0.58, -0.38] for galantamine and -0.65 [-1.06, -0.23] for rivastigmine, indicating a significant effect of these drugs on cognitive outcomes.

Machine learning driven web-based app platform for the discovery of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.,"Monoamine oxidases (MAOs), specifically MAO-A and MAO-B, play important roles in the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters. Therefore, MAO inhibitors are crucial for treating various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this study, we developed a novel cheminformatics pipeline by generating three diverse molecular feature-based machine learning-assisted quantitative structural activity relationship (ML-QSAR) models concerning MAO-B inhibition. PubChem fingerprints, substructure fingerprints, and one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) molecular descriptors were implemented to unravel the structural insights responsible for decoding the origin of MAO-B inhibition in 249 non-reductant molecules. Based on a random forest ML algorithm, the final PubChem fingerprint, substructure fingerprint, and 1D and 2D molecular descriptor prediction models demonstrated significant robustness, with correlation coefficients of 0.9863, 0.9796, and 0.9852, respectively. The significant features of each predictive model responsible for MAO-B inhibition were extracted using a comprehensive variance importance plot (VIP) and correlation matrix analysis. The final predictive models were further developed as a web application, MAO-B-pred ( https://mao-b-pred.streamlit.app/ ), to allow users to predict the bioactivity of molecules against MAO-B. Molecular docking and dynamics studies were conducted to gain insight into the atomic-level molecular interactions between the ligand-receptor complexes. These findings were compared with the structural features obtained from the ML-QSAR models, which supported the mechanistic understanding of the binding phenomena. The presented models have the potential to serve as tools for identifying crucial molecular characteristics for the rational design of MAO-B target inhibitors, which may be used to develop effective drugs for neurodegenerative disorders.",2024,1D and 2D molecular descriptors; Bioactivity; ML-QSAR; Molecular docking; Molecular dynamics simulation; Molecular interactions; Monoamine oxidase B; Prediction models; PubChem fingerprints; Substructure fingerprints; Web application,Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Mobile Applications; Monoamine Oxidase; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Dopamine Agents; Internet; Structure-Activity Relationship,"Kumar, S; Bhowmik, R; Oh, JM; Abdelgawad, MA; Ghoneim, MM; Al-Serwi, RH; Kim, H; Mathew, B"

Current Small Molecule-Based Medicinal Chemistry Approaches for Neurodegeneration Therapeutics.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) possess multifactorial aetiologies. In recent years, our understanding of the biochemical and molecular pathways across NDDs has increased, however, new advances in small molecule-based therapeutic strategies targeting NDDs are obscure and scarce. Moreover, NDDs have been studied for more than five decades, however, there is a paucity of drugs that can treat NDDs. Further, the highly lipoidal blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the uptake of many therapeutic molecules into the brain and is a complicating factor in the development of new agents to treat neurodegeneration. Considering the highly complex nature of NDDs, the association of multiple risk factors, and the challenges to overcome the BBB junction, medicinal chemists have developed small organic molecule-based novel approaches to target NDDs over the last few decades, such as designing lipophilic molecules and applying prodrug strategies. Attempts have been made to utilize a multitarget approach to modulate different biochemical molecular pathways involved in NDDs, in addition to, medicinal chemists making better decisions in identifying optimized drug candidates for the central nervous system (CNS) by using web-based computational tools. To increase the clinical success of these drug candidates, an in vitro assay modeling the BBB has been utilized by medicinal chemists in the pre-clinical phase as a further screening measure of small organic molecules. Herein, we examine some of the intriguing strategies taken by medicinal chemists to design small organic molecules to combat NDDs, with the intention of increasing our awareness of neurodegenerative therapeutics.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Computational tools; In Vitro Screening Assays; Neurodegenerative diseases; Parkinson's disease; Prodrug,"Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Small Molecule Libraries; Neuroprotective Agents; Blood-Brain Barrier; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Molecular Structure","Sanghai, N; Vuong, B; Burak Berk, A; Afridi, MSK; Tranmer, GK"

A Systematic Review of Intervention Trials Utilizing Biomarkers Among Informal Caregivers of People with Alzheimer's Disease & Related Dementias.,"Informal caregivers of people with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) experience unique stressors, reduced quality of life, and report poorer health, compared to non-caregivers. Throughout the last thirty years, researchers have developed and tested various psychosocial interventions and their ability to improve caregiver health. Due to an exclusive focus on self-report methods, however, no existing systematic literature reviews specifically examine intervention studies employing biomarkers; this systematic review aims to address this gap in the literature. In each database (PubMed and Web of Science, respectively), a title search was conducted with the following keywords: ""alzheimer*"" OR ""dementia"" AND ""caregiv*"" AND ""intervention"", followed by a second search using identical keywords except ""intervention"" was replaced with ""program."" Study or intervention protocol articles, exclusively qualitative studies, cultural applicability papers, dissemination studies, descriptive articles or program reports, acceptability/feasibility studies, studies utilizing formal caregiving samples, commentaries, review papers, and meta-analyses, erratums/corrections, measure development articles, factor analyses, and case reports were excluded from the final pool of studies. In this systematic review, the findings of 14 studies are summarized, and are organized based on specific types of biomarkers: neuroendocrine, immune, and autonomic physiological. Overall, the review yielded mixed results, which may, in part, be due to differences in the types of interventions tested, as well as differing biomarker measurement, methodology, and analysis. More biobehavioral intervention trials are needed among ADRD caregivers.

PACT - Prediction of amyloid cross-interaction by threading.,"Amyloid proteins are often associated with the onset of diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and many others. However, there is a wide class of functional amyloids that are involved in physiological functions, e.g., formation of microbial biofilms or storage of hormones. Recent studies showed that an amyloid fibril could affect the aggregation of another protein, even from a different species. This may result in amplification or attenuation of the aggregation process. Insight into amyloid cross-interactions may be crucial for better understanding of amyloid diseases and the potential influence of microbial amyloids on human proteins. However, due to the demanding nature of the needed experiments, knowledge of such interactions is still limited. Here, we present PACT (Prediction of Amyloid Cross-interaction by Threading) - the computational method for the prediction of amyloid cross-interactions. The method is based on modeling of a heterogeneous fibril formed by two amyloidogenic peptides. The resulting structure is assessed by the structural statistical potential that approximates its plausibility and energetic stability. PACT was developed and first evaluated mostly on data collected in the AmyloGraph database of interacting amyloids and achieved high values of Area Under ROC (AUC=0.88) and F1 (0.82). Then, we applied our method to study the interactions of CsgA - a bacterial biofilm protein that was not used in our in-reference datasets, which is expressed in several bacterial species that inhabit the human intestines - with two human proteins. The study included alpha-synuclein, a human protein that is involved in Parkinson's disease, and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), which is involved in type 2 diabetes. In both cases, PACT predicted the appearance of cross-interactions. Importantly, the method indicated specific regions of the proteins, which were shown to play a central role in both interactions. We experimentally confirmed the novel results of the indicated CsgA fragments interacting with hIAPP based on the kinetic characteristics obtained with the ThT assay. PACT opens the possibility of high-throughput studies of amyloid interactions. Importantly, it can work with fairly long protein fragments, and as a purely physicochemical approach, it relies very little on scarce training data.

Factors Affecting Physical Activity in People with Dementia: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis.,"Physical activity (PA) has positive effects on the physical and cognitive functioning of people with dementia. Knowledge about what limits and stimulates people with dementia to participate in PA is essential to promote effective PA implementation and enhance PA levels. Previous reviews primarily included opinion-based studies, using data from interviews, focus groups or dyads. By including implementation studies, we aimed to elaborate on previous reviews by identifying new barriers to PA and new facilitators and motivators for PA. We conducted systematic searches in Pubmed, PsychInfo and Web of Science for studies published up to the 21st of September 2021. Search terms were related to the population of people with dementia, PA interventions and implementation outcomes. Studies were included if PA participation was investigated during actual PA implementation. No restrictions were made regarding study design, date of publication, PA type or outcome measures. Studies not implementing PA or not evaluating the implementation were excluded. Based on 13 empirical studies, we identified 35 barriers, 19 facilitators and 12 motivators. Of these, 21 barriers, 11 facilitators and 4 motivators were not identified by previous reviews. New factors are related to the support for people with dementia from informal and formal caregivers, e.g., revealing the importance of a trusting relationship. Furthermore, support for staff from the institution or an external party is needed to overcome doubts about PA, for example, related to safety and effects. New factors also suggested specific recommendations for the content and organization of the PA intervention, for instance, related to how to give instructions. Overall, factors affecting PA identified with opinion-based or implementation studies are complementary. Our extended overview shows the complexity of PA implementation and may help to personalize PA, develop implementation strategies, facilitate actual PA implementation and free up resources needed for effective implementation.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; barrier; cognitive impairment; exercise; facilitator; motivator,,"Feenstra, RW; de Bruin, LJE; van Heuvelen, MJG"

A multi-layered network model identifies Akt1 as a common modulator of neurodegeneration.,"The accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins is a hallmark of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. Although multiple genetic loci have been associated with specific neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), molecular mechanisms that may have a broader relevance for most or all proteinopathies remain poorly resolved. In this study, we developed a multi-layered network expansion (MLnet) model to predict protein modifiers that are common to a group of diseases and, therefore, may have broader pathophysiological relevance for that group. When applied to the four NDs Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia types 1 and 3, we predicted multiple members of the insulin pathway, including PDK1, Akt1, InR, and sgg (GSK-3β), as common modifiers. We validated these modifiers with the help of four Drosophila ND models. Further evaluation of Akt1 in human cell-based ND models revealed that activation of Akt1 signaling by the small molecule SC79 increased cell viability in all models. Moreover, treatment of AD model mice with SC79 enhanced their long-term memory and ameliorated dysregulated anxiety levels, which are commonly affected in AD patients. These findings validate MLnet as a valuable tool to uncover molecular pathways and proteins involved in the pathophysiology of entire disease groups and identify potential therapeutic targets that have relevance across disease boundaries.

Promoting Advance Care Planning for Persons with Dementia: Study Protocol for the LEAD (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer's and Other Dementias) Clinical Trial.,"Due to the insidious progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), surrogate decision-makers typically make medical and long-term-care decisions for a care recipient, most often a family care partner. Unfortunately, many care recipient/care partner dyads have failed to engage in advance care planning or have lost the opportunity to do so due to the cognitive decline of the care recipient. To address this need, our team created a validated dementia-focused advance care planning tool known as the LEAD Guide (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer's and Other Dementias). With funding from the National Alzheimer's Association and in consultation with our community advisory board, we developed a preliminary web-based intervention. This intervention integrates the LEAD Guide with self-paced educational modules that lead dyads through conversations and dementia-focused advance care planning processes. In this concept paper, we describe the aims of our funded R01 clinical trial (National Institute on Aging), where we aim to refine our preliminary web-based platform for use in a 5-month mixed-method NIH Stage-1 behavioral intervention. Using a sample of diverse community-based ADRD dyads (n = 60), we aim to: 1) describe the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of the intervention, 2) assess the initial efficacy of the intervention on the primary outcome (decision-making self-efficacy), and secondary outcomes (relationship quality, subjective well-being, anxiety) as perceived by both the care recipient and the care partner, and 3) examine advance care planning congruence as a mechanism of action. The LEAD clinical trial addresses public health challenges by guiding and supporting families through challenging advance care planning conversations, facilitating the transfer of knowledge regarding care preferences and values from the care recipient to the care partner, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for both individuals with ADRD and their care partners.",2023,Decision-making; care partner; goals of care; persons with dementia,,"Dassel, KB; Iacob, E; Utz, RL; Supiano, KP; Fuhrmann, H"

Prediction of misfolded proteins spreading in Alzheimer's disease using machine learning and spreading models.,"The pervasive impact of Alzheimer's disease on aging society represents one of the main challenges at this time. Current investigations highlight 2 specific misfolded proteins in its development: Amyloid-$\beta$ and tau. Previous studies focused on spreading for misfolded proteins exploited simulations, which required several parameters to be empirically estimated. Here, we provide an alternative view based on 2 machine learning approaches which we compare with known simulation models. The first approach applies an autoregressive model constrained by structural connectivity, while the second is based on graph convolutional networks. The aim is to predict concentrations of Amyloid-$\beta$ 2 yr after a provided baseline. We also evaluate its real-world effectiveness and suitability by providing a web service for physicians and researchers. In experiments, the autoregressive model generally outperformed state-of-the-art models resulting in lower prediction errors.

The Association Between Herpes Simplex Virus and Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant public health concern, affecting more than 6 million Americans; and currently, there are no cure or effective treatment options. The underlying etiology and pathogenesis are not fully understood, presenting a barrier to therapy. A substantial amount of data exists associating infection with Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and AD. This review of published studies highlights the epidemiological associations between HSV-1 and AD. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted on January 6, 2022, using PRISMA guidelines. Articles that presented epidemiological data correlating HSV-1 with AD were included. Bibliographies were screened for additional relevant articles as well. After review, 21 studies were included: 2 review articles and 19 population-based studies including case control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies.&nbsp; The quantitative data derived from the studies in this report substantiate a relationship between infection with HSV-1 and AD. Based on these results, it may be of reasonable benefit to more consistently treat latent or active HSV-1 infection with anti-viral medications to potentially reduce the risk of AD. Furthermore, a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial could elucidate the benefit of anti-viral therapy to prevent or limit AD.J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(10):1046-1052&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.6785.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Herpes Simplex; Herpesvirus 1, Human; Antiviral Agents; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Cohen, M; Austin, E; Bradu, S; Jagdeo, J"

Tutorial: a guide for the selection of fast and accurate computational tools for the prediction of intrinsic disorder in proteins.,"Intrinsic disorder is instrumental for a wide range of protein functions, and its analysis, using computational predictions from primary structures, complements secondary and tertiary structure-based approaches. In this Tutorial, we provide an overview and comparison of 23 publicly available computational tools with complementary parameters useful for intrinsic disorder prediction, partly relying on results from the Critical Assessment of protein Intrinsic Disorder prediction experiment. We consider factors such as accuracy, runtime, availability and the need for functional insights. The selected tools are available as web servers and downloadable programs, offer state-of-the-art predictions and can be used in a high-throughput manner. We provide examples and instructions for the selected tools to illustrate practical aspects related to the submission, collection and interpretation of predictions, as well as the timing and their limitations. We highlight two predictors for intrinsically disordered proteins, flDPnn as accurate and fast and IUPred as very fast and moderately accurate, while suggesting ANCHOR2 and MoRFchibi as two of the best-performing predictors for intrinsically disordered region binding. We link these tools to additional resources, including databases of predictions and web servers that integrate multiple predictive methods. Altogether, this Tutorial provides a hands-on guide to comparatively evaluating multiple predictors, submitting and collecting their own predictions, and reading and interpreting results.

Pharmacological effects of Safranal: An updated review.,"Safranal (a monoterpene aldehyde) is the major volatile component of saffron which is responsible for the saffron unique odor. Several studies have shown the pharmacological activities of safranal including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, nephroprotective, gastrointestinal protective, etc. This study was designed to review the pharmacological and medical effects of safranal and up-to-date previous knowledge. Moreover, some patents related to the pharmacological effects of safranal were gathered. Therefore, electronic databases including Web of Sciences, Scopus, and Pubmed for pharmacological effects and US patent, Patentscope, and Google Patent for patents were comprehensively searched by related English keywords from 2010 to June 2022. According to our review, most of the studies are related to the safranal effects on CNS such as antianxiety, analgesic, anticonvulsant, antiischemic, anti-tremor, memory enhancement and its protective effects on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. Other effects of safranal are antiasthmatic, antihypertensive, antiaging, anticataract, etc. Moreover, the protective effects of this agent on metabolic syndrome and diabetic nephropathy have been shown. Different mechanisms including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxation, antiapoptotic, and regulatory effects on the genes and proteins expression related to signaling pathways of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, proliferation, etc. are involved in safranal pharmacological effects. Some patents for the prevention and/or treatment of different diseases such as liver cancer, sleep disorder, depression, cognitive disorder, obesity and PMS were also included.

Immunological characterization and diagnostic models of RNA N6-methyladenosine regulators in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and it displays both clinical and molecular variability. RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulators are involved in a wide range of essential cellular processes. In this study, we aimed to identify molecular signatures associated with m6A in Alzheimer's disease and use those signatures to develop a predictive model. We examined the expression patterns of m6A regulators and immune features in Alzheimer's disease using the GSE33000 dataset. We examined the immune cell infiltration and molecular groups based on m6A-related genes in 310 Alzheimer's disease samples. The WGCNA algorithm was utilized to determine differently expressed genes within each cluster. After evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the random forest model, the support vector machine model, the generalized linear model, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting, the best machine model was selected. Methods such as nomograms, calibration curves, judgment curve analysis, and the use of independent data sets were used to verify the accuracy of the predictions made. Alzheimer's disease and non-disease Alzheimer's groups were compared to identify dysregulated m6A-related genes and activated immune responses. In Alzheimer's disease, two molecular clusters linked to m6A were identified. Immune infiltration analysis indicated substantial variation in protection between groups. Cluster 1 included processes like the Toll-like receptor signaling cascade, positive regulation of chromatin binding, and numerous malignancies; cluster 2 included processes like the cell cycle, mRNA transport, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. With a lower residual and root mean square error and a larger area under the curve (AUC = 0.951), the Random forest machine model showed the greatest discriminative performance. The resulting random forest model was based on five genes, and it performed well (AUC = 0.894) on external validation datasets. Accuracy in predicting Alzheimer's disease subgroups was also shown by analyses of nomograms, calibration curves, and decision curves. In this research, we methodically outlined the tangled web of connections between m6A and AD and created a promising prediction model for gauging the correlation between m6A subtype risk and AD pathology.",2023,,Humans; RNA; Alzheimer Disease; RNA Transport; Adenosine,"Hui, Y; Ma, Q; Zhou, XR; Wang, H; Dong, JH; Gao, LN; Zhang, T; Li, YY; Gong, T"
Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Cloud-Based Deep Learning Paradigm.,"Deep learning is playing a major role in identifying complicated structure, and it outperforms in term of training and classification tasks in comparison to traditional algorithms. In this work, a local cloud-based solution is developed for classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as MRI scans as input modality. The multi-classification is used for AD variety and is classified into four stages. In order to leverage the capabilities of the pre-trained GoogLeNet model, transfer learning is employed. The GoogLeNet model, which is pre-trained for image classification tasks, is fine-tuned for the specific purpose of multi-class AD classification. Through this process, a better accuracy of 98% is achieved. As a result, a local cloud web application for Alzheimer's prediction is developed using the proposed architectures of GoogLeNet. This application enables doctors to remotely check for the presence of AD in patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; GoogLeNet; convolution neural network; deep learning,,"Pruthviraja, D; Nagaraju, SC; Mudligiriyappa, N; Raisinghani, MS; Khan, SB; Alkhaldi, NA; Malibari, AA"
An Approach to Binary Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using LSTM.,"In this study, we use LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) networks to evaluate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data to overcome the shortcomings of conventional Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection techniques. Our method offers greater reliability and accuracy in predicting the possibility of AD, in contrast to cognitive testing and brain structure analyses. We used an MRI dataset that we downloaded from the Kaggle source to train our LSTM network. Utilizing the temporal memory characteristics of LSTMs, the network was created to efficiently capture and evaluate the sequential patterns inherent in MRI scans. Our model scored a remarkable AUC of 0.97 and an accuracy of 98.62%. During the training process, we used Stratified Shuffle-Split Cross Validation to make sure that our findings were reliable and generalizable. Our study adds significantly to the body of knowledge by demonstrating the potential of LSTM networks in the specific field of AD prediction and extending the variety of methods investigated for image classification in AD research. We have also designed a user-friendly Web-based application to help with the accessibility of our developed model, bridging the gap between research and actual deployment.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; long-short-term-memory; magnetic resonance imaging,,"Salehi, W; Baglat, P; Gupta, G; Khan, SB; Almusharraf, A; Alqahtani, A; Kumar, A"
Effects of Exercise on Quality of Life in Subjects with Alzheimer's Disease: Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that progressively affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It can interfere with daily activities and lead to a decline in cognitive abilities over time. Exercise-based interventions can complement Alzheimer's disease treatment. Exercise is a valuable tool in all healthcare settings and has shown promise as an effective cognitive improvement intervention for people with cognitive impairments. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to analyze the effect of physical exercise on the QoL of subjects with Alzheimer's disease. A search was performed with the help of the electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science. Randomized controlled trials with exercise-based interventions were selected. Four studies met the inclusion criteria, which included interventions based on exercise. The effects were summarized using standardized mean differences (95% confidence intervals) using random-effect models. The results showed that exercise had no significant effect on the QoL of subjects with Alzheimer. Thus, the effect of exercise interventions on the QoL of patients with Alzheimer's disease is not conclusive. More research is needed about this topic and the way in which the QoL is assessed; the necessity to conduct an objective way to assess the QoL in this population is mandatory.",2023,dementia; interventions; physical activity; quality of life,,"Mendes, M; Correia, É; Vitorino, A; Rodrigues, J; Cid, L; Bento, T; Antunes, R; Monteiro, D; Couto, N"

The performance of plasma phosphorylated tau231 in detecting Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau231 (P-tau231) is associated with neuropathological outcomes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The invasive access of cerebrospinal fluid has greatly stimulated interest in the identification of blood-based P-tau231, and the recent advent of single-molecule array assay for the quantification of plasma P-tau231 may provide a turning point to evaluate the usefulness of P-tau231 as an AD-related biomarker. Yet, in the plasma P-tau231 literature, findings with regard to its diagnostic utility have been inconsistent, and thus, we aimed to statistically investigate the potential of plasma P-tau231 in the context of AD via meta-analysis. Publications on plasma P-tau231 were systematically retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and Web of Science databases. A total of 10 studies covering 2007 participants were included, and we conducted random-effect or fixed-effect meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis using the STATA SE 14.0 software. According to our quantitative integration, plasma P-tau231 increased from cognitively unimpaired (CU) populations to mild cognitive impairment to AD and showed significant changes in pairwise comparisons of AD, mild cognitive impairment and CU. Plasma P-tau231 level was significantly higher in CU controls with positive amyloid-β (Aβ) status compared with Aβ-negative CU group. Additionally, the excellent diagnostic accuracy of plasma P-tau231 for asymptomatic Aβ pathology was verified by the pooled value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (standard mean difference [95% confidence interval]: .75 [.69, .81], P < 0.00001).

"Kaempferol, a potential neuroprotective agent in neurodegenerative diseases: From chemistry to medicine.","Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) encompass a range of conditions that involve progressive deterioration and dysfunction of the nervous system. Some of the common NDDs include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although significant progress has been made in understanding the pathological mechanisms of NDDs in recent years, the development of targeted and effective drugs for their treatment remains challenging. Kaempferol is a flavonoid whose derivatives include kaempferol-O-rhamnoside, 3-O-β-rutinoside/6-hydroxykaempferol 3,6-di-O-β-d-glucoside, and kaempferide. Emerging studies have suggested that kaempferol and its derivatives possess neuroprotective properties and may have potential therapeutic benefits in NDDs. Here, we aimed to provide a theoretical basis for the use of kaempferol and its derivatives in the clinical treatment of NDDs. We systematically reviewed the literature in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases until June 2022 using the search terms ""kaempferol,"" ""kaempferol derivatives,"" ""NDDs,"" ""pharmacokinetics,"" and ""biosynthesis"" according to the reporting items for systematic review (PRISMA) standard. Based on combined results of in vivo and in vitro studies, we summarize the basic mechanisms and targets of kaempferol and its derivatives in the management of AD, PD, HD, and ALS. Kaempferol and its derivatives exert a neuroprotective role mainly by preventing the deposition of amyloid fibrils (such as Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein), inhibiting microglia activation, reducing the release of inflammatory factors, restoring the mitochondrial membrane to prevent oxidative stress, protecting the blood-brain barrier, and inhibiting specific enzyme activities (such as cholinesterase). Kaempferol and its derivatives are promising natural neuroprotective agents. By determining their pharmacological mechanism, kaempferol and its derivatives may be new candidate drugs for the treatment of NDDs.",2023,Biosynthesis; Kaempferol; Neurodegenerative disease; Neuroinflammation; Oxidative stress; Pharmacokinetics,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neuroprotective Agents; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Kaempferols; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Huntington Disease,"Jin, S; Zhang, L; Wang, L"

Efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies in current Alzheimer's disease phase III clinical trials: A systematic review and interactive web app-based meta-analysis.,"The risk-benefit profile of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear, especially concerning their safety and overall effects on AD progression and cognitive function. Here, we investigated cognitive, biomarker and side effects of anti-Aβ mAbs in large phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in sporadic AD. The search was performed on Google Scholar, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov by applying Jadad score to evaluate the methodological quality of the reports. Studies were excluded if they scored < 3 on Jadad scale or if they analyzed less than 200 sporadic AD patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model in R. Primary outcomes were cognitive: AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary and tertiary outcomes included biomarkers of Aβ and tau pathology, adverse events, and performance on Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Scale. The meta-analysis included 14,980 patients in 14 studies and four mAbs: Bapineuzumab, Aducanumab, Solanezumab and Lecanemab. The results of this study suggest that anti-Aβ mAbs statistically improved cognitive and biomarker outcomes, particularly Aducanumab and Lecanemab. However, while cognitive effects were of small effect sizes, these drugs considerably increased risk of side effects such as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), especially in APOE-ε4 carriers. Meta-regression revealed that higher (better) baseline MMSE score was associated with improved ADAS Cog and CDR-SB.

Sequence-based machine learning method for predicting the effects of phosphorylation on protein-protein interactions.,"Protein phosphorylation, catalyzed by kinases, is an important biochemical process, which plays an essential role in multiple cell signaling pathways. Meanwhile, protein-protein interactions (PPI) constitute the signaling pathways. Abnormal phosphorylation status on protein can regulate protein functions through PPI to evoke severe diseases, such as Cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Due to the limited experimental evidence and high costs to experimentally identify novel evidence of phosphorylation regulation on PPI, it is necessary to develop a high-accuracy and user-friendly artificial intelligence method to predict phosphorylation effect on PPI. Here, we proposed a novel sequence-based machine learning method named PhosPPI, which achieved better identification performance (Accuracy and AUC) than other competing predictive methods of Betts, HawkDock and FoldX. PhosPPI is now freely available in web server (https://phosppi.sjtu.edu.cn/). This tool can help the user to identify functional phosphorylation sites affecting PPI and explore phosphorylation-associated disease mechanism and drug development.",2023,Machine learning; Phosphorylation; Protein-protein interaction; Sequence-based model,Phosphorylation; Artificial Intelligence; Proteins; Signal Transduction; Machine Learning; Computational Biology,"Hong, X; Lv, J; Li, Z; Xiong, Y; Zhang, J; Chen, HF"
Normative data for COGITAB: An Italian tablet-based test battery conceived for the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease.,"The number of people with dementia is increasing worldwide. Two main approaches have been adopted to identify subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD): the neuropsychological evaluation and the identification of biomarkers of AD. The first method is less invasive and easier to perform. This study assesses the psychometric properties of COGITAB, a novel web application d esigned to be sensitive to the subtle cognitive changes distinctive of the early Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and the preclinical phase of AD. We enrolled 518 healthy controls, classified according to several risk factors and the presence of a family history of dementia. The participants were given COGITAB after a neuropsychological screening. The COGITAB Total Score (TS) was significantly affected by age and years of education. Acquired risk factors and family history of dementia significantly impacted only the COGITAB total execution time (TET), not the TS.

Dietary flavanols restore hippocampal-dependent memory in older adults with lower diet quality and lower habitual flavanol consumption.,"Dietary flavanols are food constituents found in certain fruits and vegetables that have been linked to cognitive aging. Previous studies suggested that consumption of dietary flavanols might specifically be associated with the hippocampal-dependent memory component of cognitive aging and that memory benefits of a flavanol intervention might depend on habitual diet quality. Here, we tested these hypotheses in the context of a large-scale study of 3,562 older adults, who were randomly assigned to a 3-y intervention of cocoa extract (500 mg of cocoa flavanols per day) or a placebo [(COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study) COSMOS-Web, NCT04582617]. Using the alternative Healthy Eating Index in all participants and a urine-based biomarker of flavanol intake in a subset of participants [n = 1,361], we show that habitual flavanol consumption and diet quality at baseline are positively and selectively correlated with hippocampal-dependent memory. While the prespecified primary end point testing for an intervention-related improvement in memory in all participants after 1 y was not statistically significant, the flavanol intervention restored memory among participants in lower tertiles of habitual diet quality or habitual flavanol consumption. Increases in the flavanol biomarker over the course of the trial were associated with improving memory. Collectively, our results allow dietary flavanols to be considered in the context of a depletion-repletion paradigm and suggest that low flavanol consumption can act as a driver of the hippocampal-dependent component of cognitive aging.",2023,cognitive aging; dietary flavanols; hippocampus,Humans; Aged; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Polyphenols; Biomarkers; Cacao; Double-Blind Method,"Brickman, AM; Yeung, LK; Alschuler, DM; Ottaviani, JI; Kuhnle, GGC; Sloan, RP; Luttmann-Gibson, H; Copeland, T; Schroeter, H; Sesso, HD; Manson, JE; Wall, M; Small, SA"

Scientometric analysis of post-stroke depression research based on CiteSpace.,"Post-stroke depression (PSD) has served as a severe and common complication leading to a higher level of mortality. Though various studies have been focused on PSD, limited research endeavor has been dedicated to bibliometric analysis in the past. In view of this, the current analysis serves to elucidate the latest status of global research and pinpoint the emerging area of interest for PSD, in order to support further investigation of the field. Publications related to PSD were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database on September 24, 2022, and included in the bibliometric analysis. VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were used to visually analyze publication outputs, scientific cooperation, highly-cited references, and keywords to identify the current status and future trends in PSD research. A total of 533 publications were retrieved. The annual number of publications showed an increasing trend from 1999 to 2022. In terms of country and academic institution, the USA and Duke University have topped the list of PSD research respectively. Meanwhile, Robinson RG and Alexopoulos GS have been the most representative investigators of the field. In the past, researchers focused on the risk factors of PSD, late-life depression, and Alzheimer disease. In recent years, further research effort has been placed on meta-analysis, ischemic stroke, predictor, inflammation, mechanism, and mortality. In conclusion, in the past 20 years, PSD research has been progressing and gaining more attention.

Investigation of Anti-Alzheimer's Mechanisms of Sarsasapogenin Derivatives by Network-Based Combining Structure-Based Methods.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease with no cure, affects millions of people worldwide and has become one of the biggest healthcare challenges. Some investigated compounds play anti-AD roles at the cellular or the animal level, but their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we designed a strategy combining network-based and structure-based methods together to identify targets for anti-AD sarsasapogenin derivatives (AAs). First, we collected drug-target interactions (DTIs) data from public databases, constructed a global DTI network, and generated drug-substructure associations. After network construction, network-based models were built for DTI prediction. The best bSDTNBI-FCFP_4 model was further used to predict DTIs for AAs. Second, a structure-based molecular docking method was employed for rescreening the prediction results to obtain more credible target proteins.

Public perspective on medications to delay Alzheimer's disease symptoms.,"Disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease are emerging. Our research examined how personal risk for AD may influence intentions to ask for medications to delay symptoms of AD, and how the availability of such medications impacts interest in AD-related genetic testing. Invitations to a web-based survey were posted on social media sites. Respondents were sequentially assigned to imagine that they had a 5%, 15%, or 35% chance of developing AD. They were then provided a hypothetical scenario describing a medication that delayed AD symptoms. After reporting intentions to ask for the medication, respondents were asked about their interest in genetic testing to predict AD risk. Data from 310 individuals were analyzed. Intentions to ask for a preventative medication were greater for respondents presented AD risks of 35% compared to risks of 15% and 5% (86% vs. 66% vs. 62%, respectively, p < 0.001). The proportion who would ask for genetic susceptibility testing increased from 58% to 79% when respondents were told to imagine that a medication that delayed AD symptoms existed (p < 0.001). Findings suggest that individuals who know they have an increased risk for AD are more likely pursue medications to delay onset of disease symptoms, and the availability of AD-delaying treatments will increase interest in associated genetic testing. Findings provide insight about who will pursue emerging preventative medications, including individuals for whom the medications may be inappropriate, and the impact on genetic test utilization.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; attitudes; genetic susceptibility; genetic testing; risk assessment; survey,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genetic Testing; Surveys and Questionnaires,"Rich, MB; Blout Zawatsky, CL; Botta, JJ; Christensen, KD"

Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and risk variant carriers.,"Genetic studies of Alzheimer disease (AD) have prioritized variants in genes related to the amyloid cascade, lipid metabolism, and neuroimmune modulation. However, the cell-specific effect of variants in these genes is not fully understood. Here, we perform single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on nearly 300,000 nuclei from the parietal cortex of AD autosomal dominant (APP and PSEN1) and risk-modifying variant (APOE, TREM2 and MS4A) carriers. Within individual cell types, we capture genes commonly dysregulated across variant groups. However, specific transcriptional states are more prevalent within variant carriers. TREM2 oligodendrocytes show a dysregulated autophagy-lysosomal pathway, MS4A microglia have dysregulated complement cascade genes, and APOEε4 inhibitory neurons display signs of ferroptosis. All cell types have enriched states in autosomal dominant carriers. We leverage differential expression and single-nucleus ATAC-seq to map GWAS signals to effector cell types including the NCK2 signal to neurons in addition to the initially proposed microglia.

"Cardiac Troponin, Cognitive Function, and Dementia: A Systematic Review.","Elevated cardiac troponin, a biomarker of myocardial injury, has been found in individuals with brain damage and lower cognitive function. We conducted a systematic review to examine the association of troponin with cognitive function, incidence of dementia and dementia-related outcomes. PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched from inception to August 2022. Inclusion criteria were: (i) population-based cohort studies; (ii) troponin measured as determinant; and (iii) cognitive function in any metric or diagnosis of any type of dementia or dementia-related measures as outcomes. Fourteen studies were identified and included, with a combined total of 38,286 participants. Of these studies, four examined dementia-related outcomes, eight studies examined cognitive function, and two studies examined both dementia-related outcomes and cognitive function. Studies report higher troponin to be associated with higher prevalence of cognitive impairment (n=1), incident dementia (n=1), increased risk of dementia hospitalization (specifically due to vascular dementia) (n=1), but not with incident Alzheimer's Disease (n=2). Majority of studies on cognitive function found elevated troponin also associated with worse global cognitive function (n=3), attention (n=2), reaction time (n=1) and visuomotor speed (n=1), both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Evidence regarding the association between higher troponin and memory, executive function, processing speed, language and visuospatial function was mixed.

Suitability of Goal Attainment Scaling in Older Adult Populations with Neurodegenerative Disease Experiencing Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Identifying responsive outcome measures for assessing functional change related to cognition, communication, and quality of life for individuals with neurodegenerative disease is important for intervention design and clinical care. Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) has been used as an outcome measure to formally develop and systematically measure incremental progress toward functional, patient-centered goals in clinical settings. Evidence suggests that GAS is reliable and feasible for use in older adult populations and in adult populations with cognitive impairment, but no review has assessed the suitability of GAS in older adults with neurodegenerative disease experiencing dementia or cognitive impairment, based on responsiveness. This study conducted a systematic review to evaluate the suitability of GAS as an outcome measure for older adult populations with neurodegenerative disease experiencing dementia or cognitive impairment, based on responsiveness.",2023,Dementia; Goal Attainment Scaling; Meta-analysis; Neurodegenerative disease; Systematic review,Humans; Aged; Dementia; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Quality of Life; Goals; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Fegter, O; Santos, H; Rademaker, AW; Roberts, AC; Rogalski, E"

MicroRNAs and MAPKs: Evidence of These Molecular Interactions in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder known to be the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) were found deregulated in the brain or blood of AD patients, suggesting a possible key role in different stages of neurodegeneration. In particular, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling can be impaired by miRNA dysregulation during AD. Indeed, the aberrant MAPK pathway may facilitate the development of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and Tau pathology, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and brain cell death. The aim of this review was to describe the molecular interactions between miRNAs and MAPKs during AD pathogenesis by selecting evidence from experimental AD models. Publications ranging from 2010 to 2023 were considered, based on PubMed and Web of Science databases. According to obtained data, several miRNA deregulations may regulate MAPK signaling in different stages of AD and conversely. Moreover, overexpressing or silencing miRNAs involved in MAPK regulation was seen to improve cognitive deficits in AD animal models. In particular, miR-132 is of particular interest due to its neuroprotective functions by inhibiting Aβ and Tau depositions, as well as oxidative stress, through ERK/MAPK1 signaling modulation. However, further investigations are required to confirm and implement these promising results.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; MAPK; microRNAs; neurodegeneration,Animals; Alzheimer Disease; MicroRNAs; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Signal Transduction; Brain; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,"Raffaele, I; Silvestro, S; Mazzon, E"
The association of dietary and nutrient patterns on neurocognitive decline: A systematic review of MRI and PET studies.,"As the global population ages, there has been a growing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. More recently, studies exploring the relationship between dietary patterns and neuroimaging outcomes have received particular attention. This systematic literature review provides a structured overview of the association between dietary and nutrient patterns on neuroimaging outcomes and cognitive markers in middle-aged to older adults. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to find relevant articles published from 1999 to date using the following databases Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria for the articles comprised studies reporting on the association between dietary patterns and neuroimaging outcomes, which includes both specific pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as Aβ and tau and nonspecific markers such as structural MRI and glucose metabolism. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Quality Assessment tool from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The results were then organized into a summary of results table, collated based on synthesis without meta-analysis. After conducting the search, 6050 records were extracted and screened for eligibility, with 107 eligible for full-text screening and 42 articles ultimately being included in this review. The results of the systematic review indicate that there is some evidence suggesting that healthy dietary and nutrient patterns were associated with neuroimaging measures, indicative of a protective influence on neurodegeneration and brain ageing. Conversely, unhealthy dietary and nutrient patterns showed evidence pointing to decreased brain volumes, poorer cognition and increased Aβ deposition. Future research should focus on sensitive neuroimaging acquisition and analysis methods, to study early neurodegenerative changes and identify critical periods for interventions and prevention.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Brain volume; Cognition; Hippocampus; Neuroimaging; Nutrition,United States; Humans; Aged; Middle Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Neuroimaging; Nutrients; Positron-Emission Tomography,"Arnoldy, L; Gauci, S; Young, LM; Marx, W; Macpherson, H; Pipingas, A; Civier, O; White, DJ"

A Systematic Review on the Potential Acceleration of Neurocognitive Aging in Older Cancer Survivors.,"As survival rates increase, more emphasis has gone to possible cognitive sequelae in older cancer patients, which could be explained by accelerated brain aging. In this review, we provide a complete overview of studies investigating neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and neurodegenerative disorders in older cancer survivors (>65 years), based on three databases (Pubmed, Web of Science and Medline). Ninety-six studies were included. Evidence was found for functional and structural brain changes (frontal regions, basal ganglia, gray and white matter), compared to healthy controls. Cognitive decline was mainly found in memory functioning. Anti-hormonal treatments were repeatedly associated with cognitive decline (tamoxifen) and sometimes with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (androgen deprivation therapy). Chemotherapy was inconsistently associated with later development of cognitive changes or dementia. Radiotherapy was not associated with cognition in patients with non-central nervous system cancer but can play a role in patients with central nervous system cancer, while neurosurgery seemed to improve their cognition in the short-term. Individual risk factors included cancer subtypes (e.g., brain cancer, hormone-related cancers), treatment (e.g., anti-hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, cranial radiation), genetic predisposition (e.g., APOE, COMT, BDNF), age, comorbidities (e.g., frailty, cognitive reserve), and psychological (e.g., depression, (post-traumatic) distress, sleep, fatigue) and social factors (e.g., loneliness, limited caregiver support, low SES).

Effects of traditional Chinese exercise on vascular function in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with an insidious onset, usually characterized by memory impairment, visual-spatial skill impairment, executive dysfunction and personality behavioral changes. Studies have confirmed that vascular dysfunction may precede AD pathological changes and can present as vascular malformations, atherosclerosis, and impaired self-regulation, and can affect oxidative stress and amyloidosis. Therefore, it is important to improve or prevent vascular dysfunction in AD patients. Regular exercise can effectively inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species during the occurrence of AD and can improve the reduction of cerebral blood flow due to AD. Previous studies have shown that exercise can achieve superior clinical results in improving vascular function in AD patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that traditional Chinese exercises (TCEs) may have a good clinical effect in improving vascular function in patients with AD.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Exercise; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Network Meta-Analysis; Pulse Wave Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,"Li, J; Wang, C; Zhang, P"

Trace elements and Alzheimer dementia in population-based studies: A bibliometric and meta-analysis.,"Alterations in the concentrations of trace elements may play a vital role in Alzheimer dementia progression. However, previous research results are inconsistent, and there is still a lack of review on the relationship between all the studied-trace elements and AD from various perspectives of population-based studies. In this study, we systematically reviewed previous population-based studies and identified the altered trace elements in AD patients. We searched the Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and Scopus database, and ultimately included 73 articles. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to explore the evolution of the field from an epidemiological perspective. Bibliometric data such as trace elements, biological materials, detection methods, cognitive tests, co-occurrence and co-citation statistics are all analyzed and presented in a quantitative manner. The 73 included studies analyzed 39 trace elements in total. In a further meta-analysis, standardized mean differences (SMDs) of 13 elements were calculated to evaluate their altered in AD patients, including copper, iron, zinc, selenium, manganese, lead, aluminum, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, mercury, cobalt, and manganese. We identified four trace elements-copper (serum), iron (plasma), zinc (hair), and selenium (plasma)-altered in AD patients, with SMDs of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10, 0.65), -0.68 (95% CI: -1.34, -0.02), -0.35 (95% CI: -0.62, -0.08), and -0.61 (95% CI: -0.97, -0.25), respectively.

GeneSelectML: a comprehensive way of gene selection for RNA-Seq data via machine learning algorithms.,"Selection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is a vital process to discover the causes of diseases. It has been shown that modelling of genomics data by considering relation among genes increases the predictive performance of methods compared to univariate analysis. However, there exist serious differences among most studies analyzing the same dataset for the reasons arising from the methods. Therefore, there is a strong need for easily accessible, user-friendly, and interactive tool to perform gene selection for RNA-seq data via machine learning algorithms simultaneously not to miss DEGs. We develop an open-source and freely available web-based tool for gene selection via machine learning algorithms that can deal with high performance computation. This tool includes six machine learning algorithms having different aspects. Moreover, the tool involves classical pre-processing steps; filtering, normalization, transformation, and univariate analysis. It also offers well-arranged graphical approaches; network plot, heatmap, venn diagram, and box-and-whisker plot. Gene ontology analysis is provided for both mRNA and miRNA DEGs. The implementation is carried out on Alzheimer RNA-seq data to demonstrate the use of this web-based tool. Eleven genes are suggested by at least two out of six methods. One of these genes, hsa-miR-148a-3p, might be considered as a new biomarker for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Kidney Chromophobe dataset is also analyzed to demonstrate the validity of GeneSelectML web tool on a different dataset. GeneSelectML is distinguished in that it simultaneously uses different machine learning algorithms for gene selection and can perform pre-processing, graphical representation, and gene ontology analyses on the same tool. This tool is freely available at www.softmed.hacettepe.edu.tr/GeneSelectML .",2023,Feature selection; Genomics; Machine learning; RNA-seq data; Web tool,RNA-Seq; Algorithms; Machine Learning,"Dag, O; Kasikci, M; Ilk, O; Yesiltepe, M"

MT1-MMP and ADAM10/17 exhibit a remarkable overlap of shedding properties.,"Membrane-type-I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is one of six human membrane-bound MMPs and is responsible for extracellular matrix remodelling by degrading several substrates like fibrillar collagens, including types I-III, or fibronectin. Moreover, MT1-MMP was described as a key player in cancer progression and it is involved in various inflammatory processes, as well as in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The membrane-tethered metalloprotease meprin β as well as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) and ADAM17 are also associated with these diseases. Interestingly, meprin β, ADAM10/17 and MT1-MMP also have a shared substrate pool including the interleukin-6 receptor and the amyloid precursor protein. We investigated the interaction of these proteases, focusing on a possible connection between MT1-MMP and meprin β, to elucidate the potential mutual regulations of both enzymes. Herein, we show that besides ADAM10/17, MT1-MMP is also able to shed meprin β from the plasma membrane, leading to the release of soluble meprin β. Mass spectrometry-based cleavage site analysis revealed that the cleavage of meprin β by all three proteases occurs between Pro",2023,ADAM10; ADAM17; MT1-MMP; meprin; proteolysis; shedding,Humans; ADAM10 Protein; ADAM17 Protein; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Cell Membrane; Matrix Metalloproteinase 14; Membrane Proteins,"Werny, L; Grogro, A; Bickenbach, K; Bülck, C; Armbrust, F; Koudelka, T; Pathak, K; Scharfenberg, F; Sammel, M; Sheikhouny, F; Tholey, A; Linder, S; Becker-Pauly, C"

The effect of long-term exposure to toxic air pollutants on the increased risk of malignant brain tumors.,"Toxic air pollutants are one of the most agent that have many acute, chronic and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on human health under long or short-term exposure has been raised from the past to the present. The aim of this study was investigation effect of long-term exposure to toxic air pollutants on the increased risk of malignant brain tumors. Databases used to for searched were the PubMed, Web of Science, Springer and Science Direct (Scopus) and Google Scholar. 71 papers based on abstract and article text filtered. In the end after sieve we selected 7 papers. Identify all relevant studies published 1970-2022. The literature showed that exposure to toxic air pollutants and their respiration can cause disorders in different parts of the brain by transmission through the circulatory system and other mechanisms. Various unpleasant abnormalities are caused by the inhalation of toxic air pollutants in the human body that some of the most common of them include chronic lung disease, coronary heart disease and heart attacks, strokes and brain diseases (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and multiple Sclerosis), cancers (liver, blood, prostate and brain) and eventually death. According to the finding brain health and proper functioning can be easily disrupted by various genetic or external factors such as air pollution, causing a wide range of abnormalities in the brain and malignant brain tumors. The results of this study showed that reducing the concentration of toxic pollutants in the air, that exposure to them play an increasing role in the development of brain diseases can slow down the process of abnormalities in the brain and will have significant impacts on reducing the number of people affected by them.",2023,brain tumors; long-term exposure; risk of malignant; toxic air pollutants,Male; Humans; Air Pollutants; Environmental Exposure; Air Pollution; Brain Neoplasms; Environmental Pollutants; Particulate Matter,"Nikmanesh, Y; Mohammadi, MJ; Yousefi, H; Mansourimoghadam, S; Taherian, M"
