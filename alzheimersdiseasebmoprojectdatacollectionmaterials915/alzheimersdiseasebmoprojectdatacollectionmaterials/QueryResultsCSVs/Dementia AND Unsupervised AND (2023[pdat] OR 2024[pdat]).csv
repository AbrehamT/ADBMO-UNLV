Identification and immunological characterization of genes associated with ferroptosis in Alzheimer's disease and experimental demonstration.," The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rising globally, yet its treatment and prediction of this condition remain challenging due to the complex pathophysiological mechanisms associated with it. Consequently, the objective of the present study was to analyze and characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis‑related genes (FEGs) in the pathogenesis of AD, as well as to construct a prognostic model. The findings will provide new insights for the future diagnosis and treatment of AD. First, the AD dataset GSE33000 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and the FEGs from FerrDB were obtained. Next, unsupervised cluster analysis was used to obtain the FEGs that were most relevant to AD. Subsequently, enrichment analyses were performed on the FEGs to explore biological functions. Subsequently, the role of these genes in the immune microenvironment was elucidated through CIBERSORT. Then, the optimal machine learning was selected by comparing the performance of different machine learning models. To validate the prediction efficiency, the models were validated using nomograms, calibration curves, decision curve analysis and external datasets. Furthermore, the expression of FEGs between different groups was verified using reverse transcription quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. In AD, alterations in the expression of FEGs affect the aggregation and infiltration of certain immune cells. This indicated that the occurrence of AD is strongly associated with immune infiltration. Finally, the most appropriate machine learning models were selected, and AD diagnostic models and nomograms were built. The present study provided novel insights that enhance understanding with regard to the molecular mechanism of action of FEGs in AD. Moreover, the present study provided biomarkers that may facilitate the diagnosis of AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; ferroptosis; immune infiltration; machine learning model; nomogram,"Alzheimer Disease; Ferroptosis; Humans; Machine Learning; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Biomarkers; Prognosis; Gene Expression Regulation; Computational Biology","Xiao, Z; Hu, R; Liu, WL; He, XX; Dong, MY; Huang, ZS"
Artificial intelligence classifies primary progressive aphasia from connected speech.,"Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best divided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this cross-sectional study, we first harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform unsupervised classification of short, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Large Language Models (LLMs) discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. In the subsequent supervised classification, seventeen distinctive features emerged, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of short, connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in classifying the four groups (three PPA variants and healthy controls). The data-driven section of this study showcases the ability of LLMs to find natural partitioning in the speech of patients with PPA consistent with conventional variants. In addition, the work identifies a robust set of language features indicative of each PPA variant, emphasizing the significance of dividing verbs into high and low-frequency categories. Beyond improving diagnostic accuracy, these findings enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of language processing.",2024,data-driven classification; generative artificial intelligence; primary progressive aphasia (PPA); theory-driven classification; verb frequency,,"Rezaii, N; Hochberg, D; Quimby, M; Wong, B; Brickhouse, M; Touroutoglou, A; Dickerson, BC; Wolff, P"
Social Media Discourse Related to Caregiving for Older Adults Living With Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias: Computational and Qualitative Study.,"In the United States, caregivers of people living with Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) provide >16 billion hours of unpaid care annually. These caregivers experience high levels of stress and burden related to the challenges associated with providing care.

AI-based mining of biomedical literature: Applications for drug repurposing for the treatment of dementia.,"Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and others significantly affect individuals, their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. While there are no cures yet, researchers worldwide are actively working on the development of novel treatments that have the potential to slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and ultimately improve the overall health of patients. Huge volumes of new scientific information necessitate new analytical approaches for meaningful hypothesis generation. To enable the automatic analysis of biomedical data we introduced AGATHA, an effective AI-based literature mining tool that can navigate massive scientific literature databases, such as PubMed. The overarching goal of this effort is to adapt AGATHA for drug repurposing by revealing hidden connections between FDA-approved medications and a health condition of interest. Our tool converts the abstracts of peer-reviewed papers from PubMed into multidimensional space where each gene and health condition are represented by specific metrics. We implemented advanced statistical analysis to reveal distinct clusters of scientific terms within the virtual space created using AGATHA-calculated parameters for selected health conditions and genes. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was employed for categorizing and predicting samples (122 diseases and 20889 genes) fitted to specific classes. Advanced statistics were employed to build a discrimination model and extract lists of genes specific to each disease class. Here we focus on drugs that can be repurposed for dementia treatment as an outcome of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we determined dementia-associated genes statistically highly ranked in other disease classes. Additionally, we report a mechanism for detecting genes common to multiple health conditions. These sets of genes were classified based on their presence in biological pathways, aiding in selecting candidates and biological processes that are exploitable with drug repurposing.",2024,,,"Sikirzhytskaya, A; Tyagin, I; Sutton, SS; Wyatt, MD; Safro, I; Shtutman, M"

Differential responses of primary neuron-secreted MCP-1 and IL-9 to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease-associated metabolites.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is implicated as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. In this work, we investigated neuroinflammatory responses of primary neurons to potentially circulating, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable metabolites associated with AD, T2D, or both. We identified nine metabolites associated with protective or detrimental properties of AD and T2D in literature (lauric acid, asparagine, fructose, arachidonic acid, aminoadipic acid, sorbitol, retinol, tryptophan, niacinamide) and stimulated primary mouse neuron cultures with each metabolite before quantifying cytokine secretion via Luminex. We employed unsupervised clustering, inferential statistics, and partial least squares discriminant analysis to identify relationships between cytokine concentration and disease-associations of metabolites. We identified MCP-1, a cytokine associated with monocyte recruitment, as differentially abundant between neurons stimulated by metabolites associated with protective and detrimental properties of AD and T2D. We also identified IL-9, a cytokine that promotes mast cell growth, to be differentially associated with T2D. Indeed, cytokines, such as MCP-1 and IL-9, released from neurons in response to BBB-permeable metabolites associated with T2D may contribute to AD development by downstream effects of neuroinflammation.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Mice; Neurons; Chemokine CCL2; Interleukin-9; Blood-Brain Barrier; Cells, Cultured","Ball, BK; Kuhn, MK; Fleeman Bechtel, RM; Proctor, EA; Brubaker, DK"
Estimation of Gait Parameters in Huntington's Disease Using Wearable Sensors in the Clinic and Free-living Conditions.,"In Huntington's disease (HD), wearable inertial sensors could capture subtle changes in motor function. However, disease-specific validation of methods is necessary. This study presents an algorithm for walking bout and gait event detection in HD using a leg-worn accelerometer, validated only in the clinic and deployed in free-living conditions. Seventeen HD participants wore shank- and thigh-worn tri-axial accelerometers, and a wrist-worn device during two-minute walk tests in the clinic, with video reference data for validation. Thirteen participants wore one of the thigh-worn tri-axial accelerometers (AP: ActivPAL4) and the wrist-worn device for 7 days under free-living conditions, with proprietary AP data used as reference. Gait events were detected from shank and thigh acceleration using the Teager-Kaiser energy operator combined with unsupervised clustering. Estimated step count (SC) and temporal gait parameters were compared with reference data. In the clinic, low mean absolute percentage errors were observed for stride (shank/thigh: 0.6/0.9%) and stance (shank/thigh: 3.3/7.1%) times, and SC (shank/thigh: 3.1%). Similar errors were observed for proprietary AP SC (3.2%), with higher errors observed for the wrist-worn device (10.9%). At home, excellent agreement was observed between the proposed algorithm and AP software for SC and time spent walking (ICC [Formula: see text]). The wrist-worn device overestimated SC by 34.2%. The presented algorithm additionally allowed stride and stance time estimation, whose variability correlated significantly with clinical motor scores. The results demonstrate a new method for accurate estimation of HD gait parameters in the clinic and free-living conditions, using a single accelerometer worn on either the thigh or shank.",2024,,"Humans; Huntington Disease; Male; Female; Algorithms; Middle Aged; Wearable Electronic Devices; Accelerometry; Adult; Reproducibility of Results; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Gait; Equipment Design; Aged; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Wrist; Walking; Biomechanical Phenomena; Sensitivity and Specificity","Lozano-Garcia, M; Doheny, EP; Mann, E; Morgan-Jones, P; Drew, C; Busse-Morris, M; Lowery, MM"
Unsupervised multimodal modeling of cognitive and brain health trajectories for early dementia prediction.,"Predicting the course of neurodegenerative disorders early has potential to greatly improve clinical management and patient outcomes. A key challenge for early prediction in real-world clinical settings is the lack of labeled data (i.e., clinical diagnosis). In contrast to supervised classification approaches that require labeled data, we propose an unsupervised multimodal trajectory modeling (MTM) approach based on a mixture of state space models that captures changes in longitudinal data (i.e., trajectories) and stratifies individuals without using clinical diagnosis for model training. MTM learns the relationship between states comprising expensive, invasive biomarkers (β-amyloid, grey matter density) and readily obtainable cognitive observations. MTM training on trajectories stratifies individuals into clinically meaningful clusters more reliably than MTM training on baseline data alone and is robust to missing data (i.e., cognitive data alone or single assessments). Extracting an individualized cognitive health index (i.e., MTM-derived cluster membership index) allows us to predict progression to AD more precisely than standard clinical assessments (i.e., cognitive tests or MRI scans alone). Importantly, MTM generalizes successfully from research cohort to real-world clinical data from memory clinic patients with missing data, enhancing the clinical utility of our approach. Thus, our multimodal trajectory modeling approach provides a cost-effective and non-invasive tool for early dementia prediction without labeled data (i.e., clinical diagnosis) with strong potential for translation to clinical practice.",2024,,"Humans; Male; Female; Dementia; Brain; Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognition; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Burkhart, MC; Lee, LY; Vaghari, D; Toh, AQ; Chong, E; Chen, C; Tiňo, P; Kourtzi, Z"
Unsupervised deep representation learning enables phenotype discovery for genetic association studies of brain imaging.,"Understanding the genetic architecture of brain structure is challenging, partly due to difficulties in designing robust, non-biased descriptors of brain morphology. Until recently, brain measures for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisted of traditionally expert-defined or software-derived image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that are often based on theoretical preconceptions or computed from limited amounts of data. Here, we present an approach to derive brain imaging phenotypes using unsupervised deep representation learning. We train a 3-D convolutional autoencoder model with reconstruction loss on 6130 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants' T1 or T2-FLAIR (T2) brain MRIs to create a 128-dimensional representation known as Unsupervised Deep learning derived Imaging Phenotypes (UDIPs). GWAS of these UDIPs in held-out UKBB subjects (n = 22,880 discovery and n = 12,359/11,265 replication cohorts for T1/T2) identified 9457 significant SNPs organized into 97 independent genetic loci of which 60 loci were replicated. Twenty-six loci were not reported in earlier T1 and T2 IDP-based UK Biobank GWAS. We developed a perturbation-based decoder interpretation approach to show that these loci are associated with UDIPs mapped to multiple relevant brain regions. Our results established unsupervised deep learning can derive robust, unbiased, heritable, and interpretable brain imaging phenotypes.",2024,,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Genetic Loci; Brain; Neuroimaging,"Patel, K; Xie, Z; Yuan, H; Islam, SMS; Xie, Y; He, W; Zhang, W; Gottlieb, A; Chen, H; Giancardo, L; Knaack, A; Fletcher, E; Fornage, M; Ji, S; Zhi, D"
Data-driven normative values based on generative manifold learning for quantitative MRI.,"In medicine, abnormalities in quantitative metrics such as the volume reduction of one brain region of an individual versus a control group are often provided as deviations from so-called normal values. These normative reference values are traditionally calculated based on the quantitative values from a control group, which can be adjusted for relevant clinical co-variables, such as age or sex. However, these average normative values do not take into account the globality of the available quantitative information. For example, quantitative analysis of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images based on anatomical structure segmentation frequently includes over 100 cerebral structures in the quantitative reports, and these tend to be analyzed separately. In this study, we propose a global approach to personalized normative values for each brain structure using an unsupervised Artificial Intelligence technique known as generative manifold learning. We test the potential benefit of these personalized normative values in comparison with the more traditional average normative values on a population of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy operated for focal cortical dysplasia, as well as on a supplementary healthy group and on patients with Alzheimer's disease.",2024,,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Learning; Alzheimer Disease,"Attyé, A; Renard, F; Anglade, V; Krainik, A; Kahane, P; Mansencal, B; Coupé, P; Calamante, F"
A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"

Proteomics of mouse brain endothelium uncovers dysregulation of vesicular transport pathways during aging.,"Age-related decline in brain endothelial cell (BEC) function contributes critically to neurological disease. Comprehensive atlases of the BEC transcriptome have become available, but results from proteomic profiling are lacking. To gain insights into endothelial pathways affected by aging, we developed a magnetic-activated cell sorting-based mouse BEC enrichment protocol compatible with proteomics and resolved the profiles of protein abundance changes during aging. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed a segregation of age-related protein dynamics with biological functions, including a downregulation of vesicle-mediated transport. We found a dysregulation of key regulators of endocytosis and receptor recycling (most prominently Arf6), macropinocytosis and lysosomal degradation. In gene deletion and overexpression experiments, Arf6 affected endocytosis pathways in endothelial cells. Our approach uncovered changes not picked up by transcriptomic studies, such as accumulation of vesicle cargo and receptor ligands, including Apoe. Proteomic analysis of BECs from Apoe-deficient mice revealed a signature of accelerated aging. Our findings provide a resource for analysing BEC function during aging.",2024,,Mice; Animals; Endothelial Cells; Proteomics; Brain; Endothelium; Apolipoproteins E,"Todorov-Völgyi, K; González-Gallego, J; Müller, SA; Beaufort, N; Malik, R; Schifferer, M; Todorov, MI; Crusius, D; Robinson, S; Schmidt, A; Körbelin, J; Bareyre, F; Ertürk, A; Haass, C; Simons, M; Paquet, D; Lichtenthaler, SF; Dichgans, M"

However, unsupervised decompositions do not inculcate clinical assessment information, while supervised approaches extract only individual feature importance, thereby impeding qualitative interpretation at the level of subspaces.",2024,Brain networks; Functional connectivity; Heterogeneity; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Multimodal fusion; Neuroimaging; Subspace analysis,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Neuroimaging; Machine Learning; Male; Aged; Female; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Algorithms","Batta, I; Abrol, A; Calhoun, VD"

Diagnosis-Guided Deep Subspace Clustering Association Study for Pathogenetic Markers Identification of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Comparative Atlases.,"The roles of brain region activities and genotypic functions in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. Meanwhile, current imaging genetics methods are difficult to identify potential pathogenetic markers by correlation analysis between brain network and genetic variation. To discover disease-related brain connectome from the specific brain structure and the fine-grained level, based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and human Brainnetome atlases, the functional brain network is first constructed for each subject. Specifically, the upper triangle elements of the functional connectivity matrix are extracted as connectivity features. The clustering coefficient and the average weighted node degree are developed to assess the significance of every brain area. Since the constructed brain network and genetic data are characterized by non-linearity, high-dimensionality, and few subjects, the deep subspace clustering algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the original data. Our multilayer neural network helps capture the non-linear manifolds, and subspace clustering learns pairwise affinities between samples. Moreover, most approaches in neuroimaging genetics are unsupervised learning, neglecting the diagnostic information related to diseases. We presented a label constraint with diagnostic status to instruct the imaging genetics correlation analysis. To this end, a diagnosis-guided deep subspace clustering association (DDSCA) method is developed to discover brain connectome and risk genetic factors by integrating genotypes with functional network phenotypes. Extensive experiments prove that DDSCA achieves superior performance to most association methods and effectively selects disease-relevant genetic markers and brain connectome at the coarse-grained and fine-grained levels.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cluster Analysis; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Connectome; Algorithms; Aged; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Atlases as Topic; Neuroimaging,"Jiao, CN; Shang, J; Li, F; Cui, X; Wang, YL; Gao, YL; Liu, JX"

Multisensory Calibration: A Variety of Slow and Fast Brain Processes Throughout the Lifespan.,"From before we are born, throughout development, adulthood, and aging, we are immersed in a multisensory world. At each of these stages, our sensory cues are constantly changing, due to body, brain, and environmental changes. While integration of information from our different sensory cues improves precision, this only improves accuracy if the underlying cues are unbiased. Thus, multisensory calibration is a vital and ongoing process. To meet this grand challenge, our brains have evolved a variety of mechanisms. First, in response to a systematic discrepancy between sensory cues (without external feedback) the cues calibrate one another (unsupervised calibration). Second, multisensory function is calibrated to external feedback (supervised calibration). These two mechanisms superimpose. While the former likely reflects a lower level mechanism, the latter likely reflects a higher level cognitive mechanism. Indeed, neural correlates of supervised multisensory calibration in monkeys were found in higher level multisensory cortical area VIP, but not in the relatively lower level multisensory area MSTd. In addition, even without a cue discrepancy (e.g., when experiencing stimuli from different sensory cues in series) the brain monitors supra-modal statistics of events in the environment and adapts perception cross-modally. This too comprises a variety of mechanisms, including confirmation bias to prior choices, and lower level cross-sensory adaptation. Further research into the neuronal underpinnings of the broad and diverse functions of multisensory calibration, with improved synthesis of theories is needed to attain a more comprehensive understanding of multisensory brain function.",2024,Accurate; Adaptation; Perception; Recalibration; Self-motion; Serial dependence; Supervised; Unsupervised; Vestibular; Visual,Humans; Longevity; Calibration; Brain; Frontotemporal Dementia,"Zaidel, A"
Dementia Prediction in Older Adults Using Sex-Specific Health Trajectory Clustering.,"With increasing number of people living with dementia, the problem of late diagnosis significantly impacts a person's quality of life while early signs of dementia may provide useful insights to facilitate better treatment plans. With time, this progressive neurodegenerative syndrome could progress from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. A pattern of health conditions can be characterized in unsupervised manner to help predict this progress. As a significant extension to our previous work with streaming clustering model, we consider additional information for predicting dementia onset. With empirical observations, we discover the importance of examining sex and age to predict dementia onset. To this end, we propose a sex-specific model with age-constraint for predicting dementia onset and validate the effectiveness of our models using data from Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). The proposed sex-specific models for older adult populations (>=65 years of age) outperformed the previous models with F-score of 77% and 78% for male-specific and female-specific models, respectively.

Using Generative Artificial Intelligence to Classify Primary Progressive Aphasia from Connected Speech.,"Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles.

Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.",2023,,,"Rezaii, N; Quimby, M; Wong, B; Hochberg, D; Brickhouse, M; Touroutoglou, A; Dickerson, BC; Wolff, P"
Computerized cognitive training for memory functions in mild cognitive impairment or dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Dementia is a common medical condition in the ageing population, and cognitive intervention is a non-pharmacologic strategy to improve cognitive functions.

The study was registered prospectively with PROSPERO under CRD42022363715 and received no funding. The search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO on Sept 19, 2022, and Google Scholar on May 9, 2023, to identify randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of CCT on memory outcomes in individuals with MCI or dementia. Mean differences and standard deviations of neuropsychological assessment scores were extracted to derive standardized mean differences. Our search identified 10,678 studies, of which 35 studies were included. Among 1489 participants with MCI, CCT showed improvements in verbal memory (SMD (95%CI) = 0.55 (0.35-0.74)), visual memory (0.36 (0.12-0.60)), and working memory (0.37 (0.10-0.64)).

Enabling Lipidomic Biomarker Studies for Protected Populations by Combining Noninvasive Fingerprint Sampling with MS Analysis and Machine Learning.,"Triacylglycerols and wax esters are two lipid classes that have been linked to diseases, including autism, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, cardiovascular disease, dry eye disease, and diabetes, and thus are molecules worthy of biomarker exploration studies. Since triacylglycerols and wax esters make up the majority of skin-surface lipid secretions, a viable sampling method for these potential biomarkers would be that of groomed latent fingerprints. Currently, however, blood-based sampling protocols predominate in the field. The invasiveness of a blood draw limits its utility to protected populations, including children and the elderly. Herein we describe a noninvasive means for sample collection (from fingerprints) paired with fast MS data-acquisition (MassIVE data set MSV000092742) and efficient data analysis via machine learning. Using both supervised and unsupervised classification, we demonstrate the usefulness of this method in determining whether a variable of interest imparts measurable change within the lipidomic data set. As a proof-of-concept, we show that the method is capable of distinguishing between the fingerprints of different individuals as well as between anatomical sebum collection regions. This noninvasive, high-throughput approach enables future lipidomic biomarker researchers to more easily include underrepresented, protected populations, such as children and the elderly, thus moving the field closer to definitive disease diagnoses that apply to all.",2024,biomarkers; fingerprints; lipidomics; lipids; machine learning; mass spectrometry; noninvasive sampling,,"Isom, M; Go, EP; Desaire, H"
Analyzing risk factors for post-acute recovery in older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia: A new semi-parametric model for large-scale medicare claims.,"Nearly 300,000 older adults experience a hip fracture every year, the majority of which occur following a fall. Unfortunately, recovery after fall-related trauma such as hip fracture is poor, where older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) spend a particularly long time in hospitals or rehabilitation facilities during the post-operative recuperation period. Because older adults value functional recovery and spending time at home versus facilities as key outcomes after hospitalization, identifying factors that influence days spent at home after hospitalization is imperative. While several individual-level factors have been identified, the characteristics of the treating hospital have recently been identified as contributors. However, few methodological rigorous approaches are available to help overcome potential sources of bias such as hospital-level unmeasured confounders, informative hospital size, and loss to follow-up due to death. This article develops a useful tool equipped with unsupervised learning to simultaneously handle statistical complexities that are often encountered in health services research, especially when using large administrative claims databases. The proposed estimator has a closed form, thus only requiring light computation load in a large-scale study. We further develop its asymptotic properties with stabilized inference assisted by unsupervised clustering. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate superiority of the proposed estimator compared to existing estimators.",2024,dementia; post-discharge outcome; profile least square; propensity score weighting; unsupervised learning,Humans; Aged; United States; Alzheimer Disease; Medicare; Hospitalization; Risk Factors; Physical Therapy Modalities; Retrospective Studies,"Shen, B; Ren, H; Shardell, M; Falvey, J; Chen, C"
Predicting Dementia Risk for Elderly Community Dwellers in Primary Care Services Using Subgroup-specific Prediction Models.,"Early detection of individuals with a high risk of dementia is crucial for prompt intervention and clinical care. This study aims to identify high-risk groups for developing dementia by predicting the outcome of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), using historical data collected from community-based primary care services. To mitigate the effect of inter-individual variability and enhance the accuracy of the prediction, we implemented a multi-stage method powered by supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Firstly, we preprocessed the original data by imputing missing values and using a wrapper-based feature selection algorithm to pick significant features, resulting in ten variables out of 567 being selected for further modeling. Secondly, we optimized hierarchical clustering to partition the unlabeled data into groups by their similarities, and then applied supervised machine learning models to build subgroup-specific prediction models for the identified groups. The results demonstrate that the proposed subgroup-specific prediction models generated from the multi-stage method achieved satisfactory performance in predicting the outcome classes of dementia risk. This study highlights the potential of incorporating unsupervised and supervised learning models to predict high-risk cases of dementia early and facilitate better clinical decision-making.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Supervised Machine Learning; Algorithms; Dementia; Primary Health Care,"Hang Kwok, SW; Sipka, C; Matthews, A; Lara, CP; Wang, G; Choi, KS"

Differential responses of primary neuron-secreted MCP-1 and IL-9 to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease-associated metabolites.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is implicated as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. In this work, we investigated neuroinflammatory responses of primary neurons to potentially circulating, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable metabolites associated with AD, T2D, or both. We identified nine metabolites associated with protective or detrimental properties of AD and T2D in literature (lauric acid, asparagine, fructose, arachidonic acid, aminoadipic acid, sorbitol, retinol, tryptophan, niacinamide) and stimulated primary mouse neuron cultures with each metabolite before quantifying cytokine secretion via Luminex. We employed unsupervised clustering, inferential statistics, and partial least squares discriminant analysis to identify relationships between cytokine concentration and disease-associations of metabolites. We identified MCP-1, a cytokine associated with monocyte recruitment, as differentially abundant between neurons stimulated by metabolites associated with protective and detrimental properties of AD and T2D. We also identified IL-9, a cytokine that promotes mast cell growth, to be differentially associated with T2D. Indeed, cytokines, such as MCP-1 and IL-9, released from neurons in response to BBB-permeable metabolites associated with T2D may contribute to AD development by downstream effects of neuroinflammation.",2023,,,"Ball, BK; Kuhn, MK; Fleeman, RM; Proctor, EA; Brubaker, DK"
Automatic segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in T2-FLAIR with AQUA: A comparative validation study against conventional methods.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are lesions in the white matter of the brain that are associated with cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia. The manual segmentation of WMHs is highly time-consuming and prone to intra- and inter-variability. Therefore, automatic segmentation approaches are gaining attention as a more efficient and objective means to detect and monitor WMHs. In this study, we propose AQUA, a deep learning model designed for fully automatic segmentation of WMHs from T2-FLAIR scans, which improves upon our previous study for small lesion detection and incorporating a multicenter approach. AQUA implements a two-dimensional U-Net architecture and uses patch-based training. Additionally, the network was modified to include Bottleneck Attention Module on each convolutional block of both the encoder and decoder to enhance performance for small-sized WMH. We evaluated the performance and robustness of AQUA by comparing it with five well-known supervised and unsupervised methods for automatic segmentation of WMHs (LGA, LPA, SLS, UBO, and BIANCA). To accomplish this, we tested these six methods on the MICCAI 2017 WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset, which contains MRI images from 170 elderly participants with WMHs of presumed vascular origin, and assessed their robustness across multiple sites and scanner types. The results showed that AQUA achieved superior performance in terms of spatial (Dice = 0.72) and volumetric (logAVD = 0.10) agreement with the manual segmentation compared to the other methods. While the recall and F1-score were moderate at 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, they improved to 0.75 and 0.82 when excluding small lesions (≤ 6 voxels). Remarkably, despite being trained on a different dataset with different ethnic backgrounds, lesion loads, and scanners, AQUA's results were comparable to the top 10 ranked methods of the MICCAI challenge. The findings suggest that AQUA is effective and practical for automatic segmentation of WMHs from T2-FLAIR scans, which could help identify individuals at risk of cognitive decline and dementia and allow for early intervention and management.",2023,Automatic segmentation; Comparative study; T2-FLAIR; U-Net; White matter hyperintensities,Humans; Aged; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Mental Recall; Dementia,"Lee, S; Rieu, Z; Kim, RE; Lee, M; Yen, K; Yong, J; Kim, D"
Joint learning framework of cross-modal synthesis and diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease by mining underlying shared modality information.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders presenting irreversible progression of cognitive impairment. How to identify AD as early as possible is critical for intervention with potential preventive measures. Among various neuroimaging modalities used to diagnose AD, functional positron emission tomography (PET) has higher sensitivity than structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but it is also costlier and often not available in many hospitals. How to leverage massive unpaired unlabeled PET to improve the diagnosis performance of AD from MRI becomes rather important. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel joint learning framework of unsupervised cross-modal synthesis and AD diagnosis by mining underlying shared modality information, improving the AD diagnosis from MRI while synthesizing more discriminative PET images. We mine underlying shared modality information in two aspects: diversifying modality information through the cross-modal synthesis network and locating critical diagnosis-related patterns through the AD diagnosis network. First, to diversify the modality information, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal synthesis network, which implements the inter-conversion between 3D PET and MRI in a single model modulated by the AdaIN module. Second, to locate shared critical diagnosis-related patterns, we propose an interpretable diagnosis network based on fully 2D convolutions, which takes either 3D synthesized PET or original MRI as input. Extensive experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that our framework can synthesize more realistic images, outperform the state-of-the-art AD diagnosis methods, and have better generalization on external AIBL and NACC datasets.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis; Cross-modal synthesis; Joint learning; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Positron emission tomography (PET),Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Learning; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Wang, C; Piao, S; Huang, Z; Gao, Q; Zhang, J; Li, Y; Shan, H"
SaLSa: A Combinatory Approach of Semi-Automatic Labeling and Long Short-Term Memory to Classify Behavioral Syllables.,"Accurately and quantitatively describing mouse behavior is an important area. Although advances in machine learning have made it possible to track their behaviors accurately, reliable classification of behavioral sequences or syllables remains a challenge. In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach, called SaLSa (a combination of semi-automatic labeling and long short-term memory-based classification), to classify behavioral syllables of mice exploring an open field. This approach consists of two major steps. First, after tracking multiple body parts, spatial and temporal features of their egocentric coordinates are extracted. A fully automated unsupervised process identifies candidates for behavioral syllables, followed by manual labeling of behavioral syllables using a graphical user interface (GUI). Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier is trained with the labeled data. We found that the classification performance was marked over 97%. It provides a performance equivalent to a state-of-the-art model while classifying some of the syllables. We applied this approach to examine how hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease develops with age. When the proportion of each behavioral syllable was compared between genotypes and sexes, we found that the characteristic hyperlocomotion of female Alzheimer's disease mice emerges between four and eight months. In contrast, age-related reduction in rearing is common regardless of genotype and sex. Overall, SaLSa enables detailed characterization of mouse behavior.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aging; classification; computational ethology; deep learning; long short-term memory,"Mice; Female; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Memory, Short-Term; Memory, Long-Term","Sakata, S"
A Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation Framework for 3D MRI Classification of Gliomas and Alzheimer's Diseases.,"Accurate and fully automated brain structure examination and prediction from 3D volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a necessary step in medical imaging analysis, which can assist greatly in clinical diagnosis. Traditional deep learning models suffer from severe performance degradation when applied to clinically acquired unlabeled data. The performance degradation is mainly caused by domain discrepancy such as different device types and parameter settings for data acquisition. However, existing approaches focus on the reduction of domain discrepancies but ignore the entanglement of semantic features and domain information. In this article, we explore the feature invariance of categories and domains in different projection spaces and propose a Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation (STDA) method using a joint optimal transport theory and contrastive learning for automatic 3D MRI classification and glioma multi-grade prediction. Specifically, the learning framework updates the distribution of features across domains and categories by Siamese transport network training with an Optimal Cost Transfer Strategy (OCTS) and a Mutual Invariant Constraint (MIC) in two projective spaces to find multiple invariants in potential heterogeneity. We design three sets of transfer task scenarios with different source and target domains, and demonstrate that STDA yields substantially higher generalization performance than other state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. The method is applicable on 3D MRI data from glioma to Alzheimer's disease and has promising applications in the future clinical diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Brain","Yu, L; Liu, J; Wu, Q; Wang, J; Qu, A"

Unsupervised contrastive graph learning for resting-state functional MRI analysis and brain disorder detection.,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) helps characterize regional interactions that occur in the human brain at a resting state. Existing research often attempts to explore fMRI biomarkers that best predict brain disease progression using machine/deep learning techniques. Previous fMRI studies have shown that learning-based methods usually require a large amount of labeled training data, limiting their utility in clinical practice where annotating data is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To this end, we propose an unsupervised contrastive graph learning (UCGL) framework for fMRI-based brain disease analysis, in which a pretext model is designed to generate informative fMRI representations using unlabeled training data, followed by model fine-tuning to perform downstream disease identification tasks. Specifically, in the pretext model, we first design a bi-level fMRI augmentation strategy to increase the sample size by augmenting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, and then employ two parallel graph convolutional networks for fMRI feature extraction in an unsupervised contrastive learning manner. This pretext model can be optimized on large-scale fMRI datasets, without requiring labeled training data. This model is further fine-tuned on to-be-analyzed fMRI data for downstream disease detection in a task-oriented learning manner. We evaluate the proposed method on three rs-fMRI datasets for cross-site and cross-dataset learning tasks. Experimental results suggest that the UCGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in automated diagnosis of three brain diseases (i.e., major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease) with rs-fMRI data.",2023,brain disorder; data augmentation; fine-tuning; functional MRI; small-sample-size,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Rest; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease","Wang, X; Chu, Y; Wang, Q; Cao, L; Qiao, L; Zhang, L; Liu, M"
Artificial intelligence for dementia research methods optimization.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly being used in dementia research. However, several methodological challenges exist that may limit the insights we can obtain from high-dimensional data and our ability to translate these findings into improved patient outcomes. To improve reproducibility and replicability, researchers should make their well-documented code and modeling pipelines openly available. Data should also be shared where appropriate. To enhance the acceptability of models and AI-enabled systems to users, researchers should prioritize interpretable methods that provide insights into how decisions are generated. Models should be developed using multiple, diverse datasets to improve robustness, generalizability, and reduce potentially harmful bias. To improve clarity and reproducibility, researchers should adhere to reporting guidelines that are co-produced with multiple stakeholders. If these methodological challenges are overcome, AI and ML hold enormous promise for changing the landscape of dementia research and care. HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning (ML) can improve diagnosis, prevention, and management of dementia. Inadequate reporting of ML procedures affects reproduction/replication of results.

Metabolic Pathway Pairwise-Based Signature as a Potential Non-Invasive Diagnostic Marker in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Early screening, particularly in blood plasma, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to the diagnosis and prevention of AD. In addition, metabolic dysfunction has been demonstrated to be closely related to AD, which might be reflected in the whole blood transcriptome. Hence, we hypothesized that the establishment of a diagnostic model based on the metabolic signatures of blood is a workable strategy. To that end, we initially constructed metabolic pathway pairwise (MPP) signatures to characterize the interplay among metabolic pathways. Then, a series of bioinformatic methodologies, e.g., differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, network analysis, etc., were used to investigate the molecular mechanism behind AD. Moreover, an unsupervised clustering analysis based on the MPP signature profile via the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm was utilized to stratify AD patients. Finally, aimed at distinguishing AD patients from non-AD groups, a metabolic pathway-pairwise scoring system (MPPSS) was established using multi-machine learning methods. As a result, many metabolic pathways correlated to AD were disclosed, including oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, etc. NMF clustering analysis divided AD patients into two subgroups (S1 and S2), which exhibit distinct activities of metabolism and immunity. Typically, oxidative phosphorylation in S2 exhibits a lower activity than that in S1 and non-AD group, suggesting the patients in S2 might possess a more compromised brain metabolism. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis showed that the patients in S2 might have phenomena of immune suppression compared with S1 and the non-AD group. These findings indicated that S2 probably has a more severe progression of AD. Finally, MPPSS could achieve an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.77) in the training dataset, 0.71 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.77) in the testing dataset, and an AUC of 0.99 (95%CI: 0.96, 1.00) in one external validation dataset. Overall, our study successfully established a novel metabolism-based scoring system for AD diagnosis using the blood transcriptome and provided new insight into the molecular mechanism of metabolic dysfunction implicated in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; metabolic abnormalities; multi-machine learning; noninvasive diagnosis; peripheral blood,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Algorithms; Machine Learning; Cluster Analysis; Metabolic Networks and Pathways,"Feng, Y; Chen, X; Zhang, XD; Huang, C"

Machine learning algorithms for identifying predictive variables of mortality risk following dementia diagnosis: a longitudinal cohort study.,"Machine learning (ML) could have advantages over traditional statistical models in identifying risk factors. Using ML algorithms, our objective was to identify the most important variables associated with mortality after dementia diagnosis in the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders (SveDem). From SveDem, a longitudinal cohort of 28,023 dementia-diagnosed patients was selected for this study. Sixty variables were considered as potential predictors of mortality risk, such as age at dementia diagnosis, dementia type, sex, body mass index (BMI), mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, time from referral to initiation of work-up, time from initiation of work-up to diagnosis, dementia medications, comorbidities, and some specific medications for chronic comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease). We applied sparsity-inducing penalties for three ML algorithms and identified twenty important variables for the binary classification task in mortality risk prediction and fifteen variables to predict time to death. Area-under-ROC curve (AUC) measure was used to evaluate the classification algorithms. Then, an unsupervised clustering algorithm was applied on the set of twenty-selected variables to find two main clusters which accurately matched surviving and dead patient clusters. A support-vector-machines with an appropriate sparsity penalty provided the classification of mortality risk with accuracy = 0.7077, AUROC = 0.7375, sensitivity = 0.6436, and specificity = 0.740. Across three ML algorithms, the majority of the identified twenty variables were compatible with literature and with our previous studies on SveDem. We also found new variables which were not previously reported in literature as associated with mortality in dementia. Performance of basic dementia diagnostic work-up, time from referral to initiation of work-up, and time from initiation of work-up to diagnosis were found to be elements of the diagnostic process identified by the ML algorithms. The median follow-up time was 1053 (IQR = 516-1771) days in surviving and 1125 (IQR = 605-1770) days in dead patients. For prediction of time to death, the CoxBoost model identified 15 variables and classified them in order of importance. These highly important variables were age at diagnosis, MMSE score, sex, BMI, and Charlson Comorbidity Index with selection scores of 23%, 15%, 14%, 12% and 10%, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of sparsity-inducing ML algorithms in improving our understanding of mortality risk factors in dementia patients and their application in clinical settings. Moreover, ML methods can be used as a complement to traditional statistical methods.",2023,,Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Cohort Studies; Machine Learning; Algorithms; Dementia,"Mostafaei, S; Hoang, MT; Jurado, PG; Xu, H; Zacarias-Pons, L; Eriksdotter, M; Chatterjee, S; Garcia-Ptacek, S"
Neurophenotypes of COVID-19: Risk factors and recovery outcomes.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is associated with risk of persistent neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric complications. It is unclear whether the neuropsychological manifestations of COVID-19 present as a uniform syndrome or as distinct neurophenotypes with differing risk factors and recovery outcomes. We examined post-acute neuropsychological profiles following SARS-CoV-2 infection in 205 patients recruited from inpatient and outpatient populations, using an unsupervised machine learning cluster analysis, with objective and subjective measures as input features. This resulted in three distinct post-COVID clusters. In the largest cluster (69%), cognitive functions were within normal limits, although mild subjective attention and memory complaints were reported. Vaccination was associated with membership in this ""normal cognition"" phenotype. Cognitive impairment was present in the remaining 31% of the sample but clustered into two differentially impaired groups. In 16% of participants, memory deficits, slowed processing speed, and fatigue were predominant. Risk factors for membership in the ""memory-speed impaired"" neurophenotype included anosmia and more severe COVID-19 infection. In the remaining 15% of participants, executive dysfunction was predominant. Risk factors for membership in this milder ""dysexecutive"" neurophenotype included disease-nonspecific factors such as neighborhood deprivation and obesity. Recovery outcomes at 6-month follow-up differed across neurophenotypes, with the normal cognition group showing improvement in verbal memory and psychomotor speed, the dysexecutive group showing improvement in cognitive flexibility, and the memory-speed impaired group showing no objective improvement and relatively worse functional outcomes compared to the other two clusters. These results indicate that there are multiple post-acute neurophenotypes of COVID-19, with different etiological pathways and recovery outcomes.

msQSM: Morphology-based self-supervised deep learning for quantitative susceptibility mapping.,"Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been applied to the measurement of iron deposition and the auxiliary diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease. There still exists a dipole inversion problem in QSM reconstruction. Recently, deep learning approaches have been proposed to resolve this problem. However, most of these approaches are supervised methods that need pairs of the input phase and ground-truth. It remains a challenge to train a model for all resolutions without using the ground-truth and only using one resolution data. To address this, we proposed a self-supervised QSM deep learning method based on morphology. It consists of a morphological QSM builder to decouple the dependency of the QSM on acquisition resolution, and a morphological loss to reduce artifacts effectively and save training time efficiently. The proposed method can reconstruct arbitrary resolution QSM on both human data and animal data, regardless of whether the resolution is higher or lower than that of the training set. Our method outperforms the previous best unsupervised method with a 3.6% higher peak signal-to-noise ratio, 16.2% lower normalized root mean square error, and 22.1% lower high-frequency error norm. The morphological loss reduces training time by 22.1% with respect to the cycle gradient loss used in the previous unsupervised methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method accurately measures QSM with arbitrary resolutions, and achieves state-of-the-art results among unsupervised deep learning methods. Research on applications in neurodegenerative diseases found that our method is robust enough to measure significant increase in striatal magnetic susceptibility in patients during Alzheimer's disease progression, as well as significant increase in substantia nigra susceptibility in Parkinson's disease patients, and can be used as an auxiliary differential diagnosis tool for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Arbitrary resolution; Parkinson’s disease; Self-supervised learning; Susceptibility quantitative mapping,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Deep Learning; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Brain; Algorithms","He, J; Peng, Y; Fu, B; Zhu, Y; Wang, L; Wang, R"

Genetic risk factor clustering within and across neurodegenerative diseases.,"Overlapping symptoms and co-pathologies are common in closely related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Investigating genetic risk variants across these NDDs can give further insight into disease manifestations. In this study we have leveraged genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and genome-wide association study summary statistics to cluster patients based on their genetic status across identified risk variants for five NDDs (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia). The multi-disease and disease-specific clustering results presented here provide evidence that NDDs have more overlapping genetic aetiology than previously expected and how neurodegeneration should be viewed as a spectrum of symptomology. These clustering analyses also show potential subsets of patients with these diseases that are significantly depleted for any known common genetic risk factors suggesting environmental or other factors at work. Establishing that NDDs with overlapping pathologies share genetic risk loci, future research into how these variants might have different effects on downstream protein expression, pathology and NDD manifestation in general is important for refining and treating NDDs.",2023,dementia; genome-wide association study; machine learning; single-nucleotide polymorphism; unsupervised,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Genome-Wide Association Study; Parkinson Disease; Lewy Body Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors,"Koretsky, MJ; Alvarado, C; Makarious, MB; Vitale, D; Levine, K; Bandres-Ciga, S; Dadu, A; Scholz, SW; Sargent, L; Faghri, F; Iwaki, H; Blauwendraat, C; Singleton, A; Nalls, M; Leonard, H"

"Explainable semi-supervised deep learning shows that dementia is associated with small, avocado-shaped clocks with irregularly placed hands.","The clock drawing test is a simple and inexpensive method to screen for cognitive frailties, including dementia. In this study, we used the relevance factor variational autoencoder (RF-VAE), a deep generative neural network, to represent digitized clock drawings from multiple institutions using an optimal number of disentangled latent factors. The model identified unique constructional features of clock drawings in a completely unsupervised manner. These factors were examined by domain experts to be novel and not extensively examined in prior research. The features were informative, as they distinguished dementia from non-dementia patients with an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.86 singly, and 0.96 when combined with participants' demographics. The correlation network of the features depicted the ""typical dementia clock"" as having a small size, a non-circular or ""avocado-like"" shape, and incorrectly placed hands.

"Unsupervised, frequent and remote: A novel platform for personalised digital phenotyping of long-term memory in humans.","Long-term memory tests are commonly used to facilitate the diagnosis of hippocampal-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease due to their relatively high specificity and sensitivity to damage to the medial temporal lobes compared to standard commonly used clinical tests. Pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease start years before the formal diagnosis is made, partially due to testing too late. This proof-of-concept exploratory study aimed to assess the feasibility of introducing an unsupervised digital platform for continuous testing of long-term memory over long periods outside the laboratory environment. To address this challenge, we developed a novel digital platform, hAge ('healthy Age'), which integrates double spatial alternation, image recognition and visuospatial tasks for frequent remote unsupervised assessment of spatial and non-spatial long-term memory carried out continuously over eight week period. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we tested whether we could achieve sufficient levels of adherence and whether the performance on hAge tasks is comparable to the performance observed in the analogous standard tests measured in the controlled laboratory environments.191 healthy adults (67% females, 18-81 years old) participated in the study. We report an estimated 42.4% adherence level with minimal inclusion criteria. In line with findings using standard laboratory tests, we showed that performance on the spatial alternation task negatively correlated with inter-trial periods and the performance levels on image recognition and visuospatial tasks could be controlled by varying image similarity. Importantly, we demonstrated that frequent engagement with the double spatial alternation task leads to a strong practice effect, previously identified as a potential measure of cognitive decline in MCI patients. Finally, we discuss how lifestyle and motivation confounds may present a serious challenge for cognitive assessment in real-world uncontrolled environments.",2023,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Long-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; Recognition, Psychology; Proof of Concept Study","Bauza, M; Krstulovic, M; Krupic, J"
Three-round learning strategy based on 3D deep convolutional GANs for Alzheimer's disease staging.,"Accurately diagnosing of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stages is critical for prompt treatment or potential intervention to delay the the disease's progression. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models have shown promising results in structural MRI (sMRI)-based diagnosis, but their performance, particularly for 3D models, is constrained by the lack of labeled training samples. To address the overfitting problem brought on by the insufficient training sample size, we propose a three-round learning strategy that combines transfer learning with generative adversarial learning. In the first round, a 3D Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) model was trained with all available sMRI data to learn the common feature of sMRI through unsupervised generative adversarial learning. The second round involved transferring and fine-tuning, and the pre-trained discriminator (D) of the DCGAN learned more specific features for the classification task between AD and cognitively normal (CN). In the final round, the weights learned in the AD versus CN classification task were transferred to the MCI diagnosis. By highlighting brain regions with high prediction weights using 3D Grad-CAM, we further enhanced the model's interpretability. The proposed model achieved accuracies of 92.8%, 78.1%, and 76.4% in the classifications of AD versus CN, AD versus MCI, and MCI versus CN, respectively. The experimental results show that our proposed model avoids overfitting brought on by a paucity of sMRI data and enables the early detection of AD.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Learning; Brain; Overweight; Cognitive Dysfunction","Kang, W; Lin, L; Sun, S; Wu, S"
Deep learning-based polygenic risk analysis for Alzheimer's disease prediction.,"The polygenic nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests that multiple variants jointly contribute to disease susceptibility. As an individual's genetic variants are constant throughout life, evaluating the combined effects of multiple disease-associated genetic risks enables reliable AD risk prediction. Because of the complexity of genomic data, current statistical analyses cannot comprehensively capture the polygenic risk of AD, resulting in unsatisfactory disease risk prediction. However, deep learning methods, which capture nonlinearity within high-dimensional genomic data, may enable more accurate disease risk prediction and improve our understanding of AD etiology. Accordingly, we developed deep learning neural network models for modeling AD polygenic risk.",2023,,,"Zhou, X; Chen, Y; Ip, FCF; Jiang, Y; Cao, H; Lv, G; Zhong, H; Chen, J; Ye, T; Chen, Y; Zhang, Y; Ma, S; Lo, RMN; Tong, EPS; Mok, VCT; Kwok, TCY; Guo, Q; Mok, KY; Shoai, M; Hardy, J; Chen, L; Fu, AKY; Ip, NY"
Reduction of vowel space in Alzheimer's disease.,"Reduced vowel space area (VSA) is a known effect of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Using large publicly available corpuses, two experiments were conducted comparing the vowel space of speakers with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD) during spontaneous and read speech. First, a comparison of vowel distance found reduced distance in AD for English spontaneous speech, but not Spanish read speech. Findings were then verified using an unsupervised learning approach to quantify VSA through cluster center detection. These results corroborate observations for PD that VSA reduction is task-dependent, but further experiments are necessary to quantify the effect of language.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech; Language; Speech Production Measurement; Parkinson Disease,"Shamei, A; Liu, Y; Gick, B"
Supervised convex clustering.,"Clustering has long been a popular unsupervised learning approach to identify groups of similar objects and discover patterns from unlabeled data in many applications. Yet, coming up with meaningful interpretations of the estimated clusters has often been challenging precisely due to their unsupervised nature. Meanwhile, in many real-world scenarios, there are some noisy supervising auxiliary variables, for instance, subjective diagnostic opinions, that are related to the observed heterogeneity of the unlabeled data. By leveraging information from both supervising auxiliary variables and unlabeled data, we seek to uncover more scientifically interpretable group structures that may be hidden by completely unsupervised analyses. In this work, we propose and develop a new statistical pattern discovery method named supervised convex clustering (SCC) that borrows strength from both information sources and guides towards finding more interpretable patterns via a joint convex fusion penalty. We develop several extensions of SCC to integrate different types of supervising auxiliary variables, to adjust for additional covariates, and to find biclusters. We demonstrate the practical advantages of SCC through simulations and a case study on Alzheimer's disease genomics. Specifically, we discover new candidate genes as well as new subtypes of Alzheimer's disease that can potentially lead to better understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for the observed heterogeneity of cognitive decline in older adults.",2023,convex clustering; exponential family; generalized linear model deviance; interpretable clustering; supervised clustering,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Genomics; Cluster Analysis,"Wang, M; Yao, T; Allen, GI"
Uncovering spatiotemporal patterns of atrophy in progressive supranuclear palsy using unsupervised machine learning.,"To better understand the pathological and phenotypic heterogeneity of progressive supranuclear palsy and the links between the two, we applied a novel unsupervised machine learning algorithm (Subtype and Stage Inference) to the largest MRI data set to date of people with clinically diagnosed progressive supranuclear palsy (including progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson and variant progressive supranuclear palsy syndromes). Our cohort is comprised of 426 progressive supranuclear palsy cases, of which 367 had at least one follow-up scan, and 290 controls. Of the progressive supranuclear palsy cases, 357 were clinically diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson, 52 with a progressive supranuclear palsy-cortical variant (progressive supranuclear palsy-frontal, progressive supranuclear palsy-speech/language, or progressive supranuclear palsy-corticobasal), and 17 with a progressive supranuclear palsy-subcortical variant (progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism or progressive supranuclear palsy-progressive gait freezing). Subtype and Stage Inference was applied to volumetric MRI features extracted from baseline structural (T1-weighted) MRI scans and then used to subtype and stage follow-up scans. The subtypes and stages at follow-up were used to validate the longitudinal consistency of subtype and stage assignments. We further compared the clinical phenotypes of each subtype to gain insight into the relationship between progressive supranuclear palsy pathology, atrophy patterns, and clinical presentation. The data supported two subtypes, each with a distinct progression of atrophy: a 'subcortical' subtype, in which early atrophy was most prominent in the brainstem, ventral diencephalon, superior cerebellar peduncles, and the dentate nucleus, and a 'cortical' subtype, in which there was early atrophy in the frontal lobes and the insula alongside brainstem atrophy. There was a strong association between clinical diagnosis and the Subtype and Stage Inference subtype with 82% of progressive supranuclear palsy-subcortical cases and 81% of progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson cases assigned to the subcortical subtype and 82% of progressive supranuclear palsy-cortical cases assigned to the cortical subtype. The increasing stage was associated with worsening clinical scores, whilst the 'subcortical' subtype was associated with worse clinical severity scores compared to the 'cortical subtype' (progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Validation experiments showed that subtype assignment was longitudinally stable (95% of scans were assigned to the same subtype at follow-up) and individual staging was longitudinally consistent with 90% remaining at the same stage or progressing to a later stage at follow-up. In summary, we applied Subtype and Stage Inference to structural MRI data and empirically identified two distinct subtypes of spatiotemporal atrophy in progressive supranuclear palsy. These image-based subtypes were differentially enriched for progressive supranuclear palsy clinical syndromes and showed different clinical characteristics. Being able to accurately subtype and stage progressive supranuclear palsy patients at baseline has important implications for screening patients on entry to clinical trials, as well as tracking disease progression.",2023,Subtype and Stage Inference; biomarkers; disease progression; machine learning; progressive supranuclear palsy,,"Scotton, WJ; Shand, C; Todd, E; Bocchetta, M; Cash, DM; VandeVrede, L; Heuer, H; Young, AL; Oxtoby, N; Alexander, DC; Rowe, JB; Morris, HR; Boxer, AL; Rohrer, JD; Wijeratne, PA"

DeAF: A multimodal deep learning framework for disease prediction.,"Multimodal deep learning models have been applied for disease prediction tasks, but difficulties exist in training due to the conflict between sub-models and fusion modules. To alleviate this issue, we propose a framework for decoupling feature alignment and fusion (DeAF), which separates the multimodal model training into two stages. In the first stage, unsupervised representation learning is conducted, and the modality adaptation (MA) module is used to align the features from various modalities. In the second stage, the self-attention fusion (SAF) module combines the medical image features and clinical data using supervised learning. Moreover, we apply the DeAF framework to predict the postoperative efficacy of CRS for colorectal cancer and whether the MCI patients change to Alzheimer's disease. The DeAF framework achieves a significant improvement in comparison to the previous methods. Furthermore, extensive ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of our framework. In conclusion, our framework enhances the interaction between the local medical image features and clinical data, and derive more discriminative multimodal features for disease prediction.

Harnessing the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for dementia research.,"Progress in dementia research has been limited, with substantial gaps in our knowledge of targets for prevention, mechanisms for disease progression, and disease-modifying treatments. The growing availability of multimodal data sets opens possibilities for the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to help answer key questions in the field. We provide an overview of the state of the science, highlighting current challenges and opportunities for utilisation of AI approaches to move the field forward in the areas of genetics, experimental medicine, drug discovery and trials optimisation, imaging, and prevention. Machine learning methods can enhance results of genetic studies, help determine biological effects and facilitate the identification of drug targets based on genetic and transcriptomic information. The use of unsupervised learning for understanding disease mechanisms for drug discovery is promising, while analysis of multimodal data sets to characterise and quantify disease severity and subtype are also beginning to contribute to optimisation of clinical trial recruitment. Data-driven experimental medicine is needed to analyse data across modalities and develop novel algorithms to translate insights from animal models to human disease biology. AI methods in neuroimaging outperform traditional approaches for diagnostic classification, and although challenges around validation and translation remain, there is optimism for their meaningful integration to clinical practice in the near future. AI-based models can also clarify our understanding of the causality and commonality of dementia risk factors, informing and improving risk prediction models along with the development of preventative interventions. The complexity and heterogeneity of dementia requires an alternative approach beyond traditional design and analytical approaches.

Multi-region brain transcriptomes uncover two subtypes of aging individuals with differences in Alzheimer risk and the impact of ,"The heterogeneity of the older population suggests the existence of subsets of individuals which share certain brain molecular features and respond differently to risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, but this population structure remains poorly defined. Here, we performed an unsupervised clustering of individuals with multi-region brain transcriptomes to assess whether a broader approach, simultaneously considering data from multiple regions involved in cognition would uncover such subsets. We implemented a canonical correlation-based analysis in a Discovery cohort of 459 participants from two longitudinal studies of cognitive aging that have RNA sequence profiles in three brain regions. 690 additional participants that have data in only one or two of these regions were used in the Replication effort. These clustering analyses identified two meta-clusters, MC-1 and MC-2. The two sets of participants differ primarily in their trajectories of cognitive decline, with MC-2 having a delay of 3 years to the median age of incident dementia. This is due, in part, to a greater impact of tau pathology on neuronal chromatin architecture and to broader brain changes including greater loss of white matter integrity in MC-1.

Deciphering the clinico-radiological heterogeneity of dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease.,"Dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease (dAD) manifests as a progressive dysexecutive syndrome without prominent behavioral features, and previous studies suggest clinico-radiological heterogeneity within this syndrome. We uncovered this heterogeneity using unsupervised machine learning in 52 dAD patients with multimodal imaging and cognitive data. A spectral decomposition of covariance between FDG-PET images yielded six latent factors (""eigenbrains"") accounting for 48% of variance in patterns of hypometabolism. These eigenbrains differentially related to age at onset, clinical severity, and cognitive performance. A hierarchical clustering on the eigenvalues of these eigenbrains yielded four dAD subtypes, i.e. ""left-dominant,"" ""right-dominant,"" ""bi-parietal-dominant,"" and ""heteromodal-diffuse."" Patterns of FDG-PET hypometabolism overlapped with those of tau-PET distribution and MRI neurodegeneration for each subtype, whereas patterns of amyloid deposition were similar across subtypes. Subtypes differed in age at onset and clinical severity where the heteromodal-diffuse exhibited a worse clinical picture, and the bi-parietal had a milder clinical presentation. We propose a conceptual framework of executive components based on the clinico-radiological associations observed in dAD. We demonstrate that patients with dAD, despite sharing core clinical features, are diagnosed with variability in their clinical and neuroimaging profiles.

Predictive Models and Features of Patient Mortality across Dementia Types.,"Dementia care is challenging due to the divergent trajectories in disease progression and outcomes.

Here, we developed machine learning models predicting survival using a dataset of 45,275 unique participants and 163,782 visit records from the U.S. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Our models achieved an AUC-ROC of over 0.82 utilizing nine parsimonious features for all one-, three-, five-, and ten-year thresholds. The trained models mainly consisted of dementia-related predictors such as specific neuropsychological tests and were minimally affected by other age-related causes of death, e.g., stroke and cardiovascular conditions. Notably, stratified analyses revealed shared and distinct predictors of mortality across eight dementia types. Unsupervised clustering of mortality predictors grouped vascular dementia with depression and Lewy body dementia with frontotemporal lobar dementia.

Classifying Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia using machine learning with cross-sectional and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are common causes of dementia with partly overlapping, symptoms and brain signatures. There is a need to establish an accurate diagnosis and to obtain markers for disease tracking. We combined unsupervised and supervised machine learning to discriminate between AD and FTD using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We included baseline 3T-T1 MRI data from 339 subjects: 99 healthy controls (CTR), 153 AD and 87 FTD patients; and 2-year follow-up data from 114 subjects. We obtained subcortical gray matter volumes and cortical thickness measures using FreeSurfer. We used dimensionality reduction to obtain a single feature that was later used in a support vector machine for classification. Discrimination patterns were obtained with the contribution of each region to the single feature. Our algorithm differentiated CTR versus AD and CTR versus FTD at the cross-sectional level with 83.3% and 82.1% of accuracy. These increased up to 90.0% and 88.0% with longitudinal data. When we studied the classification between AD versus FTD we obtained an accuracy of 63.3% at the cross-sectional level and 75.0% for longitudinal data. The AD versus FTD versus CTR classification has reached an accuracy of 60.7%, and 71.3% for cross-sectional and longitudinal data respectively. Disease discrimination brain maps are in concordance with previous results obtained with classical approaches. By using a single feature, we were capable to classify CTR, AD, and FTD with good accuracy, considering the inherent overlap between diseases.

Functional genomics provide key insights to improve the diagnostic yield of hereditary ataxia.,"Improvements in functional genomic annotation have led to a critical mass of neurogenetic discoveries. This is exemplified in hereditary ataxia, a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by incoordination from cerebellar dysfunction. Associated pathogenic variants in more than 300 genes have been described, leading to a detailed genetic classification partitioned by age-of-onset. Despite these advances, up to 75% of patients with ataxia remain molecularly undiagnosed even following whole genome sequencing, as exemplified in the 100 000 Genomes Project. This study aimed to understand whether we can improve our knowledge of the genetic architecture of hereditary ataxia by leveraging functional genomic annotations, and as a result, generate insights and strategies that raise the diagnostic yield. To achieve these aims, we used publicly-available multi-omics data to generate 294 genic features, capturing information relating to a gene's structure, genetic variation, tissue-specific, cell-type-specific and temporal expression, as well as protein products of a gene. We studied these features across genes typically causing childhood-onset, adult-onset or both types of disease first individually, then collectively. This led to the generation of testable hypotheses which we investigated using whole genome sequencing data from up to 2182 individuals presenting with ataxia and 6658 non-neurological probands recruited in the 100 000 Genomes Project. Using this approach, we demonstrated a high short tandem repeat (STR) density within childhood-onset genes suggesting that we may be missing pathogenic repeat expansions within this cohort. This was verified in both childhood- and adult-onset ataxia patients from the 100 000 Genomes Project who were unexpectedly found to have a trend for higher repeat sizes even at naturally-occurring STRs within known ataxia genes, implying a role for STRs in pathogenesis. Using unsupervised analysis, we found significant similarities in genomic annotation across the gene panels, which suggested adult- and childhood-onset patients should be screened using a common diagnostic gene set. We tested this within the 100 000 Genomes Project by assessing the burden of pathogenic variants among childhood-onset genes in adult-onset patients and vice versa. This demonstrated a significantly higher burden of rare, potentially pathogenic variants in conventional childhood-onset genes among individuals with adult-onset ataxia. Our analysis has implications for the current clinical practice in genetic testing for hereditary ataxia. We suggest that the diagnostic rate for hereditary ataxia could be increased by removing the age-of-onset partition, and through a modified screening for repeat expansions in naturally-occurring STRs within known ataxia-associated genes, in effect treating these regions as candidate pathogenic loci.",2023,functional genomics; hereditary ataxia; rare disease; repeat expansion disorders; transcriptomics,Adult; Humans; Spinocerebellar Degenerations; Cerebellar Ataxia; Ataxia; Genomics; Genetic Testing,"Chen, Z; Tucci, A; Cipriani, V; Gustavsson, EK; Ibañez, K; Reynolds, RH; Zhang, D; Vestito, L; García, AC; Sethi, S; Brenton, JW; García-Ruiz, S; Fairbrother-Browne, A; Gil-Martinez, AL; Wood, N; Hardy, JA; Smedley, D; Houlden, H; Botía, J; Ryten, M"
Artificial intelligence-driven meta-analysis of brain gene expression identifies novel gene candidates and a role for mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. There is no treatment and AD models have focused on a small subset of genes identified in familial AD. Microarray studies have identified thousands of dysregulated genes in the brains of patients with AD yet identifying the best gene candidates to both model and treat AD remains a challenge. We performed a meta-analysis of microarray data from the frontal cortex (n = 697) and cerebellum (n = 230) of AD patients and healthy controls. A two-stage artificial intelligence approach, with both unsupervised and supervised machine learning, combined with a functional network analysis was used to identify functionally connected and biologically relevant novel gene candidates in AD. We found that in the frontal cortex, genes involved in mitochondrial energy, ATP, and oxidative phosphorylation, were the most significant dysregulated genes. In the cerebellum, dysregulated genes were involved in mitochondrial cellular biosynthesis (mitochondrial ribosomes). Although there was little overlap between dysregulated genes between the frontal cortex and cerebellum, machine learning models comprised of this overlap. A further functional network analysis of these genes identified that two downregulated genes, ATP5L and ATP5H, which both encode subunits of ATP synthase (mitochondrial complex V) may play a role in AD. Combined, our results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly a deficit in energy homeostasis, may play an important role in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Gene expression; Machine learning; Microarray; Mitochondria,,"Finney, CA; Delerue, F; Gold, WA; Brown, DA; Shvetcov, A"

Participants (n = 10) enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center completed four or more lumbar punctures. These individuals were cognitively normal at baseline. Cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid-β (Aβ)42, phosphorylated tau (pTau181), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) as well as proteomics values were evaluated. Imaging biomarkers, including PET amyloid and tau, and structural MRI, were repeatedly obtained when available. Individuals were staged according to the amyloid-tau-(neurodegeneration) framework. Growth mixture modelling, an unsupervised clustering technique, identified three patterns of biomarker progression as measured by CSF pTau181 and Aβ42. Two groups (AD Biomarker Positive and Intermediate AD Biomarker) showed distinct progression from normal biomarker status to having biomarkers consistent with preclinical AD. A third group (AD Biomarker Negative) did not develop abnormal AD biomarkers over time. Participants grouped by CSF trajectories were re-classified using only proteomic profiles (AUCAD Biomarker Positive versus AD Biomarker Negative = 0.857, AUCAD Biomarker Positive versus Intermediate AD Biomarkers = 0.525, AUCIntermediate AD Biomarkers versus AD Biomarker Negative = 0.952). We highlight heterogeneity in the development of AD biomarkers in cognitively normal individuals. We identified some individuals who became amyloid positive before the age of 50 years. A second group, Intermediate AD Biomarkers, developed elevated CSF ptau181 significantly before becoming amyloid positive. A third group were AD Biomarker Negative over repeated testing. Our results could influence the selection of participants for specific treatments (e.g. amyloid-reducing versus other agents) in clinical trials. CSF proteome analysis highlighted additional non-AT(N) biomarkers for potential therapies, including blood-brain barrier-, vascular-, immune-, and neuroinflammatory-related targets.",2023,Alzheimer disease; biomarkers; heterogeneity; machine learning; proteome,Humans; Middle Aged; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Disease Progression,"Wisch, JK; Butt, OH; Gordon, BA; Schindler, SE; Fagan, AM; Henson, RL; Yang, C; Boerwinkle, AH; Benzinger, TLS; Holtzman, DM; Morris, JC; Cruchaga, C; Ances, BM"
Association of Major Depressive Disorder with remotely administered measures of cognition and subjective report of cognitive difficulties across the adult age spectrum.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) has increasing prevalence with age. Both objective measures of cognitive dysfunction and subjective report of cognitive difficulties related to MDD are often thought to worsen with increasing age. However, few studies have directly evaluated these characteristics across the adult lifespan.",2023,Cognition; Internet; Major depression; Remote assessment; Subjective cognitive,"Middle Aged; Young Adult; Humans; Aged; Adult; Depressive Disorder, Major; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Self Report; Neuropsychological Tests","Mackin, RS; Jin, C; Burns, E; Kassel, M; Rhodes, E; Nosheny, R; Ashford, M; Banh, T; Eichenbaum, J; Knight, K; Tank, R; Camacho, MR; Fockler, J; Truran, D; Neuhaus, J; Weiner, M"
Semisupervised white matter hyperintensities segmentation on MRI.,"This study proposed a semisupervised loss function named level-set loss (LSLoss) for cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) segmentation on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. The training procedure did not require manually labeled WMH masks. Our image preprocessing steps included biased field correction, skull stripping, and white matter segmentation. With the proposed LSLoss, we trained a V-Net using the MRI images from both local and public databases. Local databases were the small vessel disease cohort (HKU-SVD, n = 360) and the multiple sclerosis cohort (HKU-MS, n = 20) from our institutional imaging center. Public databases were the Medical Image Computing Computer-assisted Intervention (MICCAI) WMH challenge database (MICCAI-WMH, n = 60) and the normal control cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI-CN, n = 15). We achieved an overall dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.81 on the HKU-SVD testing set (n = 20), DSC = 0.77 on the HKU-MS testing set (n = 5), and DSC = 0.78 on MICCAI-WMH testing set (n = 30). The segmentation results obtained by our semisupervised V-Net were comparable with the supervised methods and outperformed the unsupervised methods in the literature.",2023,brain MRI; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; segmentation; semisupervised learning; small vessel diseases; white matter hyperintensities,"Humans; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Alzheimer Disease; Skull; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain","Huang, F; Xia, P; Vardhanabhuti, V; Hui, SK; Lau, KK; Ka-Fung Mak, H; Cao, P"
Alternative pathway dysregulation in tissues drives sustained complement activation and predicts outcome across the disease course in COVID-19.,"Complement, a critical defence against pathogens, has been implicated as a driver of pathology in COVID-19. Complement activation products are detected in plasma and tissues and complement blockade is considered for therapy. To delineate roles of complement in immunopathogenesis, we undertook the largest comprehensive study of complement in COVID-19 to date, comprehensive profiling of 16 complement biomarkers, including key components, regulators and activation products, in 966 plasma samples from 682 hospitalized COVID-19 patients collected across the hospitalization period as part of the UK ISARIC4C (International Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) study. Unsupervised clustering of complement biomarkers mapped to disease severity and supervised machine learning identified marker sets in early samples that predicted peak severity. Compared to healthy controls, complement proteins and activation products (Ba, iC3b, terminal complement complex) were significantly altered in COVID-19 admission samples in all severity groups. Elevated alternative pathway activation markers (Ba and iC3b) and decreased alternative pathway regulator (properdin) in admission samples were associated with more severe disease and risk of death. Levels of most complement biomarkers were reduced in severe disease, consistent with consumption and tissue deposition. Latent class mixed modelling and cumulative incidence analysis identified the trajectory of increase of Ba to be a strong predictor of peak COVID-19 disease severity and death. The data demonstrate that early-onset, uncontrolled activation of complement, driven by sustained and progressive amplification through the alternative pathway amplification loop is a ubiquitous feature of COVID-19, further exacerbated in severe disease. These findings provide novel insights into COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and inform strategies for therapeutic intervention.",2023,COVID-19; alternative pathway; biomarkers; complement,"Humans; COVID-19; Complement Activation; Complement System Proteins; Complement C3b; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Complement Pathway, Alternative","Siggins, MK; Davies, K; Fellows, R; Thwaites, RS; Baillie, JK; Semple, MG; Openshaw, PJM; Zelek, WM; Harris, CL; Morgan, BP"
