Characterization of local white matter microstructural alterations in Alzheimer's disease: A reproducible study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a close association with microstructural alterations in white matter (WM). Current studies lack the characterization and further validation of specific regions in WM fiber tracts in AD. This study subdivided fiber tracts into multiple fiber clusters on the basis of automated fiber clustering and performed quantitative analysis along the fiber clusters to identify local WM microstructural alterations in AD. Diffusion tensor imaging data from a public dataset (53 patients with AD and 70 healthy controls [HCs]) and a clinical dataset (27 patients with AD and 19 HCs) were included for mutual validation. Whole-brain tractograms were automatically subdivided into 800 clusters through the automatic fiber clustering approach. Then, 100 segments were divided along the clusters, and the diffusion properties of each segment were calculated. Results showed that patients with AD had significantly lower fraction anisotropy (FA) and significantly higher mean diffusivity (MD) in some regions of the fiber clusters in the cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, external capsule, and corpus callosum than HCs. Importantly, these changes were reproducible across the two datasets. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between FA and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and a negative correlation between MD and MMSE in these clusters. The accuracy of the constructed classifier reached 89.76% with an area under the curve of 0.93. This finding indicates that this study can effectively identify local WM microstructural changes in AD and provides new insight into the analysis and diagnosis of WM abnormalities in patients with AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Automated fiber clustering; Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; White matter,,"Wen, C; Zeng, Q; Zhou, R; Xie, L; Yu, J; Zhang, C; Wang, J; Yu, Y; Gu, Y; Cao, G; Feng, Y; Wang, M"
Optimized efficient attention-based network for facial expressions analysis in neurological health care.,"Facial Expression Analysis (FEA) plays a vital role in diagnosing and treating early-stage neurological disorders (NDs) like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Manual FEA is hindered by expertise, time, and training requirements, while automatic methods confront difficulties with real patient data unavailability, high computations, and irrelevant feature extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach: an efficient, lightweight convolutional block attention module (CBAM) based deep learning network (DLN) to aid doctors in diagnosing ND patients. The method comprises two stages: data collection of real ND patients, and pre-processing, involving face detection and an attention-enhanced DLN for feature extraction and refinement. Extensive experiments with validation on real patient data showcase compelling performance, achieving an accuracy of up to 73.2%. Despite its efficacy, the proposed model is lightweight, occupying only 3MB, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained mobile healthcare devices. Moreover, the method exhibits significant advancements over existing FEA approaches, holding tremendous promise in effectively diagnosing and treating ND patients. By accurately recognizing emotions and extracting relevant features, this approach empowers medical professionals in early ND detection and management, overcoming the challenges of manual analysis and heavy models. In conclusion, this research presents a significant leap in FEA, promising to enhance ND diagnosis and care.The code and data used in this work are available at: https://github.com/munsif200/Neurological-Health-Care.",2024,Deep learning; Facial expression analysis; Information processing; Mobile health care; Neurological disorder; Parkinson,,"Munsif, M; Sajjad, M; Ullah, M; Tarekegn, AN; Cheikh, FA; Tsakanikas, P; Muhammad, K"
Assessing CT-based Volumetric Analysis via Transfer Learning with MRI and Manual Labels for Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"Brain computed tomography (CT) is an accessible and commonly utilized technique for assessing brain structure. In cases of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), the presence of ventriculomegaly is often neuroradiologically evaluated by visual rating and manually measuring each image. Previously, we have developed and tested a deep-learning-model that utilizes transfer learning from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CT-based intracranial tissue segmentation. Accordingly, herein we aimed to enhance the segmentation of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (VCSF) in brain CT scans and assess the performance of automated brain CT volumetrics in iNPH patient diagnostics.",2024,CNNs; CT; MRI; deep learning; hydrocephalus; volumetry,,"Srikrishna, M; Seo, W; Zettergren, A; Kern, S; Cantré, D; Gessler, F; Sotoudeh, H; Seidlitz, J; Bernstock, JD; Wahlund, LO; Westman, E; Skoog, I; Virhammar, J; Fällmar, D; Schöll, M"
Artificial intelligence in Parkinson's disease: Early detection and diagnostic advancements.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, globally affecting men and women at an exponentially growing rate, with currently no cure. Disease progression starts when dopaminergic neurons begin to die. In PD, the loss of neurotransmitter, dopamine is responsible for the overall communication of neural cells throughout the body. Clinical symptoms of PD are slowness of movement, involuntary muscular contractions, speech & writing changes, lessened automatic movement, and chronic tremors in the body. PD occurs in both familial and sporadic forms and modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors and socioeconomic conditions cause PD. Early detectable diagnostics and treatments have been developed in the last several decades. However, we still do not have precise early detectable biomarkers and therapeutic agents/drugs that prevent and/or delay the disease process. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) science and machine learning tools have been promising in identifying early detectable markers with a greater rate of accuracy compared to past forms of treatment and diagnostic processes. Artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence exhibited by machines or software, distinct from the intelligence observed in humans that is based on neural networks in a form and can be used to diagnose the longevity and disease severity of disease. The term Machine Learning or Neural Networks is a blanket term used to identify an emerging technology that is created to work in the way of a ""human brain"" using many intertwined neurons to achieve the same level of raw intelligence as that of a brain. These processes have been used for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, to assess the severity of the patient's condition. In the current article, we discuss the prevalence and incidence of PD, and currently available diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We also highlighted currently available artificial intelligence science and machine learning tools and their applications to detect disease and develop therapeutic interventions.",2024,Artificial intelligence; Early detectable biomarkers; Machine learning tools; Parkinson’s disease; Therapeutic strategies,,"Reddy, A; Reddy, RP; Roghani, AK; Garcia, RI; Khemka, S; Pattoor, V; Jacob, M; Reddy, PH; Sehar, U"
Quantifying impairment and disease severity using AI models trained on healthy subjects.,"Automatic assessment of impairment and disease severity is a key challenge in data-driven medicine. We propose a framework to address this challenge, which leverages AI models trained exclusively on healthy individuals. The COnfidence-Based chaRacterization of Anomalies (COBRA) score exploits the decrease in confidence of these models when presented with impaired or diseased patients to quantify their deviation from the healthy population. We applied the COBRA score to address a key limitation of current clinical evaluation of upper-body impairment in stroke patients. The gold-standard Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) requires in-person administration by a trained assessor for 30-45 minutes, which restricts monitoring frequency and precludes physicians from adapting rehabilitation protocols to the progress of each patient. The COBRA score, computed automatically in under one minute, is shown to be strongly correlated with the FMA on an independent test cohort for two different data modalities: wearable sensors (ρ = 0.814, 95% CI [0.700,0.888]) and video (ρ = 0.736, 95% C.I [0.584, 0.838]). To demonstrate the generalizability of the approach to other conditions, the COBRA score was also applied to quantify severity of knee osteoarthritis from magnetic-resonance imaging scans, again achieving significant correlation with an independent clinical assessment (ρ = 0.644, 95% C.I [0.585,0.696]).",2024,,,"Yu, B; Kaku, A; Liu, K; Parnandi, A; Fokas, E; Venkatesan, A; Pandit, N; Ranganath, R; Schambra, H; Fernandez-Granda, C"
An Overview of the ADReSS-M Signal Processing Grand Challenge on Multilingual Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition Through Spontaneous Speech.,"The ADReSS-M Signal Processing Grand Challenge was held at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2023. The challenge targeted difficult automatic prediction problems of great societal and medical relevance, namely, the detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and the estimation of cognitive test scoress. Participants were invited to create models for the assessment of cognitive function based on spontaneous speech data. Most of these models employed signal processing and machine learning methods. The ADReSS-M challenge was designed to assess the extent to which predictive models built based on speech in one language generalise to another language. The language data compiled and made available for ADReSS-M comprised English, for model training, and Greek, for model testing and validation. To the best of our knowledge no previous shared research task investigated acoustic features of the speech signal or linguistic characteristics in the context of multilingual AD detection. This paper describes the context of the ADReSS-M challenge, its data sets, its predictive tasks, the evaluation methodology we employed, our baseline models and results, and the top five submissions. The paper concludes with a summary discussion of the ADReSS-M results, and our critical assessment of the future outlook in this field.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomedical signal processing; human disease biomarkers; medical conditions; multilingual Alzheimer’s dementia detection; natural language processing; speech processing,,"Luz, S; Haider, F; Fromm, D; Lazarou, I; Kompatsiaris, I; Macwhinney, B"
Prolonged ventricular repolarization associated with mild cognitive impairment and white matter hyperintensities: a cross-sectional study.,"Prolonged ventricular repolarization has been associated with cardiovascular disease. We sought to investigate the association of prolonged ventricular repolarization with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the potential underlying neuropathological mechanisms in older adults. This cross-sectional study included 4328 dementia-free participants (age ≥ 65 years; 56.8% female) in the baseline examination of the Multidomain INterventions to delay dementia and Disability in rural China; of these, 989 undertook structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. QT, QTc, JT, JTc, and QRS intervals were derived from 12-lead electrocardiograph. MCI, amnestic MCI (aMCI), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) were defined following the Petersen's criteria. Volumes of gray matter (GM), white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, total white matter hyperintensities (WMH), periventricular WMH (PWMH), and deep WMH (DWMH) were automatically estimated. Data were analyzed using logistic and general linear regression models. Prolonged QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of MCI and aMCI, but not naMCI (p < 0.05). In the MRI subsample, QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals were significantly associated with larger total WMH and PWMH volumes (p < 0.05), but not with DWMH volume. Statistical interactions were detected, such that prolonged QT and JT intervals were significantly associated with reduced GM volume only among participants with coronary heart disease or without APOE ε4 allele (p < 0.05). Prolonged ventricular repolarization is associated with MCI and cerebral microvascular lesions in a general population of older adults. This underlies the importance of cognitive assessments and brain MRI examination among older adults with prolonged QT interval.",2024,Cross-sectional study; Electrocardiogram; Mild cognitive impairment; Prolonged ventricular repolarization; White matter hyperintensities,"Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Male; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Electrocardiography; Aged, 80 and over; Gray Matter; China","Mao, M; Wei, Y; Wang, C; Han, X; Liu, R; Dong, Y; Song, L; Cong, L; Wang, Y; Du, Y; Qiu, C"
Cortex-to-caudate volume ratio as a predictor of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,Brain and cortical atrophy play crucial roles in supporting the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study hypothesized that the ratios of brain or cortical volume to subcortical gray matter structure volumes are potential imaging markers for cognitive alterations in AD dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).,2024,Cognition; Dementia; Image analysis,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Female; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cerebral Cortex; Neuropsychological Tests; Aged, 80 and over; Organ Size; Follow-Up Studies; Middle Aged; Disease Progression; Atrophy","Na, S; Kim, T; Song, IU; Hong, YJ; Kim, SH"
Residual-Based Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Computer-Aided Alzheimer's Disease Detection.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) poses a significant health risk globally, particularly among the elderly population. Recent studies underscore its prevalence, with over 50% of elderly Japanese facing a lifetime risk of dementia, primarily attributed to AD. As the most prevalent form of dementia, AD gradually erodes brain cells, leading to severe neurological decline. In this scenario, it is important to develop an automatic AD-detection system, and many researchers have been working to develop an AD-detection system by taking advantage of the advancement of deep learning (DL) techniques, which have shown promising results in various domains, including medical image analysis. However, existing approaches for AD detection often suffer from limited performance due to the complexities associated with training hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-stage deep neural network architecture based on residual functions to address the limitations of existing AD-detection approaches. Inspired by the success of residual networks (ResNets) in image-classification tasks, our proposed system comprises five stages, each explicitly formulated to enhance feature effectiveness while maintaining model depth. Following feature extraction, a deep learning-based feature-selection module is applied to mitigate overfitting, incorporating batch normalization, dropout and fully connected layers. Subsequently, machine learning (ML)-based classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and SoftMax, are employed for classification tasks. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T, MIRAID and OASIS Kaggle, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model. Impressively, our model achieves accuracy rates of 99.47%, 99.10% and 99.70% for ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T, MIRAID and OASIS datasets, respectively, outperforming existing systems in binary class problems. Our proposed model represents a significant advancement in the AD-analysis domain.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; CNN; Random Forest; machine learning; residual network,,"Hassan, N; Musa Miah, AS; Shin, J"
A Telemedicine Analytic Framework for Fully and Semi-automatic Alzheimer's Disease Screening using Clock Drawing Test.,"More than 6 million Americans are at risk for Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD), most of whom are 65 or older. The clock drawing test (CDT) is a quick, simple, and effective technique that has the potential advantage of self-management and screening for ADRD patients. Current CDT-based ADRD screening studies focus more on efficacy, involving many handcrafted features, ignoring data modalities, and lacking validation. This paper aims to propose a unified telemedicine framework for fully and semi-automatic effective early ADRD screening based on multimodal and agile data fusion, focusing on the interpretability and validation of the model by using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and locally linear embedding (LLE). The datasets for this work include 1,662 samples of CDT images and related demographic and cognitive information. The fully automatic case involving only CDT images can achieve the highest AUC of 81% with a 75% recall rate in binary screening. The multimodal data fusion in the semi-automatic case can achieve up to 90% AUC with an 83% recall rate. The visualization of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) shows that it can automatically obtain critical information about the outline, scale, and clock hands from CDT images, and the analysis of structured features shows that the memory test is key to effective ADRD screening.",2024,,,"Bo, W; Sullivan, SS; Zhang, X; Gao, M; Xu, W"
The relationship between cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensities in mid to late life.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with cortical thinning. Although they are primarily detected in older participants, these lesions can appear in younger and midlife individuals. Here, we tested whether WMH are associated with cortical thinning in relatively younger (26-50 years) and relatively older (58-84) participants who were free of dementia, and how these associations are moderated by WMH localization. WMH were automatically quantified and categorized according to the localization of three classes of white matter tracts: association, commissural and projection fibers. Mediation analyses were used to infer whether differences in cortical thickness between younger and older participants were explained by WMH. Our results revealed that total WMH explained between 20.6 % and 65.5 % of the effect of age on cortical thickness in AD-signature regions including the lateral temporal lobes and supramarginal gyrus, among others. This mediation was slightly stronger for projection WMH, although it was still significant for association and commissural WMH. These results suggest that there is an interplay between vascular and AD causes of cognitive impairment that starts at younger ages.",2024,Cerebrovascular disease; Cognitive impairment; Cortical thickness; Neuroimaging; White matter hyperintensities,"Humans; White Matter; Aged; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Adult; Aging; Cerebral Cortex; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction","Jiménez-Balado, J; Habeck, C; Stern, Y; Eich, T"
A spatiotemporal graph transformer approach for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis with rs-fMRI.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease accompanied by cognitive impairment. Early diagnosis is crucial for the timely treatment and intervention of AD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) records the temporal dynamics and spatial dependency in the brain, which have been utilized for automatically diagnosis of AD in the community. Existing approaches of AD diagnosis using rs-fMRI only assess functional connectivity, ignoring the spatiotemporal dependency mining of rs-fMRI. In addition, it is difficult to increase diagnosis accuracy due to the shortage of rs-fMRI sample and the poor anti-noise ability of model. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach for the automatic diagnosis of AD, namely spatiotemporal graph transformer network (STGTN). The proposed STGTN can effectively extract spatiotemporal features of rs-fMRI. Furthermore, to solve the sample-limited problem and to improve the anti-noise ability of the proposed model, an adversarial training strategy is adopted for the proposed STGTN to generate adversarial examples (AEs) and augment training samples with AEs. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves the classification accuracy of 92.58%, and 85.27% with the adversarial training strategy for AD vs. normal control (NC), early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) vs. late mild cognitive impairment (lMCI) respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the spatial attention coefficients reflected from the designed model reveal the importance of brain connections under different classification tasks.",2024,AD diagnosis; Adversarial training; Spatiotemporal feature; rs-fMRI,,"He, P; Shi, Z; Cui, Y; Wang, R; Wu, D"
A feature-aware multimodal framework with auto-fusion for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common dementias, has about 4.6 million new cases yearly worldwide. Due to the significant amount of suspected AD patients, early screening for the disease has become particularly important. There are diversified types of AD diagnosis data, such as cognitive tests, images, and risk factors, many prior investigations have primarily concentrated on integrating only high-dimensional features and simple fusion concatenation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes for AD diagnosis. Therefore, We propose an enhanced multimodal AD diagnostic framework comprising a feature-aware module and an automatic model fusion strategy (AMFS). To preserve the correlation and significance features within a low-dimensional space, the feature-aware module employs a low-dimensional SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) boosting feature selection as the initial step, following this analysis, diverse tiers of low-dimensional features are extracted from patients' biological data. Besides, in the high-dimensional stage, the feature-aware module integrates cross-modal attention mechanisms to capture subtle relationships among different cognitive domains, neuroimaging modalities, and risk factors. Subsequently, we integrate the aforementioned feature-aware module with graph convolutional networks (GCN) to address heterogeneous data in multimodal AD, while also possessing the capability to perceive relationships between different modalities. Lastly, our proposed AMFS autonomously learns optimal parameters for aligning two sub-models. The validation tests using two ADNI datasets show the high accuracies of 95.9% and 91.9% respectively, in AD diagnosis. The methods efficiently select features from multimodal AD data, optimizing model fusion for potential clinical assistance in diagnostics.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Attention mechanisms; Feature selection; Graph neural networks; Multimodal AD diagnosis,,"Zhang, M; Cui, Q; Lü, Y; Li, W"

Machine learning of dissection photographs and surface scanning for quantitative 3D neuropathology.,"We present open-source tools for three-dimensional (3D) analysis of photographs of dissected slices of human brains, which are routinely acquired in brain banks but seldom used for quantitative analysis. Our tools can: (1) 3D reconstruct a volume from the photographs and, optionally, a surface scan; and (2) produce a high-resolution 3D segmentation into 11 brain regions per hemisphere (22 in total), independently of the slice thickness. Our tools can be used as a substitute for ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which requires access to an MRI scanner, ex vivo scanning expertise, and considerable ﬁnancial resources. We tested our tools on synthetic and real data from two NIH Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers.

AI-based mining of biomedical literature: Applications for drug repurposing for the treatment of dementia.,"Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and others significantly affect individuals, their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. While there are no cures yet, researchers worldwide are actively working on the development of novel treatments that have the potential to slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and ultimately improve the overall health of patients. Huge volumes of new scientific information necessitate new analytical approaches for meaningful hypothesis generation. To enable the automatic analysis of biomedical data we introduced AGATHA, an effective AI-based literature mining tool that can navigate massive scientific literature databases, such as PubMed. The overarching goal of this effort is to adapt AGATHA for drug repurposing by revealing hidden connections between FDA-approved medications and a health condition of interest. Our tool converts the abstracts of peer-reviewed papers from PubMed into multidimensional space where each gene and health condition are represented by specific metrics. We implemented advanced statistical analysis to reveal distinct clusters of scientific terms within the virtual space created using AGATHA-calculated parameters for selected health conditions and genes. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was employed for categorizing and predicting samples (122 diseases and 20889 genes) fitted to specific classes. Advanced statistics were employed to build a discrimination model and extract lists of genes specific to each disease class. Here we focus on drugs that can be repurposed for dementia treatment as an outcome of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we determined dementia-associated genes statistically highly ranked in other disease classes. Additionally, we report a mechanism for detecting genes common to multiple health conditions. These sets of genes were classified based on their presence in biological pathways, aiding in selecting candidates and biological processes that are exploitable with drug repurposing.",2024,,,"Sikirzhytskaya, A; Tyagin, I; Sutton, SS; Wyatt, MD; Safro, I; Shtutman, M"
LCADNet: a novel light CNN architecture for EEG-based Alzheimer disease detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and incurable neurologi-cal disorder with a rising mortality rate, worsened by error-prone, time-intensive, and expensive clinical diagnosis methods. Automatic AD detection methods using hand-crafted Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal features lack accuracy and reliability. A lightweight convolution neural network for AD detection (LCADNet) is investigated to extract disease-specific features while reducing the detection time. The LCADNet uses two convolutional layers for extracting complex EEG features, two fully connected layers for selecting disease-specific features, and a softmax layer for predicting AD detection probability. A max-pooling layer interlaced between convolutional layers decreases the time-domain redundancy in the EEG signal. The efficiency of the LCADNet and four pre-trained models using transfer learning is compared using a publicly available AD detection dataset. The LCADNet shows the lowest computation complexity in terms of both the number of floating point operations and inference time and the highest classification performance across six measures. The generalization of the LCADNet is assessed by cross-testing it with two other publicly available AD detection datasets. It outperforms existing EEG-based AD detection methods with an accuracy of 98.50%.

Automated free speech analysis reveals distinct markers of Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.,"Dementia can disrupt how people experience and describe events as well as their own role in them. Alzheimer's disease (AD) compromises the processing of entities expressed by nouns, while behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) entails a depersonalized perspective with increased third-person references. Yet, no study has examined whether these patterns can be captured in connected speech via natural language processing tools. To tackle such gaps, we asked 96 participants (32 AD patients, 32 bvFTD patients, 32 healthy controls) to narrate a typical day of their lives and calculated the proportion of nouns, verbs, and first- or third-person markers (via part-of-speech and morphological tagging). We also extracted objective properties (frequency, phonological neighborhood, length, semantic variability) from each content word. In our main study (with 21 AD patients, 21 bvFTD patients, and 21 healthy controls), we used inferential statistics and machine learning for group-level and subject-level discrimination. The above linguistic features were correlated with patients' scores in tests of general cognitive status and executive functions. We found that, compared with HCs, (i) AD (but not bvFTD) patients produced significantly fewer nouns, (ii) bvFTD (but not AD) patients used significantly more third-person markers, and (iii) both patient groups produced more frequent words. Machine learning analyses showed that these features identified individuals with AD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.71). A generalizability test, with a model trained on the entire main study sample and tested on hold-out samples (11 AD patients, 11 bvFTD patients, 11 healthy controls), showed even better performance, with AUCs of 0.76 and 0.83 for AD and bvFTD, respectively. No linguistic feature was significantly correlated with cognitive test scores in either patient group. These results suggest that specific cognitive traits of each disorder can be captured automatically in connected speech, favoring interpretability for enhanced syndrome characterization, diagnosis, and monitoring.",2024,,Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; Speech; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Biomarkers; Natural Language Processing; Machine Learning; Neuropsychological Tests; Executive Function,"Lopes da Cunha, P; Ruiz, F; Ferrante, F; Sterpin, LF; Ibáñez, A; Slachevsky, A; Matallana, D; Martínez, Á; Hesse, E; García, AM"

Fine hippocampal morphology analysis with a multi-dataset cross-sectional study on 2911 subjects.,"CA1 subfield and subiculum of the hippocampus contain a series of dentate bulges, which are also called hippocampus dentation (HD). There have been several studies demonstrating an association between HD and brain disorders. Such as the number of hippocampal dentation correlates with temporal lobe epilepsy. And epileptic hippocampus have a lower number of dentation compared to contralateral hippocampus. However, most studies rely on subjective assessment by manual searching and counting in HD areas, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to process large amounts of samples. And to date, only one objective method for quantifying HD has been proposed. Therefore, to fill this gap, we developed an automated and objective method to quantify HD and explore its relationship with neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we performed a fine-scale morphological characterization of HD in 2911 subjects from four different cohorts of ADNI, PPMI, HCP, and IXI to quantify and explore differences between them in MR T1w images. The results showed that the degree of right hippocampal dentation are lower in patients with Alzheimer's disease than samples in mild cognitive impairment or cognitively normal, whereas this change is not significant in Parkinson's disease progression. The innovation of this paper that we propose a quantitative, robust, and fully automated method. These methodological innovation and corresponding results delineated above constitute the significance and novelty of our study. What's more, the proposed method breaks through the limitations of manual labeling and is the first to quantitatively measure and compare HD in four different brain populations including thousands of subjects. These findings revealed new morphological patterns in the hippocampal dentation, which can help with subsequent fine-scale hippocampal morphology research.",2024,Automatic quantification; Hippocampal dentation; Hippocampus; Morphology; Neurodegenerative disease,,"Yang, Q; Chen, G; Yang, Z; Raviv, TR; Gao, Y"
A multimodal machine learning model for predicting dementia conversion in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60-70% of the population with dementia. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a diagnostic entity defined as an intermediate stage between subjective cognitive decline and dementia, and about 10-15% of people annually convert to AD. We aimed to investigate the most robust model and modality combination by combining multi-modality image features based on demographic characteristics in six machine learning models. A total of 196 subjects were enrolled from four hospitals and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. During the four-year follow-up period, 47 (24%) patients progressed from MCI to AD. Volumes of the regions of interest, white matter hyperintensity, and regional Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) were analyzed using T1, T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRIs, and amyloid PET (αPET), along with automatically provided hippocampal occupancy scores (HOC) and Fazekas scales. As a result of testing the robustness of the model, the GBM model was the most stable, and in modality combination, model performance was further improved in the absence of T2-FLAIR image features. Our study predicts the probability of AD conversion in MCI patients, which is expected to be useful information for clinician's early diagnosis and treatment plan design.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Machine Learning; Female; Male; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Disease Progression; Positron-Emission Tomography; Aged, 80 and over; Neuroimaging; Dementia","Lee, MW; Kim, HW; Choe, YS; Yang, HS; Lee, J; Lee, H; Yong, JH; Kim, D; Lee, M; Kang, DW; Jeon, SY; Son, SJ; Lee, YM; Kim, HG; Kim, REY; Lim, HK"

CCADD: An online webserver for Alzheimer's disease detection from brain MRI.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) imposes a growing burden on public health due to its impact on memory, cognition, behavior, and social skills. Early detection using non-invasive brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) is vital for disease management. We introduce CCADD (Corpus Callosum-based Alzheimer's Disease Detection), a user-friendly webserver that automatically identifies and segments the corpus callosum (CC) region from brain MRI slices. Extracted shape and size-based features of CC are fed into Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers to predict AD or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Exhaustive benchmarking on ADNI data reveals high prediction accuracies for different AD severity levels. CCADD empowers clinicians and researchers for AD detection.

Consensus Paper: Cerebellum and Reward.,"Cerebellum is a key-structure for the modulation of motor, cognitive, social and affective functions, contributing to automatic behaviours through interactions with the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and spinal cord. The predictive mechanisms used by the cerebellum cover not only sensorimotor functions but also reward-related tasks. Cerebellar circuits appear to encode temporal difference error and reward prediction error. From a chemical standpoint, cerebellar catecholamines modulate the rate of cerebellar-based cognitive learning, and mediate cerebellar contributions during complex behaviours. Reward processing and its associated emotions are tuned by the cerebellum which operates as a controller of adaptive homeostatic processes based on interoceptive and exteroceptive inputs. Lobules VI-VII/areas of the vermis are candidate regions for the cortico-subcortical signaling pathways associated with loss aversion and reward sensitivity, together with other nodes of the limbic circuitry. There is growing evidence that the cerebellum works as a hub of regional dysconnectivity across all mood states and that mental disorders involve the cerebellar circuitry, including mood and addiction disorders, and impaired eating behaviors where the cerebellum might be involved in longer time scales of prediction as compared to motor operations. Cerebellar patients exhibit aberrant social behaviour, showing aberrant impulsivity/compulsivity. The cerebellum is a master-piece of reward mechanisms, together with the striatum, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Critically, studies on reward processing reinforce our view that a fundamental role of the cerebellum is to construct internal models, perform predictions on the impact of future behaviour and compare what is predicted and what actually occurs.",2024,Addiction; Ataxias; Catecholamines; Cerebellum; Emotions; Mood; Predictions; Reward; Social interactions,,"Manto, M; Adamaszek, M; Apps, R; Carlson, E; Guarque-Chabrera, J; Heleven, E; Kakei, S; Khodakhah, K; Kuo, SH; Lin, CR; Joshua, M; Miquel, M; Mitoma, H; Larry, N; Péron, JA; Pickford, J; Schutter, DJLG; Singh, MK; Tan, T; Tanaka, H; Tsai, P; Van Overwalle, F; Yamashiro, K"

Switching off: disruptive TMS reveals distinct contributions of the posterior middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus to bilingual speech production.,"The role of the left temporoparietal cortex in speech production has been extensively studied during native language processing, proving crucial in controlled lexico-semantic retrieval under varying cognitive demands. Yet, its role in bilinguals, fluent in both native and second languages, remains poorly understood. Here, we employed continuous theta burst stimulation to disrupt neural activity in the left posterior middle-temporal gyrus (pMTG) and angular gyrus (AG) while Italian-Friulian bilinguals performed a cued picture-naming task. The task involved between-language (naming objects in Italian or Friulian) and within-language blocks (naming objects [""knife""] or associated actions [""cut""] in a single language) in which participants could either maintain (non-switch) or change (switch) instructions based on cues. During within-language blocks, cTBS over the pMTG entailed faster naming for high-demanding switch trials, while cTBS to the AG elicited slower latencies in low-demanding non-switch trials. No cTBS effects were observed in the between-language block. Our findings suggest a causal involvement of the left pMTG and AG in lexico-semantic processing across languages, with distinct contributions to controlled vs. ""automatic"" retrieval, respectively. However, they do not support the existence of shared control mechanisms within and between language(s) production. Altogether, these results inform neurobiological models of semantic control in bilinguals.",2024,angular gyrus; bilingualism; continuous theta burst stimulation; posterior middle temporal gyrus; speech production,Humans; Multilingualism; Male; Temporal Lobe; Female; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Young Adult; Adult; Parietal Lobe; Speech; Cues,"Timofeeva, P; Finisguerra, A; D'Argenio, G; García, AM; Carreiras, M; Quiñones, I; Urgesi, C; Amoruso, L"

Prediction of Alzheimer's disease stages based on ResNet-Self-attention architecture with Bayesian optimization and best features selection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative illness that impairs cognition, function, and behavior by causing irreversible damage to multiple brain areas, including the hippocampus. The suffering of the patients and their family members will be lessened with an early diagnosis of AD. The automatic diagnosis technique is widely required due to the shortage of medical experts and eases the burden of medical staff. The automatic artificial intelligence (AI)-based computerized method can help experts achieve better diagnosis accuracy and precision rates. This study proposes a new automated framework for AD stage prediction based on the ResNet-Self architecture and Fuzzy Entropy-controlled Path-Finding Algorithm (FEcPFA). A data augmentation technique has been utilized to resolve the dataset imbalance issue. In the next step, we proposed a new deep-learning model based on the self-attention module. A ResNet-50 architecture is modified and connected with a self-attention block for important information extraction. The hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO) and then utilized to train the model, which was subsequently employed for feature extraction. The self-attention extracted features were optimized using the proposed FEcPFA. The best features were selected using FEcPFA and passed to the machine learning classifiers for the final classification. The experimental process utilized a publicly available MRI dataset and achieved an improved accuracy of 99.9%. The results were compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, demonstrating the improvement of the proposed framework in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; MRI; convolutional neural network; deep learning; fuzzy entropy; optimization; self-attention,,"Yaqoob, N; Khan, MA; Masood, S; Albarakati, HM; Hamza, A; Alhayan, F; Jamel, L; Masood, A"

Cost-Sensitive Weighted Contrastive Learning Based on Graph Convolutional Networks for Imbalanced Alzheimer's Disease Staging.,"Identifying the progression stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be considered as an imbalanced multi-class classification problem in machine learning. It is challenging due to the class imbalance issue and the heterogeneity of the disease. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been successfully applied in AD classification. However, these works did not handle the class imbalance issue in classification. Besides, they ignore the heterogeneity of the disease. To this end, we propose a novel cost-sensitive weighted contrastive learning method based on graph convolutional networks (CSWCL-GCNs) for imbalanced AD staging using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The proposed method is developed on a multi-view graph constructed using the functional connectivity (FC) and high-order functional connectivity (HOFC) features of the subjects. A novel cost-sensitive weighted contrastive learning procedure is proposed to capture discriminative information from the minority classes, encouraging the samples in the minority class to provide adequate supervision. Considering the heterogeneity of the disease, the weights of the negative pairs are introduced into contrastive learning and they are computed based on the distance to class prototypes, which are automatically learned from the training data. Meanwhile, the cost-sensitive mechanism is further introduced into contrastive learning to handle the class imbalance issue. The proposed CSWCL-GCN is evaluated on 720 subjects (including 184 NCs, 40 SMC patients, 208 EMCI patients, 172 LMCI patients and 116 AD patients) from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative).

The Optimization of a Natural Language Processing Approach for the Automatic Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using GPT Embeddings.,"The development of noninvasive and cost-effective methods of detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for its early prevention and mitigation. We optimize the detection of AD using natural language processing (NLP) of spontaneous speech through the use of audio enhancement techniques and novel transcription methodologies. Specifically, we utilized Boll Spectral Subtraction to improve audio fidelity and created transcriptions using state-of-the-art AI services-locally-based Wav2Vec and Whisper, alongside cloud-based IBM Cloud and Rev AI-evaluating their performance against traditional manual transcription methods. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were then trained and tested using GPT-based embeddings of transcriptions. Our findings revealed that AI-based transcriptions largely outperformed traditional manual ones, with Wav2Vec (enhanced audio) achieving the best accuracy and F-1 score (0.99 for both metrics) for locally-based systems and Rev AI (standard audio) performing the best for cloud-based systems (0.96 for both metrics). Furthermore, this study revealed the detrimental effects of interviewer speech on model performance in addition to the minimal effect of audio enhancement. Based on our findings, current AI transcription and NLP technologies are highly effective at accurately detecting AD with available data but struggle to classify probable AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, due to a lack of training data, laying the groundwork for the future implementation of an automatic AD detection system.",2024,GPT; NLP; dementia; embeddings,,"Runde, BS; Alapati, A; Bazan, NG"

Dynamically stabilized recurrent neural network optimized with Artificial Gorilla Troops espoused Alzheimer's disorder detection using EEG signals.,"Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurological disorder that damages cognitive abilities, but early identification reduces the symptoms significantly. The absence of competent healthcare professionals has made automatic identification of Alzheimer's disease more crucial since it lessens the amount of work for staff members and improves diagnostic outcomes. The major aim of this work is ""to develop a computer diagnostic scheme that makes it possible to identify AD using the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal"". Therefore, Dynamically Stabilized Recurrent Neural Network Optimized with Artificial Gorilla Troops espoused Alzheimer's Disorder Detection using EEG signals (DSRNN-AGTO-ADD) is proposed in this paper. Here, Dynamic Context-Sensitive Filter (DCSF) is considered to eliminate the noise, and interference from the EEG signal. Then Adaptive and Concise Empirical Wavelet Transform (ACEWT) is utilized to separate the filtered signals from the frequency bands, and to feature extraction from the EEG signals. Signal's characteristics, like logarithmic bandwidth power, standard deviation, variance, kurtosis, mean energy, mean square, norm are combined to ACEWT method to create feature vectors and enhance diagnostic performance. After that, the extracted features are fed to Dynamically Stabilized Recurrent Neural Network (DSRNN) for task classification. Weight parameter of DSRNN is enhanced using Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimization Algorithm (AGTOA). The proposed DSRNN-AGTOA-ADD algorithm is activated in MATLAB. The metrics including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, computation time, ROC are examined for AD diagnosis. The performance of the proposed DSRNN-AGTOA-ADD approach attains 12.98%, 5.98% and 23.45% high specificity; 29.98%, 23.32% and 19.76% lower computation Time and 29.29%, 8.365%, 8.551% and 7.915% higher ROC compared with the existing methods.",2024,Adaptive and concise empirical wavelet transform; Artificial Gorilla Troops optimization algorithm; Dynamic context-sensitive filter; Dynamically stabilized recurrent neural network; EEG signal,,"Sudha, G; Saravanan, N; Muthalakshmi, M; Birunda, M"
Cognitive Exercise for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Using a Social Robot.,"Reminiscence therapy (RT) can improve the mood and communication of persons living with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease related dementias (PLWD). Traditional RT requires professionals' facilitation, limiting its accessibility to PLWD. Social robotics has the potential to facilitate RT, enabling accessible, home-based RT. However, studies are needed to investigate how PLWD would perceive a robot-mediated RT (RMRT) and how to develop RMRT for positive user experience and successful adoption. In this paper, we developed a prototype of RMRT using a humanoid social robot and tested it with 12 participants (7 PLWD, 2 with mild cognitive impairment, and 3 informal caregivers). The robot automatically displayed a memory trigger on its tablet and engaged participants in a relatable conversation during RMRT. A mixed-method approach was employed to assess its acceptability and usability. Our results showed that PLWD had an overall positive user experience with the RMRT. Participants laughed and sang along with the robot during RMRT and demonstrated intention to use it. We additionally discussed robot control method and several critical problems for RMRT. The RMRT can facilitate both verbal and nonverbal social interaction for PLWD and holds promise for engaging, personalized, and efficient home-based cognitive exercises for PLWD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Social robots; cognitive exercise; dementia care; reminiscence therapy,,"Yuan, F; Boltz, M; Bilal, D; Jao, YL; Crane, M; Duzan, J; Bahour, A; Zhao, X"

Utilizing graph convolutional networks for identification of mild cognitive impairment from single modal fMRI data: a multiconnection pattern combination approach.,"Mild cognitive impairment plays a crucial role in predicting the early progression of Alzheimer's disease, and it can be used as an important indicator of the disease progression. Currently, numerous studies have focused on utilizing the functional brain network as a novel biomarker for mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. In this context, we employed a graph convolutional neural network to automatically extract functional brain network features, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction, to improve the mild cognitive impairment diagnosis performance. However, previous graph convolutional neural network approaches have primarily concentrated on single modes of brain connectivity, leading to a failure to leverage the potential complementary information offered by diverse connectivity patterns and limiting their efficacy. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel method called the graph convolutional neural network with multimodel connectivity, which integrates multimode connectivity for the identification of mild cognitive impairment using fMRI data and evaluates the graph convolutional neural network with multimodel connectivity approach through a mild cognitive impairment diagnostic task on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.

MAD-Former: A Traceable Interpretability Model for Alzheimer's Disease Recognition Based on Multi-Patch Attention.,"The integration of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning techniques is one of the important research directions for the automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the satisfactory performance achieved by existing voxel-based models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such models only handle AD-related brain atrophy at a single spatial scale and lack spatial localization of abnormal brain regions based on model interpretability. To address the above limitations, we propose a traceable interpretability model for AD recognition based on multi-patch attention (MAD-Former). MAD-Former consists of two parts: recognition and interpretability. In the recognition part, we design a 3D brain feature extraction network to extract local features, followed by constructing a dual-branch attention structure with different patch sizes to achieve global feature extraction, forming a multi-scale spatial feature extraction framework. Meanwhile, we propose an important attention similarity position loss function to assist in model decision-making. The interpretability part proposes a traceable method that can obtain a 3D ROI space through attention-based selection and receptive field tracing. This space encompasses key brain tissues that influence model decisions. Experimental results reveal the significant role of brain tissues such as the Fusiform Gyrus (FuG) in AD recognition. MAD-Former achieves outstanding performance in different tasks on ADNI and OASIS datasets, demonstrating reliable model interpretability.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Deep Learning; Algorithms; Aged","Ye, J; Zeng, A; Pan, D; Zhang, Y; Zhao, J; Chen, Q; Liu, Y"

Here, we propose a tensor decomposition-based scheme for automatically diagnosing MCI using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. A new projection is proposed, which preserves the spatial information of the electrodes to construct a data tensor. Then, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition, the features are extracted, and a support vector machine (SVM) is used to discriminate MCI from normal subjects. The proposed scheme was tested on two different datasets. The results showed that the tensor-based method outperformed conventional methods in diagnosing MCI with an average classification accuracy of 93.96% and 78.65% for the first and second datasets, respectively. Therefore, it seems that maintaining the spatial topology of the signals plays a vital role in the processing of EEG signals.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC); Tensor decomposition,,"Faghfouri, A; Shalchyan, V; Toor, HG; Amjad, I; Niazi, IK"

Feasibility of Identifying Factors Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia in Real-World Data.,"A comprehensive view of factors associated with AD/ADRD will significantly aid in studies to develop new treatments for AD/ADRD and identify high-risk populations and patients for prevention efforts. In our study, we summarized the risk factors for AD/ADRD by reviewing existing meta-analyses and review articles on risk and preventive factors for AD/ADRD. In total, we extracted 477 risk factors in 10 categories from 537 studies. We constructed an interactive knowledge map to disseminate our study results. Most of the risk factors are accessible from structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and clinical narratives show promise as information sources. However, evaluating genomic risk factors using RWD remains a challenge, as genetic testing for AD/ADRD is still not a common practice and is poorly documented in both structured and unstructured EHRs. Considering the constantly evolving research on AD/ADRD risk factors, literature mining via NLP methods offers a solution to automatically update our knowledge map.",2024,Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia; Natural Language Processing,,"Chen, A; Li, Q; Huang, Y; Li, Y; Chuang, YN; Hu, X; Guo, S; Wu, Y; Guo, Y; Bian, J"
Monitoring Disease Severity of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Single-Channel EEG Data Using Regression Analysis.,"A deviation in the soundness of cognitive health is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and it is important to monitor it early to prevent complicated diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Traditionally, MCI severity is monitored with manual scoring using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In this study, we propose a new MCI severity monitoring algorithm with regression analysis of extracted features of single-channel electro-encephalography (EEG) data by automatically generating severity scores equivalent to MoCA scores. We evaluated both multi-trial and single-trail analysis for the algorithm development. For multi-trial analysis, 590 features were extracted from the prominent event-related potential (ERP) points and corresponding time domain characteristics, and we utilized the lasso regression technique to select the best feature set. The 13 best features were used in the classical regression techniques: multivariate regression (MR), ensemble regression (ER), support vector regression (SVR), and ridge regression (RR). The best results were observed for ER with an RMSE of 1.6 and residual analysis. In single-trial analysis, we extracted a time-frequency plot image from each trial and fed it as an input to the constructed convolutional deep neural network (CNN). This deep CNN model resulted an RMSE of 2.76. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate automated scores for MCI severity equivalent to MoCA from single-channel EEG data with multi-trial and single data.",2024,Montreal cognitive assessment; deep learning; electroencephalography; ensemble regression; event-related potential; mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Regression Analysis; Electroencephalography; Patient Acuity,"Khatun, S; Morshed, BI; Bidelman, GM"
Classification Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia Using Physiological Data and ECD SPECT Images.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two most common forms of dementia. However, their neuropsychological and pathological features often overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between AD and VaD. In addition to clinical consultation and laboratory examinations, clinical dementia diagnosis in Taiwan will also include Tc-99m-ECD SPECT imaging examination. Through machine learning and deep learning technology, we explored the feasibility of using the above clinical practice data to distinguish AD and VaD. We used the physiological data (33 features) and Tc-99m-ECD SPECT images of 112 AD patients and 85 VaD patients in the Taiwanese Nuclear Medicine Brain Image Database to train the classification model. The results, after filtering by the number of SVM RFE 5-fold features, show that the average accuracy of physiological data in distinguishing AD/VaD is 81.22% and the AUC is 0.836; the average accuracy of training images using the Inception V3 model is 85% and the AUC is 0.95. Finally, Grad-CAM heatmap was used to visualize the areas of concern of the model and compared with the SPM analysis method to further understand the differences. This research method can quickly use machine learning and deep learning models to automatically extract image features based on a small amount of general clinical data to objectively distinguish AD and VaD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; ECD SPECT images; classification prediction; vascular dementia,,"Ni, YC; Lin, ZK; Cheng, CH; Pai, MC; Chiu, PY; Chang, CC; Chang, YT; Hung, GU; Lin, KJ; Hsiao, IT; Lin, CY; Yang, HC"

Surface-functionalized SERS platform for deep learning-assisted diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to stall the deterioration of brain function, but conventional diagnostic methods require complicated analytical procedures or inflict acute pain on the patient. Then, label-free Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis of blood-based biomarkers is a convenient alternative to rapidly obtain spectral information from biofluids. However, despite the rapid acquisition of spectral information from biofluids, it is challenging to distinguish spectral features of biomarkers due to interference from biofluidic components. Here, we introduce a deep learning-assisted, SERS-based platform for separate analysis of blood-based amyloid β (1-42) and metabolites, enabling the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. SERS substrates consisting of Au nanowire arrays are fabricated and functionalized in two characteristic ways to compare the validity of different Alzheimer's disease biomarkers measured on our SERS system. The 6E10 antibody is immobilized for the capture of amyloid β (1-42) and analysis of its oligomerization process, while various self-assembled monolayers are attached for different dipole interactions with blood-based metabolites. Ultimately, SERS spectra of blood plasma of Alzheimer's disease patients and human controls are measured on the substrates and classified via advanced deep learning techniques that automatically extract informative features to learn generalizable representations. Accuracies up to 99.5% are achieved for metabolite-based analyses, which are verified with an explainable artificial intelligence technique that identifies key spectral features used for classification and for deducing significant biomarkers.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Blood-based biomarker; Deep learning; Gold nanowire array; Label-free diagnosis; Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Biosensing Techniques; Metal Nanoparticles; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Biomarkers","Kim, M; Huh, S; Park, HJ; Cho, SH; Lee, MY; Jo, S; Jung, YS"
The impact of Bayesian optimization on feature selection.,"Feature selection is an indispensable step for the analysis of high-dimensional molecular data. Despite its importance, consensus is lacking on how to choose the most appropriate feature selection methods, especially when the performance of the feature selection methods itself depends on hyper-parameters. Bayesian optimization has demonstrated its advantages in automatically configuring the settings of hyper-parameters for various models. However, it remains unclear whether Bayesian optimization can benefit feature selection methods. In this research, we conducted extensive simulation studies to compare the performance of various feature selection methods, with a particular focus on the impact of Bayesian optimization on those where hyper-parameters tuning is needed. We further utilized the gene expression data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to predict various brain imaging-related phenotypes, where various feature selection methods were employed to mine the data. We found through simulation studies that feature selection methods with hyper-parameters tuned using Bayesian optimization often yield better recall rates, and the analysis of transcriptomic data further revealed that Bayesian optimization-guided feature selection can improve the accuracy of disease risk prediction models. In conclusion, Bayesian optimization can facilitate feature selection methods when hyper-parameter tuning is needed and has the potential to substantially benefit downstream tasks.",2024,,Bayes Theorem; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Neuroimaging,"Yang, K; Liu, L; Wen, Y"
Atypical cortical hierarchy in Aβ-positive older adults and its reflection in spontaneous speech.,"Abnormal deposition of Aβ amyloid is an early neuropathological marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), arising long ahead of clinical symptoms. Non-invasive measures of associated early neurofunctional changes, together with easily accessible behavioral readouts of these changes, could be of great clinical benefit. We pursued this aim by investigating large-scale cortical gradients of functional connectivity with functional MRI, which capture the hierarchical integration of cortical functions, together with acoustic-prosodic features from spontaneous speech, in cognitively unimpaired older adults with and without Aβ positivity (total N = 188). We predicted distortions of the cortical hierarchy associated with prosodic changes in the Aβ + group. Results confirmed substantially altered cortical hierarchies and less variability in these in the Aβ + group, together with an increase in quantitative prosodic measures, which correlated with gradient variability as well as digit span test scores. Overall, these findings confirm that long before the clinical stage and objective cognitive impairment, increased risk of cognitive decline as indexed by Aβ accumulation is marked by neurofunctional changes in the cortical hierarchy, which are related to automatically extractable speech patterns and alterations in working memory functions.",2024,Aβ amyloid; Cognitive decline; Cortical gradient; Dementia; Functional connectivity,Humans; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Speech; Positron-Emission Tomography; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction,"He, R; Al-Tamimi, J; Sánchez-Benavides, G; Montaña-Valverde, G; Domingo Gispert, J; Grau-Rivera, O; Suárez-Calvet, M; Minguillon, C; Fauria, K; Navarro, A; Hinzen, W"

An Alzheimer's Disease classification network based on MRI utilizing diffusion maps for multi-scale feature fusion in graph convolution.,"Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been widely utilized in Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification research due to its ability to automatically learn robust and powerful feature representations. Inter-patient relationships are effectively captured by constructing patients magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data as graph data, where nodes represent individuals and edges denote the relationships between them. However, the performance of GCNs might be constrained by the construction of the graph adjacency matrix, thereby leading to learned features potentially overlooking intrinsic correlations among patients, which ultimately causes inaccurate disease classifications. To address this issue, we propose an Alzheimer's disease Classification network based on MRI utilizing diffusion maps for multi-scale feature fusion in graph convolution. This method aims to tackle the problem of features neglecting intrinsic relationships among patients while integrating features from diffusion mapping with different neighbor counts to better represent patients and achieve an accurate AD classification. Initially, the diffusion maps method conducts diffusion information in the feature space, thus breaking free from the constraints of diffusion based on the adjacency matrix. Subsequently, the diffusion features with different neighbor counts are merged, and a self-attention mechanism is employed to adaptively adjust the weights of diffusion features at different scales, thereby comprehensively and accurately capturing patient characteristics. Finally, metric learning techniques enhance the similarity of node features within the same category in the graph structure and bring node features of different categories more distant from each other. This study aims to enhance the classification accuracy of AD, by providing an effective tool for early diagnosis and intervention. It offers valuable information for clinical decisions and personalized treatment. Experimentation on the publicly accessible Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset validated our method's competitive performance across various AD-related classification tasks. Compared to existing methodologies, our approach captures patient characteristics more effectively and demonstrates superior generalization capabilities.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; deep learning; diffusion maps; graph convolutional network; metric learning,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Machine Learning; Learning,"Yang, Z; Li, K; Gan, H; Huang, Z; Shi, M; Zhou, R"
Early inner plexiform layer thinning and retinal nerve fiber layer thickening in excitotoxic retinal injury using deep learning-assisted optical coherence tomography.,"Excitotoxicity from the impairment of glutamate uptake constitutes an important mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Within the eye, excitotoxicity is thought to play a critical role in retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinal ischemia, and optic nerve injury, yet how excitotoxic injury impacts different retinal layers is not well understood. Here, we investigated the longitudinal effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic retinal injury in a rat model using deep learning-assisted retinal layer thickness estimation. Before and after unilateral intravitreal NMDA injection in nine adult Long Evans rats, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to acquire volumetric retinal images in both eyes over 4 weeks. Ten retinal layers were automatically segmented from the OCT data using our deep learning-based algorithm. Retinal degeneration was evaluated using layer-specific retinal thickness changes at each time point (before, and at 3, 7, and 28 days after NMDA injection). Within the inner retina, our OCT results showed that retinal thinning occurred first in the inner plexiform layer at 3 days after NMDA injection, followed by the inner nuclear layer at 7 days post-injury. In contrast, the retinal nerve fiber layer exhibited an initial thickening 3 days after NMDA injection, followed by normalization and thinning up to 4 weeks post-injury. Our results demonstrated the pathological cascades of NMDA-induced neurotoxicity across different layers of the retina. The early inner plexiform layer thinning suggests early dendritic shrinkage, whereas the initial retinal nerve fiber layer thickening before subsequent normalization and thinning indicates early inflammation before axonal loss and cell death. These findings implicate the inner plexiform layer as an early imaging biomarker of excitotoxic retinal degeneration, whereas caution is warranted when interpreting the ganglion cell complex combining retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, and inner plexiform layer thicknesses in conventional OCT measures. Deep learning-assisted retinal layer segmentation and longitudinal OCT monitoring can help evaluate the different phases of retinal layer damage upon excitotoxicity.",2024,Deep learning; Excitotoxicity; N-methyl-D-aspartate; Optical coherence tomography; Retinal thickness; Transfer learning,"Rats; Animals; Retinal Degeneration; Tomography, Optical Coherence; N-Methylaspartate; Deep Learning; Rats, Long-Evans; Retina; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Nerve Fibers","Ma, D; Deng, W; Khera, Z; Sajitha, TA; Wang, X; Wollstein, G; Schuman, JS; Lee, S; Shi, H; Ju, MJ; Matsubara, J; Beg, MF; Sarunic, M; Sappington, RM; Chan, KC"

The Optimization of a Natural Language Processing Approach for the Automatic Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using GPT Embeddings.,"As the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is projected to grow in the coming decades as the world's population ages, the development of noninvasive and cost-effective methods of detecting AD is essential for the early prevention and mitigation of the progressive disease, alleviating its expected global impact. This study analyzes audio processing techniques and transcription methodologies to optimize the detection of AD through the natural language processing (NLP) of spontaneous speech. We enhanced audio fidelity using Boll Spectral Subtraction and evaluated the transcription accuracy of state-of-the-art AI services-locally-based Wav2Vec and Whisper, alongside cloud-based IBM Cloud and Rev AI-against traditional manual transcription methods. The choice between local and cloud-based solutions hinges on a trade-off between privacy, ongoing costs, and computational requirements. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT for word embeddings, we enhanced the training of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, which were crucial in analyzing transcripts and refining detection accuracy. Our findings reveal that AI-driven transcriptions significantly outperform manual counterparts when classifying AD and Control samples, with Wav2Vec using enhanced audio exhibiting the highest accuracy and F-1 scores (0.99 for both metrics) for locally based systems and Rev AI using unenhanced audio leading cloud-based methods with comparable precision (0.96 for both metrics). The study also uncovers the detrimental effect of including interviewer speech in recordings on model performance, advocating for the exclusion of such interactions to improve data quality for AD classification algorithms. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that AI transcription (both Cloud and Local) and NLP technologies in their current forms can classify AD, as well as probable AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, accurately but suffer from a lack of available training data. The insights garnered from this research lay the groundwork for future advancements in the noninvasive monitoring and early detection of cognitive impairments through linguistic analysis.",2024,,,"Runde, BS; Alapati, A; Bazan, NG"

Integrated partially linear model for multi-center studies with heterogeneity and batch effect in covariates.,"The design of multi-center study is increasingly used for borrowing strength from multiple research groups to obtain broadly applicable and reproducible study findings. Regression analysis is widely used for analyzing multi-group studies, however, some of the large number of regression predictors are nonlinear and/or often measured with batch effects in many large scale collaborative studies. Also, the group compositions of the nonlinear predictors are potentially heterogeneous across different centers. The conventional pooled data analysis ignores the interplay between nonlinearity and batch effect, group composition heterogeneity, measurement error and other data incoherence in multi-center setting that can cause biased regression estimates and misleading outcomes. In this paper, we propose an integrated partially linear regression model (IPLM) based analysis to account for the predictor's nonlinearity, general batch effect, group composition heterogeneity, high-dimensional covariates, potential measurement-error in covariates, and combinations of these complexities simultaneously. A local linear regression based approach is employed to estimate the nonlinear component and a regularization procedure is introduced to identify the predictors' effects that can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous across groups. In particular, when the effects of all predictors are homogeneous across the study centers, the proposed IPLM can automatically reduce to one single parsimonious partially linear model for all centers. The proposed method has asymptotic estimation and variable selection consistency including high-dimensional covariates. Moreover, it has a fast computing algorithm and its effectiveness is supported by numerical simulation studies. A multi-center Alzheimer's disease research project is provided to illustrate the proposed IPLM based analysis.",2023,Multi-center study; data harmonization; general batch effects; group composition heterogeneity; partially linear regression model,,"Yang, L; Shao, Y"
Named Entity Recognition and Normalization for Alzheimer's Disease Eligibility Criteria.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Finding effective treatments for this disease is crucial. Clinical trials play an essential role in developing and testing new treatments for AD. However, identifying eligible participants can be challenging, time-consuming, and costly. In recent years, the development of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically named entity recognition (NER) and named entity normalization (NEN), have helped to automate the identification and extraction of relevant information from the eligibility criteria (EC) more efficiently, in order to facilitate semi-automatic patient recruitment and enable data FAIRness for clinical trial data. Nevertheless, most current biomedical NER models only provide annotations for a restricted set of entity types that may not be applicable to the clinical trial data. Additionally, accurately performing NEN on entities that are negated using a negative prefix currently lacks established techniques. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline designed for information extraction from AD clinical trial EC, which involves preprocessing of the EC data, clinical NER, and biomedical NEN to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our NER model can identify named entities in seven pre-defined categories, while our NEN model employs a combination of exact match and partial match search strategies, as well as customized rules to accurately normalize entities with negative prefixes. To evaluate the performance of our pipeline, we measured the precision, recall, and F1 score for the NER component, and we manually reviewed the top five mapping results produced by the NEN component. Our evaluation of the pipeline's performance revealed that it can successfully normalize named entities in clinical trial ECs with optimal accuracies. The NER component achieved a overall F1 of 0.816, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify seven types of named entities in clinical text. The NEN component of the pipeline also demonstrated impressive performance, with customized rules and a combination of exact and partial match strategies leading to an accuracy of 0.940 for normalized entities.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; clinical trial eligibility criteria; named entity normalization; named entity recognition,,"Sun, Z; Tao, C"

Enhancing foveal avascular zone analysis for Alzheimer's diagnosis with AI segmentation and machine learning using multiple radiomic features.,"We propose a hybrid technique that employs artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation and machine learning classification using multiple features extracted from the foveal avascular zone (FAZ)-a retinal biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-to improve the disease diagnostic performance. Imaging data of optical coherence tomography angiography from 37 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 48 healthy controls were investigated. The presence or absence of brain amyloids was confirmed using amyloid positron emission tomography. In the superficial capillary plexus of the angiography scans, the FAZ was automatically segmented using an AI method to extract multiple biomarkers (area, solidity, compactness, roundness, and eccentricity), which were paired with clinical data (age and sex) as common correction variables. We used a light-gradient boosting machine (a light-gradient boosting machine is a machine learning algorithm based on trees utilizing gradient boosting) to diagnose Alzheimer's disease by integrating the corresponding multiple radiomic biomarkers. Fivefold cross-validation was applied for analysis, and the diagnostic performance for Alzheimer's disease was determined by the area under the curve. The proposed hybrid technique achieved an area under the curve of [Formula: see text]%, outperforming the existing single-feature (area) criteria by over 13%. Furthermore, in the holdout test set, the proposed technique exhibited a 14% improvement compared to single features, achieving an area under the curve of 72.0± 4.8%.

"A framework for language technologies in behavioral research and clinical applications: Ethical challenges, implications, and solutions.","Technological advances in the assessment and understanding of speech and language within the domains of automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning present a remarkable opportunity for psychologists to learn more about human thought and communication, evaluate a variety of clinical conditions, and predict cognitive and psychological states. These innovations can be leveraged to automate traditionally time-intensive assessment tasks (e.g., educational assessment), provide psychological information and care (e.g., chatbots), and when delivered remotely (e.g., by mobile phone or wearable sensors) promise underserved communities greater access to health care. Indeed, the automatic analysis of speech provides a wealth of information that can be used for patient care in a wide range of settings (e.g., mHealth applications) and for diverse purposes (e.g., behavioral and clinical research, medical tools that are implemented into practice) and patient types (e.g., numerous psychological disorders and in psychiatry and neurology). However, automation of speech analysis is a complex task that requires the integration of several different technologies within a large distributed process with numerous stakeholders. Many organizations have raised awareness about the need for robust systems for ensuring transparency, oversight, and regulation of technologies utilizing artificial intelligence. Since there is limited knowledge about the ethical and legal implications of these applications in psychological science, we provide a balanced view of both the optimism that is widely published on and also the challenges and risks of use, including discrimination and exacerbation of structural inequalities.

Automating the analysis of eye movement for different neurodegenerative disorders.,"The clinical observation and assessment of extra-ocular movements is common practice in assessing neurodegenerative disorders but remains observer-dependent. In the present study, we propose an algorithm that can automatically identify saccades, fixation, smooth pursuit, and blinks using a non-invasive eye tracker. Subsequently, response-to-stimuli-derived interpretable features were elicited that objectively and quantitatively assess patient behaviors. The cohort analysis encompasses persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease mimics (PDM), and controls (CTRL). Overall, results suggested that the AD/MCI and PD groups had significantly different saccade and pursuit characteristics compared to CTRL when the target moved faster or covered a larger visual angle during smooth pursuit. These two groups also displayed more omitted antisaccades and longer average antisaccade latency than CTRL. When reading a text passage silently, people with AD/MCI had more fixations. During visual exploration, people with PD demonstrated a more variable saccade duration than other groups. In the prosaccade task, the PD group showed a significantly smaller average hypometria gain and accuracy, with the most statistical significance and highest AUC scores of features studied. The minimum saccade gain was a PD-specific feature different from CTRL and PDM. These features, as oculographic biomarkers, can be potentially leveraged in distinguishing different types of NDs, yielding more objective and precise protocols to diagnose and monitor disease progression.",2024,Biomarkers; Eye tracking; Interpretability; Neurodegenerative disorders,Humans; Eye Movements; Parkinson Disease; Saccades; Alzheimer Disease; Blinking,"Li, D; Butala, AA; Moro-Velazquez, L; Meyer, T; Oh, ES; Motley, C; Villalba, J; Dehak, N"

Automatic motion artefact detection in brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance images from a clinical data warehouse using synthetic data.,"Containing the medical data of millions of patients, clinical data warehouses (CDWs) represent a great opportunity to develop computational tools. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) are particularly sensitive to patient movements during image acquisition, which will result in artefacts (blurring, ghosting and ringing) in the reconstructed image. As a result, a significant number of MRIs in CDWs are corrupted by these artefacts and may be unusable. Since their manual detection is impossible due to the large number of scans, it is necessary to develop tools to automatically exclude (or at least identify) images with motion in order to fully exploit CDWs. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method from research to clinical data for the automatic detection of motion in 3D T1-weighted brain MRI. The method consists of two steps: a pre-training on research data using synthetic motion, followed by a fine-tuning step to generalise our pre-trained model to clinical data, relying on the labelling of 4045 images. The objectives were both (1) to be able to exclude images with severe motion, (2) to detect mild motion artefacts.

Attention-gated 3D CapsNet for robust hippocampal segmentation.,"The hippocampus is organized in subfields (HSF) involved in learning and memory processes and widely implicated in pathologies at different ages of life, from neonatal hypoxia to temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Getting a highly accurate and robust delineation of sub-millimetric regions such as HSF to investigate anatomo-functional hypotheses is a challenge. One of the main difficulties encountered by those methodologies is related to the small size and anatomical variability of HSF, resulting in the scarcity of manual data labeling. Recently introduced, capsule networks solve analogous problems in medical imaging, providing deep learning architectures with rotational equivariance. Nonetheless, capsule networks are still two-dimensional and unassessed for the segmentation of HSF.",2024,MRI; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; equivariance; hippocampal subfields,,"Poiret, C; Bouyeure, A; Patil, S; Boniteau, C; Duchesnay, E; Grigis, A; Lemaitre, F; Noulhiane, M"

SVFR: A novel slice-to-volume feature representation framework using deep neural networks and a clustering model for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been effective in classifying structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel two-phase slice-to-volume feature representation (SVFR) framework for AD diagnosis. Specifically, we design a slice-level feature extractor to automatically select informative slice images and extract their slice-level features, by combining DNN and clustering models. Furthermore, we propose a joint volume-level feature generator and classifier to hierarchically aggregate the slice-level features into volume-level features and to classify images, by devising a spatial pyramid set pooling module and a fusion module. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed SVFR, surpassing the majority of the state-of-the-art methods and achieving comparable results to the best-performing approach. Experimental results also showcase the efficacy of the slice-level feature extractor in the selection of informative slice images, as well as the effectiveness of the volume-level feature generator and classifier in the integration of slice-level features for image classification.

Magnetic resonance image-based brain age as a discriminator of dementia conversion in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"Patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a conversion rate of approximately 10% to dementia within 2 years. We aimed to investigate whether brain age is an important factor in predicting conversion to dementia in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychological evaluation, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and [18F]-florbetaben positron emission tomography. Brain age was determined by the volumetric assessment of 12 distinct brain regions using an automatic segmentation software. During the follow-up period, 38% of the patients converted from amnestic MCI to dementia. Further, 73% of patients had a brain age greater than their actual chronological age. When defining 'survival' as the non-conversion of MCI to dementia, these groups differed significantly in survival probability (p = 0.036). The low-educated female group with a brain age greater than their actual age had the lowest survival rate among all groups. Our findings suggest that the MRI-based brain age used in this study can contribute to predicting conversion to dementia in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI.",2023,,"Humans; Female; Retrospective Studies; Disease Progression; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid; Neuropsychological Tests; Dementia; Alzheimer Disease","Kim, HW; Kim, HJ; Lee, H; Yang, H; Rieu, Z; Lee, JH"
Photostimulation of lymphatic clearance of β-amyloid from mouse brain: a new strategy for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that poses a significant burden on socio-economic and healthcare systems worldwide. However, the currently available therapy of AD is limited, and new strategies are needed to enhance the clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) protein and improve cognitive function. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a non-invasive and effective therapeutic method that has shown promise in treating various brain diseases. Here, we demonstrate that 1267-nm PBM significantly alleviates cognitive decline in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD and is safe as it does not induce a significant increase in cortical temperature. Moreover, with the combination of 3D tissue optical clearing imaging and automatic brain region segmentation, we show that PBM-mediated reductions of Aβ plaques in different subregions of prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are different. The PBM-induced lymphatic clearance of Aβ from the brain is associated with improvement of memory and cognitive functions in 5xFAD mice. Our results suggest that the modulation of meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) should play an important role in promoting Aβ clearance. Collectively, this pilot study demonstrates that PBM can safely accelerate lymphatic clearance of Aβ from the brain of 5xFAD mice, promoting improvement of neurocognitive status of AD animals suggesting that PBM can be an effective and bedside therapy for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid-β clearance; Meningeal lymphatic vessels; Photostimulation,,"Li, D; Lin, H; Sun, S; Liu, S; Liu, Z; He, Y; Zhu, J; Xu, J; Semyachkina-Glushkovskaya, O; Yu, T; Zhu, D"
Accuracy of TrUE-Net in comparison to established white matter hyperintensity segmentation methods: An independent validation study.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are nearly ubiquitous in the aging brain, and their topography and overall burden are associated with cognitive decline. Given their numerosity, accurate methods to automatically segment WMH are needed. Recent developments, including the availability of challenge data sets and improved deep learning algorithms, have led to a new promising deep-learning based automated segmentation model called TrUE-Net, which has yet to undergo rigorous independent validation. Here, we compare TrUE-Net to six established automated WMH segmentation tools, including a semi-manual method. We evaluated the techniques at both global and regional level to compare their ability to detect the established relationship between WMH burden and age. We found that TrUE-Net was highly reliable at identifying WMH regions with low false positive rates, when compared to semi-manual segmentation as the reference standard. TrUE-Net performed similarly or favorably when compared to the other automated techniques. Moreover, TrUE-Net was able to detect relationships between WMH and age to a similar degree as the reference standard semi-manual segmentation at both the global and regional level. These results support the use of TrUE-Net for identifying WMH at the global or regional level, including in large, combined datasets.",2024,Aging; LST; Segmentation Tools; TrUE-Net; WMH,Humans; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Algorithms; Aging; Leukoaraiosis,"Strain, JF; Rahmani, M; Dierker, D; Owen, C; Jafri, H; Vlassenko, AG; Womack, K; Fripp, J; Tosun, D; Benzinger, TLS; Weiner, M; Masters, C; Lee, JM; Morris, JC; Goyal, MS"
Comparison of Anatomical and Diffusion MRI for detecting Parkinson's Disease using Deep Convolutional Neural Network.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects over 10 million people worldwide. Brain atrophy and microstructural abnormalities tend to be more subtle in PD than in other age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, so there is interest in how well machine learning methods can detect PD in radiological scans. Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically distil diagnostically useful features from raw MRI scans, but most CNN-based deep learning models have only been tested on T1-weighted brain MRI. Here we examine the added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) - a variant of MRI, sensitive to microstructural tissue properties - as an additional input in CNN-based models for PD classification. Our evaluations used data from 3 separate cohorts - from Chang Gung University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the PPMI dataset. We trained CNNs on various combinations of these cohorts to find the best predictive model. Although tests on more diverse data are warranted, deep-learned models from dMRI show promise for PD classification.Clinical Relevance- This study supports the use of diffusion-weighted images as an alternative to anatomical images for AI-based detection of Parkinson's disease.",2023,,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Chattopadhyay, T; Singh, A; Laltoo, E; Boyle, CP; Owens-Walton, C; Chen, YL; Cook, P; McMillan, C; Tsai, CC; Wang, JJ; Wu, YR; van der Werf, Y; Thompson, PM"

Automatic MRI volumetry in asymptomatic cases at risk for normal pressure hydrocephalus.,"The occurrence of significant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology was described in approximately 30% of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) cases, leading to the distinction between neurodegenerative and idiopathic forms of this disorder. Whether or not there is a specific MRI signature of NPH remains a matter of debate. The present study focuses on asymptomatic cases at risk for NPH as defined with automatic machine learning tools and combines automatic MRI assessment of cortical and white matter volumetry, risk of AD (AD-RAI), and brain age gap estimation (BrainAge). Our hypothesis was that brain aging and AD process-independent volumetric changes occur in asymptomatic NPH-positive cases. We explored the volumetric changes in normal aging-sensitive (entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus/PHG) and AD-signature areas (hippocampus), four control cortical areas (frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal), and cerebral and cerebellar white matter in 30 asymptomatic cases at risk for NPH (NPH probability >30) compared to 30 NPH-negative cases (NPH probability <5) with preserved cognition. In univariate regression models, NPH positivity was associated with decreased volumes in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and entorhinal cortex bilaterally. The strongest negative association was found in the left hippocampus that persisted when adjusting for AD-RAI and Brain Age values. A combined model including the three parameters explained 36.5% of the variance, left hippocampal volumes, and BrainAge values, which remained independent predictors of the NPH status. Bilateral PHG and entorhinal cortex volumes were negatively associated with NPH-positive status in univariate models but this relationship did not persist when adjusting for BrainAge, the latter remaining the only predictor of the NPH status. We also found a negative association between bilateral cerebral and cerebellar white matter volumes and NPH status that persisted after controlling for AD-RAI or Brain Age values, explaining between 50 and 65% of its variance. These observations support the idea that in cases at risk for NPH, as defined by support vector machine assessment of NPH-related MRI markers, brain aging-related and brain aging and AD-independent volumetric changes coexist. The latter concerns volume loss in restricted hippocampal and white matter areas that could be considered as the MRI signature of idiopathic forms of NPH.",2023,Alzheimer; MRI markers; brain aging; hippocampus; normal pressure hydrocephalus; vector machine assessment; white matter,,"Haller, S; Montandon, ML; Rodriguez, C; Herrmann, FR; Giannakopoulos, P"

WarpDrive: Improving spatial normalization using manual refinements.,"Spatial normalization-the process of mapping subject brain images to an average template brain-has evolved over the last 20+ years into a reliable method that facilitates the comparison of brain imaging results across patients, centers & modalities. While overall successful, sometimes, this automatic process yields suboptimal results, especially when dealing with brains with extensive neurodegeneration and atrophy patterns, or when high accuracy in specific regions is needed. Here we introduce WarpDrive, a novel tool for manual refinements of image alignment after automated registration. We show that the tool applied in a cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease who underwent deep brain stimulation surgery helps create more accurate representations of the data as well as meaningful models to explain patient outcomes. The tool is built to handle any type of 3D imaging data, also allowing refinements in high-resolution imaging, including histology and multiple modalities to precisely aggregate multiple data sources together.",2024,Deep brain stimulation; Image normalization; Interactive registration,"Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Brain Mapping; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Oxenford, S; Ríos, AS; Hollunder, B; Neudorfer, C; Boutet, A; Elias, GJB; Germann, J; Loh, A; Deeb, W; Salvato, B; Almeida, L; Foote, KD; Amaral, R; Rosenberg, PB; Tang-Wai, DF; Wolk, DA; Burke, AD; Sabbagh, MN; Salloway, S; Chakravarty, MM; Smith, GS; Lyketsos, CG; Okun, MS; Anderson, WS; Mari, Z; Ponce, FA; Lozano, A; Neumann, WJ; Al-Fatly, B; Horn, A"
Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Based on the EEG Analysis.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually hurts the central nervous system. By detecting and intervening in the early stage, AD patients could be prevented from memory loss and function decrease. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of the brain's electric action, which reflects the activity of nervous in the brain. Recent studies showed that AD patients' brain action will change in the early stage, and EEG might become a potential marker for AD's early diagnosis. To record and analyze the abnormal transformation in the brain with EEG, researchers and engineers has developed approaches to extract and analyze EEG feature. For the feature extraction, power spectrum analysis, event-related potentials (ERPs) and connectivity analysis could be as the marker for AD diagnosis. And in the feature analysis, Deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN), transfer learning (TL) and generative adversarial network (GAN) could help the automatic diagnosis of AD in the clinic. Based on above review, this article compares advantages and disadvantages of the AD diagnosis based on EEG analysis. In the discussion, different approaches for EEG analysis used in the clinic for AD patients will be introduced and compared.",2023,AD; EEG; Signal analysis; Signal feature extraction,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Electroencephalography; Neural Networks, Computer; Algorithms","Huang, R"
An efficient semi-supervised quality control system trained using physics-based MRI-artefact generators and adversarial training.,"Large medical imaging data sets are becoming increasingly available. A common challenge in these data sets is to ensure that each sample meets minimum quality requirements devoid of significant artefacts. Despite a wide range of existing automatic methods having been developed to identify imperfections and artefacts in medical imaging, they mostly rely on data-hungry methods. In particular, the scarcity of artefact-containing scans available for training has been a major obstacle in the development and implementation of machine learning in clinical research. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework having four main components: (1) a set of artefact generators inspired by magnetic resonance physics to corrupt brain MRI scans and augment a training dataset, (2) a set of abstract and engineered features to represent images compactly, (3) a feature selection process that depends on the class of artefact to improve classification performance, and (4) a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained to identify artefacts. Our novel contributions are threefold: first, we use the novel physics-based artefact generators to generate synthetic brain MRI scans with controlled artefacts as a data augmentation technique. This will avoid the labour-intensive collection and labelling process of scans with rare artefacts. Second, we propose a large pool of abstract and engineered image features developed to identify 9 different artefacts for structural MRI. Finally, we use an artefact-based feature selection block that, for each class of artefacts, finds the set of features that provide the best classification performance. We performed validation experiments on a large data set of scans with artificially-generated artefacts, and in a multiple sclerosis clinical trial where real artefacts were identified by experts, showing that the proposed pipeline outperforms traditional methods. In particular, our data augmentation increases performance by up to 12.5 percentage points on the accuracy, F1, F2, precision and recall. At the same time, the computation cost of our pipeline remains low - less than a second to process a single scan - with the potential for real-time deployment. Our artefact simulators obtained using adversarial learning enable the training of a quality control system for brain MRI that otherwise would have required a much larger number of scans in both supervised and unsupervised settings. We believe that systems for quality control will enable a wide range of high-throughput clinical applications based on the use of automatic image-processing pipelines.",2024,Adversarial training; Artefacts generation; Brain; MRI; Quality control; Real-time processing; Synthetic-images,"Humans; Artifacts; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neuroimaging; Machine Learning","Ravi, D; Barkhof, F; Alexander, DC; Puglisi, L; Parker, GJM; Eshaghi, A"
SaLSa: A Combinatory Approach of Semi-Automatic Labeling and Long Short-Term Memory to Classify Behavioral Syllables.,"Accurately and quantitatively describing mouse behavior is an important area. Although advances in machine learning have made it possible to track their behaviors accurately, reliable classification of behavioral sequences or syllables remains a challenge. In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach, called SaLSa (a combination of semi-automatic labeling and long short-term memory-based classification), to classify behavioral syllables of mice exploring an open field. This approach consists of two major steps. First, after tracking multiple body parts, spatial and temporal features of their egocentric coordinates are extracted. A fully automated unsupervised process identifies candidates for behavioral syllables, followed by manual labeling of behavioral syllables using a graphical user interface (GUI). Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier is trained with the labeled data. We found that the classification performance was marked over 97%. It provides a performance equivalent to a state-of-the-art model while classifying some of the syllables. We applied this approach to examine how hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease develops with age. When the proportion of each behavioral syllable was compared between genotypes and sexes, we found that the characteristic hyperlocomotion of female Alzheimer's disease mice emerges between four and eight months. In contrast, age-related reduction in rearing is common regardless of genotype and sex. Overall, SaLSa enables detailed characterization of mouse behavior.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aging; classification; computational ethology; deep learning; long short-term memory,"Mice; Female; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Memory, Short-Term; Memory, Long-Term","Sakata, S"
The prefrontal cortex: from monkey to man.,"The prefrontal cortex is so important to human beings that, if deprived of it, our behaviour is reduced to action-reactions and automatisms, with no ability to make deliberate decisions. Why does the prefrontal cortex hold such importance in humans? In answer, this review draws on the proximity between humans and other primates, which enables us, through comparative anatomical-functional analysis, to understand the cognitive functions we have in common and specify those that distinguish humans from their closest cousins. First, a focus on the lateral region of the prefrontal cortex illustrates the existence of a continuum between rhesus monkeys (the most studied primates in neuroscience) and humans for most of the major cognitive functions in which this region of the brain plays a central role. This continuum involves the presence of elementary mental operations in the rhesus monkey (e.g. working memory or response inhibition) that are constitutive of 'macro-functions' such as planning, problem-solving and even language production. Second, the human prefrontal cortex has developed dramatically compared to that of other primates. This increase seems to concern the most anterior part (the frontopolar cortex). In humans, the development of the most anterior prefrontal cortex is associated with three major and interrelated cognitive changes: (i) a greater working memory capacity, allowing for greater integration of past experiences and prospective futures; (ii) a greater capacity to link discontinuous or distant data, whether temporal or semantic; and (iii) a greater capacity for abstraction, allowing humans to classify knowledge in different ways, to engage in analogical reasoning or to acquire abstract values that give rise to our beliefs and morals. Together, these new skills enable us, among other things, to develop highly sophisticated social interactions based on language, enabling us to conceive beliefs and moral judgements and to conceptualize, create and extend our vision of our environment beyond what we can physically grasp. Finally, a model of the transition of prefrontal functions between humans and non-human primates concludes this review.",2024,behaviour; cognition; frontal lobes; human; primate,Humans; Animals; Brain Mapping; Prefrontal Cortex; Cognition; Primates; Brain,"Levy, R"
Sex differences in the association of sleep spindle density and cognitive performance among community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with obstructive sleep apnea.,"Recent studies have found associations between obstructive sleep apnea and cognitive decline. The underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigate the associations between changes in micro-architecture, specifically sleep spindles, and cognitive function in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults, some with obstructive sleep apnea, with a focus on sex differences. A total of 125 voluntary participants (mean age 66.0 ± 6.4 years, 64 females) from a larger cohort (participants of the Brain in Motion Studies I and II) underwent 1 night of in-home polysomnography and a neuropsychological battery (sleep and cognitive testing were conducted within 2 weeks of each other). A semi-automatic computerized algorithm was used to score polysomnography data and detect spindle characteristics in non-rapid eye movement Stages 2 and 3 in both frontal and central electrodes. Based on their apnea-hypopnea index, participants were divided into those with no obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index < 5 per hr, n = 21), mild obstructive sleep apnea (5 ≥ apnea-hypopnea index < 15, n = 47), moderate obstructive sleep apnea (15 ≥ apnea-hypopnea index < 30, n = 34) and severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 30, n = 23). There were no significant differences in spindle characteristics between the four obstructive sleep apnea severity groups. Spindle density and percentage of fast spindles were positively associated with some verbal fluency measures on the cognitive testing. Sex might be linked with these associations. Biological sex could play a role in the associations between spindle characteristics and some verbal fluency measures. Obstructive sleep apnea severity was not found to be a contributing factor in this non-clinical community-dwelling cohort.",2024,aging; cognition; community‐dwelling; obstructive sleep apnea; older adults; polysomnography; sleep; sleep apnea; spindles,"Humans; Male; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Female; Aged; Polysomnography; Middle Aged; Cognition; Neuropsychological Tests; Electroencephalography; Sleep; Sleep Stages; Sex Factors; Independent Living; Cohort Studies; Sex Characteristics","Pun, M; Guadagni, V; Longman, RS; Hanly, PJ; Hill, MD; Anderson, TJ; Hogan, DB; Rawling, JM; Poulin, M"
A large-scale volumetric correlated light and electron microscopy study localizes Alzheimer's disease-related molecules in the hippocampus.,"Connectomics is a nascent neuroscience field to map and analyze neuronal networks. It provides a new way to investigate abnormalities in brain tissue, including in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This age-related disease is associated with alterations in amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (pTau). These alterations correlate with AD's clinical manifestations, but causal links remain unclear. Therefore, studying these molecular alterations within the context of the local neuronal and glial milieu may provide insight into disease mechanisms. Volume electron microscopy (vEM) is an ideal tool for performing connectomics studies at the ultrastructural level, but localizing specific biomolecules within large-volume vEM data has been challenging. Here we report a volumetric correlated light and electron microscopy (vCLEM) approach using fluorescent nanobodies as immuno-probes to localize Alzheimer's disease-related molecules in a large vEM volume. Three molecules (pTau, Aβ, and a marker for activated microglia (CD11b)) were labeled without the need for detergents by three nanobody probes in a sample of the hippocampus of the 3xTg Alzheimer's disease model mouse. Confocal microscopy followed by vEM imaging of the same sample allowed for registration of the location of the molecules within the volume. This dataset revealed several ultrastructural abnormalities regarding the localizations of Aβ and pTau in novel locations. For example, two pTau-positive post-synaptic spine-like protrusions innervated by axon terminals were found projecting from the axon initial segment of a pyramidal cell. Three pyramidal neurons with intracellular Aβ or pTau were 3D reconstructed. Automatic synapse detection, which is necessary for connectomics analysis, revealed the changes in density and volume of synapses at different distances from an Aβ plaque. This vCLEM approach is useful to uncover molecular alterations within large-scale volume electron microscopy data, opening a new connectomics pathway to study Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.",2023,,,"Han, X; Li, PH; Wang, S; Sanchez, M; Aggarwal, S; Blakely, T; Schalek, R; Meirovitch, Y; Lin, Z; Berger, D; Wu, Y; Aly, F; Bay, S; Delatour, B; LaFaye, P; Pfister, H; Wei, D; Jain, V; Ploegh, H; Lichtman, J"
A Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation Framework for 3D MRI Classification of Gliomas and Alzheimer's Diseases.,"Accurate and fully automated brain structure examination and prediction from 3D volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a necessary step in medical imaging analysis, which can assist greatly in clinical diagnosis. Traditional deep learning models suffer from severe performance degradation when applied to clinically acquired unlabeled data. The performance degradation is mainly caused by domain discrepancy such as different device types and parameter settings for data acquisition. However, existing approaches focus on the reduction of domain discrepancies but ignore the entanglement of semantic features and domain information. In this article, we explore the feature invariance of categories and domains in different projection spaces and propose a Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation (STDA) method using a joint optimal transport theory and contrastive learning for automatic 3D MRI classification and glioma multi-grade prediction. Specifically, the learning framework updates the distribution of features across domains and categories by Siamese transport network training with an Optimal Cost Transfer Strategy (OCTS) and a Mutual Invariant Constraint (MIC) in two projective spaces to find multiple invariants in potential heterogeneity. We design three sets of transfer task scenarios with different source and target domains, and demonstrate that STDA yields substantially higher generalization performance than other state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods.

This is due to damage to brain tissues, which may lead to cognitive impairment and eventually Alzheimer's. Therefore, the detection of such mild cognitive impairment (MCI) becomes important. Usually, this is detected when it is converted into Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is irreversible and cannot be cured whereas mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be cured. The goal of this research is to diagnose Alzheimer's patients for timely treatment. For this purpose, functional MRI images from the publicly available dataset are used. Various deep-learning models have been used by the scientific community for the automatic detection of Alzheimer's subjects. These include the binary classification of scans of patients into MCI and AD stages, and limited work is carried out for multiclass classification of Alzheimer's disease up to six different stages. This study is divided into two steps. In the first step, a binary classification of the subject's scan is performed using Custom CNN. The second step involves the use of different deep learning models along with Custom CNN for multiclass classification of a subject's scan into one of the six stages of Alzheimer's disease. The models are evaluated based on different evaluation metrics, and the overall result of the models is improved using the max-voting ensembling technique. The experimental results show that an overall average accuracy of 98.8% is achieved for Alzheimer's stages classification.",2023,,"Humans; Aged; Deep Learning; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Cognitive Dysfunction","Tajammal, T; Khurshid, SK; Jaleel, A; Qayyum Wahla, S; Ziar, RA"

Explainable Vision Transformer with Self-Supervised Learning to Predict Alzheimer's Disease Progression Using 18F-FDG PET.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of AD progression is crucial for early intervention and personalized treatment planning. Although AD does not yet have a reliable therapy, several medications help slow down the disease's progression. However, more study is still needed to develop reliable methods for detecting AD and its phases. In the recent past, biomarkers associated with AD have been identified using neuroimaging methods. To uncover biomarkers, deep learning techniques have quickly emerged as a crucial methodology. A functional molecular imaging technique known as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) has been shown to be effective in assisting researchers in understanding the morphological and neurological alterations to the brain associated with AD. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also long dominated the field of AD progression and have been the subject of substantial research, while more recent approaches like vision transformers (ViT) have not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) method to automatically acquire meaningful AD characteristics using the ViT architecture by pretraining the feature extractor using the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) and extreme learning machine (ELM) as classifier models. In this work, we examined a technique for predicting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD utilizing an SSL model which learns powerful representations from unlabeled 18F-FDG PET images, thus reducing the need for large-labeled datasets. In comparison to several earlier approaches, our strategy showed state-of-the-art classification performance in terms of accuracy (92.31%), specificity (90.21%), and sensitivity (95.50%). Then, to make the suggested model easier to understand, we highlighted the brain regions that significantly influence the prediction of MCI development. Our methods offer a precise and efficient strategy for predicting the transition from MCI to AD. In conclusion, this research presents a novel Explainable SSL-ViT model that can accurately predict AD progress based on 18F-FDG PET scans. SSL, attention, and ELM mechanisms are integrated into the model to make it more predictive and interpretable. Future research will enable the development of viable treatments for neurodegenerative disorders by combining brain areas contributing to projection with observed anatomical traits.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; DINO; ELM; FDG-PET; self-supervised learning; vision transformer,,"Khatri, U; Kwon, GR"

A novel cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network framework with spatial self-attention mechanism for hippocampus segmentation.,"Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from the brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a crucial task in the neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus structures is challenging due to the small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries of hippocampus. Although some methods have been developed for the hippocampus segmentation, most of them paid too much attention to the hippocampus shape and volume instead of considering the spatial information. Additionally, the extracted features are independent of each other, ignoring the correlation between the global and local information. In view of this, here we proposed a novel cross-layer dual Encoding-Shared Decoding network framework with Spatial self-Attention mechanism (called ESDSA) for hippocampus segmentation in human brains. Considering that the hippocampus is a relatively small part in MRI, we introduced the spatial self-attention mechanism in ESDSA to capture the spatial information of hippocampus for improving the segmentation accuracy. We also designed a cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network to effectively extract the global information of MRIs and the spatial information of hippocampus. The spatial features of hippocampus and the features extracted from the MRIs were combined to realize the hippocampus segmentation. Results on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data show that the performance of our ESDSA is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and the dice similarity coefficient of ESDSA achieves 89.37%. In addition, the dice similarity coefficient of the Spatial Self-Attention mechanism (SSA) strategy and the dual Encoding-Shared Decoding (ESD) strategy is 9.47%, 5.35% higher than that of the baseline U-net, respectively, indicating that the strategies of SSA and ESD can effectively enhance the segmentation accuracy of human brain hippocampus.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Dual encoding-shared decoding network; Hippocampus segmentation; Magnetic resonance images; Spatial self-attention mechanism,"Humans; Hippocampus; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Neuroimaging; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Li, JN; Zhang, SW; Qiang, YR; Zhou, QY"
Automatic assessment of connected speech and its relation to memory in Alzheimer's Disease in low education.,"Discourse is one of the main linguistic aspects affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its relationship with memory needs to be further studied, mainly in low education and low socioeconomic status (SES) groups.

Time-frequency analysis of speech signal using Chirplet transform for automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world after Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosing PD is challenging as it evolved slowly, and its symptoms eventuate gradually. Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in speech may be utilized as an excellent biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we have proposed a Chirplet transform (CT) based novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech signals. We employed CT to get the time-frequency matrix (TFM) of each speech recording, and we extracted time-frequency based entropy (TFE) features from the TFM. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the TFE features reflect the changes in speech that occurs in the speech due to PD, hence can be used for classifying the PD and healthy control (HC) individuals. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using the vowels and words from the PC-GITA database. The genetic algorithm is utilized to select the optimum features subset, while a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers are employed for classification. The TFE features outperform the breathiness and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features. The SVM classifier is most effective compared to other machine-learning classifiers. The highest classification accuracy rates of 98% and 99% are achieved using the vowel /a/ and word /atleta/, respectively. The results reveal that the proposed CT-based entropy features effectively diagnose PD using the speech of a person.",2023,Chirplet transform; Genetic algorithm; Parkinson’s disease (PD); Speech Pathology; Support vector machine; Time-frequency representation,,"Warule, P; Mishra, SP; Deb, S"

Combination of deep learning and 2D CARS figures for identification of amyloid-β plaques.,"In vivo imaging and accurate identification of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque are crucial in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. In this work, we propose to combine the coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, a powerful detection technology for providing Raman spectra and label-free imaging, with deep learning to distinguish Aβ from non-Aβ regions in AD mice brains in vivo. The 1D CARS spectra is firstly converted to 2D CARS figures by using two different methods: spectral recurrence plot (SRP) and spectral Gramian angular field (SGAF). This can provide more learnable information to the network, improving the classification precision. We then devise a cross-stage attention network (CSAN) that automatically learns the features of Aβ plaques and non-Aβ regions by taking advantage of the computational advances in deep learning. Our algorithm yields higher accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity than the results of conventional multivariate statistical analysis method and 1D CARS spectra combined with deep learning, demonstrating its competence in identifying Aβ plaques. Last but not least, the CSAN framework requires no prior information on the imaging modality and may be applicable to other spectroscopy analytical fields.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Deep Learning; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Nonlinear Optical Microscopy; Plaque, Amyloid; Brain","Luo, Z; Zhu, G; Xu, H; Lin, D; Li, J; Qu, J"

Improving Alzheimer Diagnoses With An Interpretable Deep Learning Framework: Including Neuropsychiatric Symptoms.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive cognitive decline. Among the various clinical symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) commonly occur during the course of AD. Previous researches have demonstrated a strong association between NPS and severity of AD, while the research methods are not sufficiently intuitive. Here, we report a hybrid deep learning framework for AD diagnosis using multimodal inputs such as structural MRI, behavioral scores, age, and gender information. The framework uses a 3D convolutional neural network to automatically extract features from MRI. The imaging features are passed to the Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, which fuse with non-imaging information to improve the diagnosis of AD. According to the experimental results, our model achieves an accuracy of 0.91 and an area under the curve of 0.97 in the task of classifying AD and cognitively normal individuals. SHapley Additive exPlanations are used to visually exhibit the contribution of specific NPS in the proposed model. Among all behavioral symptoms, apathy plays a particularly important role in the diagnosis of AD, which can be considered a valuable factor in further studies, as well as clinical trials.",2023,3D CNN; Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; neuropsychiatric symptoms; structural MRI,"Humans; Deep Learning; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuroimaging","Liu, S; Zheng, Y; Li, H; Pan, M; Fang, Z; Liu, M; Qiao, Y; Pan, N; Jia, W; Ge, X"

Dynamic functional connectivity MEG features of Alzheimer's disease.,"Dynamic resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) characterizes time-varying fluctuations of functional brain network activity. While many studies have investigated static functional connectivity, it has been unclear whether features of dynamic functional connectivity are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Popular sliding-window and clustering methods for extracting dynamic RSFC have various limitations that prevent extracting reliable features to address this question. Here, we use a novel and robust time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) approach to extract the dynamic RSFC features from high resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and matched controls. The TVDN algorithm automatically and adaptively learns the low-dimensional spatiotemporal manifold of dynamic RSFC and detects dynamic state transitions in data. We show that amongst all the functional features we investigated, the dynamic manifold features are the most predictive of AD. These include: the temporal complexity of the brain network, given by the number of state transitions and their dwell times, and the spatial complexity of the brain network, given by the number of eigenmodes. These dynamic features have higher sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing AD from healthy subjects than the existing benchmarks do. Intriguingly, we found that AD patients generally have higher spatial complexity but lower temporal complexity compared with healthy controls. We also show that graph theoretic metrics of dynamic component of TVDN are significantly different in AD versus controls, while static graph metrics are not statistically different. These results indicate that dynamic RSFC features are impacted in neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease, and may be crucial to understanding the pathophysiological trajectory of these diseases.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Brain state switch; Dementia; Dynamic resting state; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance; Magnetoencephalography; Multi-modality imaging,Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain,"Jin, H; Ranasinghe, KG; Prabhu, P; Dale, C; Gao, Y; Kudo, K; Vossel, K; Raj, A; Nagarajan, SS; Jiang, F"
Noninvasive automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease from spontaneous speech: a review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered as one of the leading causes of death among people over the age of 70 that is characterized by memory degradation and language impairment. Due to language dysfunction observed in individuals with AD patients, the speech-based methods offer non-invasive, convenient, and cost-effective solutions for the automatic detection of AD. This paper systematically reviews the technologies to detect the onset of AD from spontaneous speech, including data collection, feature extraction and classification. First the paper formulates the task of automatic detection of AD and describes the process of data collection. Then, feature extractors from speech data and transcripts are reviewed, which mainly contains acoustic features from speech and linguistic features from text. Especially, general handcrafted features and deep embedding features are organized from different modalities. Additionally, this paper summarizes optimization strategies for AD detection systems. Finally, the paper addresses challenges related to data size, model explainability, reliability and multimodality fusion, and discusses potential research directions based on these challenges.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; classification; dataset; deep learning; machine learning; optimization; spontaneous speech,,"Qi, X; Zhou, Q; Dong, J; Bao, W"
Automatic Segmentation of Retinal Layers in Multiple Neurodegenerative Disorder Scenarios.,"Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) allows the non-invasive direct observation of the central nervous system, enabling the measurement and extraction of biomarkers from neural tissue that can be helpful in the assessment of ocular, systemic and Neurological Disorders (ND). Deep learning models can be trained to segment the retinal layers for biomarker extraction. However, the onset of ND can have an impact on the neural tissue, which can lead to the degraded performance of models not exposed to images displaying signs of disease during training. We present a fully automatic approach for the retinal layer segmentation in multiple neurodegenerative disorder scenarios, using an annotated dataset of patients of the most prevalent NDs: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and essential tremor, along with healthy control patients. Furthermore, we present a two-part, comprehensive study on the effects of ND on the performance of these models. The results show that images of healthy patients may not be sufficient for the robust training of automated segmentation models intended for the analysis of ND patients, and that using images representative of different NDs can increase the model performance. These results indicate that the presence or absence of patients of ND in datasets should be taken into account when training deep learning models for retinal layer segmentation, and that the proposed approach can provide a valuable tool for the robust and reliable diagnosis in multiple scenarios of ND.",2023,,"Humans; Retina; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Multiple Sclerosis; Parkinson Disease","Gende, M; Mallen, V; de Moura, J; Cordon, B; Garcia-Martin, E; Sanchez, CI; Novo, J; Ortega, M"
ADscreen: A speech processing-based screening system for automatic identification of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11 % of older adults in the United States. Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of patients with ADRD, >50 % of them are not diagnosed and unaware of their disease. To address this challenge, we developed ADscreen, an innovative speech-processing based ADRD screening algorithm for the protective identification of patients with ADRD. ADscreen consists of five major components: (i) noise reduction for reducing background noises from the audio-recorded patient speech, (ii) modeling the patient's ability in phonetic motor planning using acoustic parameters of the patient's voice, (iii) modeling the patient's ability in semantic and syntactic levels of language organization using linguistic parameters of the patient speech, (iv) extracting vocal and semantic psycholinguistic cues from the patient speech, and (v) building and evaluating the screening algorithm. To identify important speech parameters (features) associated with ADRD, we used the Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM), an effective feature selection method for high dimensional, small sample size datasets. Modeling the relationship between speech parameters and the outcome variable (presence/absence of ADRD) was conducted using three different machine learning (ML) architectures with the capability of joining informative acoustic and linguistic with contextual word embedding vectors obtained from the DistilBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We evaluated the performance of the ADscreen on an audio-recorded patients' speech (verbal description) for the Cookie-Theft picture description task, which is publicly available in the dementia databank. The joint fusion of acoustic and linguistic parameters with contextual word embedding vectors of DistilBERT achieved F1-score = 84.64 (standard deviation [std] = ±3.58) and AUC-ROC = 92.53 (std = ±3.34) for training dataset, and F1-score = 89.55 and AUC-ROC = 93.89 for the test dataset. In summary, ADscreen has a strong potential to be integrated with clinical workflow to address the need for an ADRD screening tool so that patients with cognitive impairment can receive appropriate and timely care.",2023,Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Screening algorithm; Speech analysis,Aged; Humans; Acoustics; Alzheimer Disease; Linguistics; Speech; Mass Screening,"Zolnoori, M; Zolnour, A; Topaz, M"
Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption and Perivascular Spaces in Small Vessel Disease and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review on MRI Methods and Insights.,"Perivascular spaces (PVS) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption are two key features of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and neurodegenerative diseases that have been linked to cognitive impairment and are involved in the cerebral waste clearance system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers the possibility to study these pathophysiological processes noninvasively in vivo. This educational review provides an overview of the MRI techniques used to assess PVS functionality and BBB disruption. MRI-visible PVS can be scored on structural images by either (subjectively) counting or (automatically) delineating the PVS. We highlight emerging (diffusion) techniques to measure proxies of perivascular fluid and its movement, which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of PVS in diseases. For the measurement of BBB disruption, we explain the most commonly used MRI technique, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, as well as a more recently developed technique based on arterial spin labeling (ASL). DCE MRI and ASL are thought to measure complementary characteristics of the BBB. Furthermore, we describe clinical studies that have utilized these MRI techniques in cSVD and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). These studies demonstrate the role of PVS and BBB dysfunction in these diseases and provide insight into the large overlap, but also into the differences between cSVD and AD. Overall, MRI techniques may provide valuable insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these diseases and have the potential to be used as markers for disease progression and treatment response.

Although several attempts have been made to use RCFT in clinical settings in a digitalized format, little attention has been given to develop direct automatic scoring that is comparable to experienced psychologists.

Validating ASHS-T1 automated entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical segmentation in Alzheimer's disease.,"The current study aimed to validate entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes measured by the automated segmentation tool Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS-T1). The study sample comprised 34 healthy controls (HCs), 37 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 29 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes were assessed using ASHS-T1, manual segmentation, as well as a widely used automated segmentation tool, FreeSurfer v6.0.1. Mean differences, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Bland-Altman plots were computed. ASHS-T1 tended to underestimate entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes relative to manual segmentation and FreeSurfer. There was variable consistency and low agreement between ASHS-T1 and manual segmentation volumes. There was low-to-moderate consistency and low agreement between ASHS-T1 and FreeSurfer volumes. There was a trend toward higher consistency and agreement for the entorhinal cortex in the aMCI and AD groups compared to the HC group. Despite the differences in volume measurements, ASHS-T1 was sensitive to entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical atrophy in both early and late disease stages. Based on the current study, ASHS-T1 appears to be a promising tool for automated entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volume measurement in individuals with likely underlying AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Automated segmentation; Entorhinal cortex; Magnetic resonance imaging; Manual segmentation; Transentorhinal cortex,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Entorhinal Cortex","Quek, YE; Bourgeat, P; Fung, YL; Vogrin, SJ; Collins, SJ; Bowden, SC"

Automatic Preprocessing Pipeline for White Matter Functional Analyses of Large-Scale Databases.,"Recently, increasing evidence suggests that fMRI signals in white matter (WM), conventionally ignored as nuisance, are robustly detectable using appropriate processing methods and are related to neural activity, while changes in WM with aging and degeneration are also well documented. These findings suggest variations in patterns of BOLD signals in WM should be investigated. However, existing fMRI analysis tools, which were designed for processing gray matter signals, are not well suited for large-scale processing of WM signals in fMRI data. We developed an automatic pipeline for high-performance preprocessing of fMRI images with emphasis on quantifying changes in BOLD signals in WM in an aging population. At the image processing level, the pipeline integrated existing software modules with fine parameter tunings and modifications to better extract weaker WM signals. The preprocessing results primarily included whole-brain time-courses, functional connectivity, maps and tissue masks in a common space. At the job execution level, this pipeline exploited a local XNAT to store datasets and results, while using DAX tool to automatic distribute batch jobs that run on high-performance computing clusters. Through the pipeline, 5,034 fMRI/T1 scans were preprocessed. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of test-retest experiment based on the preprocessed data is 0.52 - 0.86 (N=1000), indicating a high reliability of our pipeline, comparable to previously reported ICC in gray matter experiments.

Acoustic stimulation has emerged as a promising approach to enhance slow-wave activity in healthy adults and people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. In this phase 1 study we investigated, for the first time, the feasibility of acoustic stimulation in AD and piloted the effect on slow-wave sleep (SWS).",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; acoustic stimulation; sleep; slow-wave sleep; wearable device,"Adult; Humans; Sleep, Slow-Wave; Acoustic Stimulation; Pilot Projects; Alzheimer Disease; Electroencephalography; Sleep","Van den Bulcke, L; Peeters, AM; Heremans, E; Davidoff, H; Borzée, P; De Vos, M; Emsell, L; Van den Stock, J; De Roo, M; Tournoy, J; Buyse, B; Vandenbulcke, M; Van Audenhove, C; Testelmans, D; Van Den Bossche, M"
The Objective Dementia Severity Scale Based on MRI with Contrastive Learning: A Whole Brain Neuroimaging Perspective.,"In the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, one of the most important tasks is evaluating its severity for diagnosis and therapy. However, traditional testing methods are deficient, such as their susceptibility to subjective factors, incomplete evaluation, low accuracy, or insufficient granularity, resulting in unreliable evaluation scores. To address these issues, we propose an objective dementia severity scale based on MRI (ODSS-MRI) using contrastive learning to automatically evaluate the neurological function of patients. The approach utilizes a deep learning framework and a contrastive learning strategy to mine relevant information from structural magnetic resonance images to obtain the patient's neurological function level score. Given that the model is driven by the patient's whole brain imaging data, but without any possible biased manual intervention or instruction from the physician or patient, it provides a comprehensive and objective evaluation of the patient's neurological function. We conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and the results showed that the proposed ODSS-MRI was correlated with the stages of AD 88.55% better than all existing methods. This demonstrates its efficacy to describe the neurological function changes of patients during AD progression. It also outperformed traditional psychiatric rating scales in discriminating different stages of AD, which is indicative of its superiority for neurological function evaluation.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; contrastive learning; disease evaluation; medical robots,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain,"Zhang, Y; Fan, W; Chen, X; Li, W"
An Efficient Ensemble Approach for Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using an Adaptive Synthetic Technique and Deep Learning.,"Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurological disorder that leads to a gradual decline in cognitive abilities, but early detection can significantly mitigate symptoms. The automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is more important due to the shortage of expert medical staff, because it reduces the burden on medical staff and enhances the results of diagnosis. A detailed analysis of specific brain disorder tissues is required to accurately diagnose the disease via segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Several studies have used the traditional machine-learning approaches to diagnose the disease from MRI, but manual extracted features are more complex, time-consuming, and require a huge amount of involvement from expert medical staff. The traditional approach does not provide an accurate diagnosis. Deep learning has automatic extraction features and optimizes the training process. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Alzheimer's disease dataset consists of four classes: mild demented (896 images), moderate demented (64 images), non-demented (3200 images), and very mild demented (2240 images). The dataset is highly imbalanced. Therefore, we used the adaptive synthetic oversampling technique to address this issue. After applying this technique, the dataset was balanced. The ensemble of VGG16 and EfficientNet was used to detect Alzheimer's disease on both imbalanced and balanced datasets to validate the performance of the models. The proposed method combined the predictions of multiple models to make an ensemble model that learned complex and nuanced patterns from the data. The input and output of both models were concatenated to make an ensemble model and then added to other layers to make a more robust model. In this study, we proposed an ensemble of EfficientNet-B2 and VGG-16 to diagnose the disease at an early stage with the highest accuracy. Experiments were performed on two publicly available datasets. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved 97.35% accuracy and 99.64% AUC for multiclass datasets and 97.09% accuracy and 99.59% AUC for binary-class datasets. We evaluated that the proposed method was extremely efficient and provided superior performance on both datasets as compared to previous methods.",2023,ADASYN; Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; medical MRI brain images; optimized ensemble model,,"Mujahid, M; Rehman, A; Alam, T; Alamri, FS; Fati, SM; Saba, T"
Alzheimer Disease Pathology and Neurodegeneration in Midlife Obesity: A Pilot Study.,"Obesity and excess adiposity at midlife are risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD). Visceral fat is known to be associated with insulin resistance and a pro-inflammatory state, the two mechanisms involved in AD pathology. We assessed the association of obesity, MRI-determined abdominal adipose tissue volumes, and insulin resistance with PET-determined amyloid and tau uptake in default mode network areas, and MRI-determined brain volume and cortical thickness in AD cortical signature in the cognitively normal midlife population. Thirty-two middle-aged (age: 51.27±6.12 years, 15 males, body mass index (BMI): 32.28±6.39 kg/m2) cognitively normal participants, underwent bloodwork, brain and abdominal MRI, and amyloid and tau PET scan. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT, SAT) were semi-automatically segmented using VOXel Analysis Suite (Voxa). FreeSurfer was used to automatically segment brain regions using a probabilistic atlas. PET scans were acquired using [11C]PiB and AV-1451 tracers and were analyzed using PET unified pipeline. The association of brain volumes, cortical thicknesses, and PiB and AV-1451 standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) with BMI, VAT/SAT ratio, and insulin resistance were assessed using Spearman's partial correlation. VAT/SAT ratio was associated significantly with PiB SUVRs in the right precuneus cortex (p=0.034) overall, controlling for sex. This association was significant only in males (p=0.044), not females (p=0.166). Higher VAT/SAT ratio and PiB SUVRs in the right precuneus cortex were associated with lower cortical thickness in AD-signature areas predominantly including bilateral temporal cortices, parahippocampal, medial orbitofrontal, and cingulate cortices, with age and sex as covariates. Also, higher BMI and insulin resistance were associated with lower cortical thickness in bilateral temporal poles. In midlife cognitively normal adults, we demonstrated higher amyloid pathology in the right precuneus cortex in individuals with a higher VAT/SAT ratio, a marker of visceral obesity, along with a lower cortical thickness in AD-signature areas associated with higher visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and amyloid pathology.",2023,,,"Dolatshahi, M; Commean, PK; Rahmani, F; Liu, J; Lloyd, L; Nguyen, C; Hantler, N; Ly, M; Yu, G; Ippolito, JE; Sirlin, C; Morris, JC; Benzinger, TLS; Raji, CA"

A new automatic method for tracking rats in the Morris water maze.,"Morris water maze (MWM) test is widely used to evaluate the learning and memory deficits in rodents. Image processing and pattern recognition can be used to analyse videos and recognize automatically the tracking in MWM. There are several commercial and free access software that allows analyzing the behavioral tasks although they also have limitations such as automation, cost, user intervention among other things. The aim of this paper was to develop a new image processing technique to automatically analyse the track of the rat in the MWM, which we called RatsTrack. The MWM test was performed with an animal model for Alzheimer, and the videos were recorded to measure the distance, time, and speed. The segmentation method based on the projection of the video frames was made for pool identification, eliminating the rat, while conserving the shape of the pool. Then, the Hough transformation was used to recognize the position and radius of the pool. Finally, the frame in which the rat is released into the pool was established automatically using mathematical morphology techniques and added as a plugin on free access ImageJ software. The new image processing technique, RatsTrack, successfully detected and located the pool and rat without user intervention, significantly decreasing operational time and providing results for distance, time, speed, and acceleration parameters of the MWM test. Alzheimer's rats compared with the control group presented significant data measured with the RatsTrack. RatsTrack is a plugin of ImageJ software and will be made freely available for public use.",2023,Image processing; ImageJ; Memory; Morris water maze; Pattern recognition; Tracking,,"Forero, MG; Hernández, NC; Morera, CM; Aguilar, LA; Aquino, R; Baquedano, LE"

Speech and language markers of neurodegeneration: a call for global equity.,"In the field of neurodegeneration, speech and language assessments are useful for diagnosing aphasic syndromes and for characterizing other disorders. As a complement to classic tests, scalable and low-cost digital tools can capture relevant anomalies automatically, potentially supporting the quest for globally equitable markers of brain health. However, this promise remains unfulfilled due to limited linguistic diversity in scientific works and clinical instruments. Here we argue for cross-linguistic research as a core strategy to counter this problem. First, we survey the contributions of linguistic assessments in the study of primary progressive aphasia and the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Second, we address two forms of linguistic unfairness in the literature: the neglect of most of the world's 7000 languages and the preponderance of English-speaking cohorts. Third, we review studies showing that linguistic dysfunctions in a given disorder may vary depending on the patient's language and that English speakers offer a suboptimal benchmark for other language groups. Finally, we highlight different approaches, tools and initiatives for cross-linguistic research, identifying core challenges for their deployment. Overall, we seek to inspire timely actions to counter a looming source of inequity in behavioural neurology.",2023,cross-linguistic research; language diversity; linguistic testing; neurodegenerative diseases,Humans; Speech; Language; Aphasia; Linguistics; Alzheimer Disease,"García, AM; de Leon, J; Tee, BL; Blasi, DE; Gorno-Tempini, ML"
FIESTA: Autoencoders for accurate fiber segmentation in tractography.,"White matter bundle segmentation is a cornerstone of modern tractography to study the brain's structural connectivity in domains such as neurological disorders, neurosurgery, and aging. In this study, we present FIESTA (FIbEr Segmentation in Tractography using Autoencoders), a reliable and robust, fully automated, and easily semi-automatically calibrated pipeline based on deep autoencoders that can dissect and fully populate white matter bundles. This pipeline is built upon previous works that demonstrated how autoencoders can be used successfully for streamline filtering, bundle segmentation, and streamline generation in tractography. Our proposed method improves bundle segmentation coverage by recovering hard-to-track bundles with generative sampling through the latent space seeding of the subject bundle and the atlas bundle. A latent space of streamlines is learned using autoencoder-based modeling combined with contrastive learning. Using an atlas of bundles in standard space (MNI), our proposed method segments new tractograms using the autoencoder latent distance between each tractogram streamline and its closest neighbor bundle in the atlas of bundles. Intra-subject bundle reliability is improved by recovering hard-to-track streamlines, using the autoencoder to generate new streamlines that increase the spatial coverage of each bundle while remaining anatomically correct. Results show that our method is more reliable than state-of-the-art automated virtual dissection methods such as RecoBundles, RecoBundlesX, TractSeg, White Matter Analysis and XTRACT. Our framework allows for the transition from one anatomical bundle definition to another with marginal calibration efforts. Overall, these results show that our framework improves the practicality and usability of current state-of-the-art bundle segmentation framework.",2023,Autoencoder; Bundle segmentation; Fiber tractography; Generative sampling; Representation learning; dMRI,"Humans; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; White Matter; Dissection; Brain","Dumais, F; Legarreta, JH; Lemaire, C; Poulin, P; Rheault, F; Petit, L; Barakovic, M; Magon, S; Descoteaux, M; Jodoin, PM"

AI Body Composition in Lung Cancer Screening: Added Value Beyond Lung Cancer Detection.,"Background An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm has been developed for fully automated body composition assessment of lung cancer screening noncontrast low-dose CT of the chest (LDCT) scans, but the utility of these measurements in disease risk prediction models has not been assessed. Purpose To evaluate the added value of CT-based AI-derived body composition measurements in risk prediction of lung cancer incidence, lung cancer death, cardiovascular disease (CVD) death, and all-cause mortality in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the NLST, body composition measurements, including area and attenuation attributes of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue, were derived from baseline LDCT examinations by using a previously developed AI algorithm. The added value of these measurements was assessed with sex- and cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with and without the AI-derived body composition measurements for predicting lung cancer incidence, lung cancer death, CVD death, and all-cause mortality.

Here, we describe a toolbox of machine learning (ML) models for automatic detection and analysis of SWRs. The ML architectures, which resulted from a crowdsourced hackathon, are able to capture a wealth of SWR features recorded in the dorsal hippocampus of mice. When applied to data from the macaque hippocampus, these models were able to generalize detection and revealed shared SWR properties across species.

Automatic Assessment of the 2-Minute Walk Distance for Remote Monitoring of People with Multiple Sclerosis.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of automatically assessing the 2-Minute Walk Distance (2MWD) for monitoring people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). For 154 pwMS, MS-related clinical outcomes as well as the 2MWDs as evaluated by clinicians and derived from accelerometer data were collected from a total of 323 periodic clinical visits. Accelerometer data from a wearable device during 100 home-based 2MWD assessments were also acquired. The error in estimating the 2MWD was validated for walk tests performed at hospital, and then the correlation (r) between clinical outcomes and home-based 2MWD assessments was evaluated. Robust performance in estimating the 2MWD from the wearable device was obtained, yielding an error of less than 10% in about two-thirds of clinical visits. Correlation analysis showed that there is a strong association between the actual and the estimated 2MWD obtained either at hospital (r = 0.71) or at home (r = 0.58). Furthermore, the estimated 2MWD exhibits moderate-to-strong correlation with various MS-related clinical outcomes, including disability and fatigue severity scores. Automatic assessment of the 2MWD in pwMS is feasible with the usage of a consumer-friendly wearable device in clinical and non-clinical settings.

Explainable Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Linguistic Features from Automatic Speech Recognition.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia and can cause abnormal cognitive function and progressive loss of essential life skills. Early screening is thus necessary for the prevention and intervention of AD. Speech dysfunction is an early onset symptom of AD patients. Recent studies have demonstrated the promise of automated acoustic assessment using acoustic or linguistic features extracted from speech. However, most previous studies have relied on manual transcription of text to extract linguistic features, which weakens the efficiency of automated assessment.

Consensus Paper: Cerebellum and Ageing.,"Given the key roles of the cerebellum in motor, cognitive, and affective operations and given the decline of brain functions with aging, cerebellar circuitry is attracting the attention of the scientific community. The cerebellum plays a key role in timing aspects of both motor and cognitive operations, including for complex tasks such as spatial navigation. Anatomically, the cerebellum is connected with the basal ganglia via disynaptic loops, and it receives inputs from nearly every region in the cerebral cortex. The current leading hypothesis is that the cerebellum builds internal models and facilitates automatic behaviors through multiple interactions with the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and spinal cord. The cerebellum undergoes structural and functional changes with aging, being involved in mobility frailty and related cognitive impairment as observed in the physio-cognitive decline syndrome (PCDS) affecting older, functionally-preserved adults who show slowness and/or weakness. Reductions in cerebellar volume accompany aging and are at least correlated with cognitive decline. There is a strongly negative correlation between cerebellar volume and age in cross-sectional studies, often mirrored by a reduced performance in motor tasks. Still, predictive motor timing scores remain stable over various age groups despite marked cerebellar atrophy. The cerebello-frontal network could play a significant role in processing speed and impaired cerebellar function due to aging might be compensated by increasing frontal activity to optimize processing speed in the elderly. For cognitive operations, decreased functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) is correlated with lower performances. Neuroimaging studies highlight that the cerebellum might be involved in the cognitive decline occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD), independently of contributions of the cerebral cortex. Grey matter volume loss in AD is distinct from that seen in normal aging, occurring initially in cerebellar posterior lobe regions, and is associated with neuronal, synaptic and beta-amyloid neuropathology. Regarding depression, structural imaging studies have identified a relationship between depressive symptoms and cerebellar gray matter volume. In particular, major depressive disorder (MDD) and higher depressive symptom burden are associated with smaller gray matter volumes in the total cerebellum as well as the posterior cerebellum, vermis, and posterior Crus I. From the genetic/epigenetic standpoint, prominent DNA methylation changes in the cerebellum with aging are both in the form of hypo- and hyper-methylation, and the presumably increased/decreased expression of certain genes might impact on motor coordination. Training influences motor skills and lifelong practice might contribute to structural maintenance of the cerebellum in old age, reducing loss of grey matter volume and therefore contributing to the maintenance of cerebellar reserve. Non-invasive cerebellar stimulation techniques are increasingly being applied to enhance cerebellar functions related to motor, cognitive, and affective operations. They might enhance cerebellar reserve in the elderly. In conclusion, macroscopic and microscopic changes occur in the cerebellum during the lifespan, with changes in structural and functional connectivity with both the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. With the aging of the population and the impact of aging on quality of life, the panel of experts considers that there is a huge need to clarify how the effects of aging on the cerebellar circuitry modify specific motor, cognitive, and affective operations both in normal subjects and in brain disorders such as AD or MDD, with the goal of preventing symptoms or improving the motor, cognitive, and affective symptoms.",2024,Affective; Aging; Alzheimer’s Disease; Cerebellum; Cognitive; Motor,"Adult; Humans; Aged; Depressive Disorder, Major; Cross-Sectional Studies; Consensus; Quality of Life; Cerebellum; Aging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Arleo, A; Bareš, M; Bernard, JA; Bogoian, HR; Bruchhage, MMK; Bryant, P; Carlson, ES; Chan, CCH; Chen, LK; Chung, CP; Dotson, VM; Filip, P; Guell, X; Habas, C; Jacobs, HIL; Kakei, S; Lee, TMC; Leggio, M; Misiura, M; Mitoma, H; Olivito, G; Ramanoël, S; Rezaee, Z; Samstag, CL; Schmahmann, JD; Sekiyama, K; Wong, CHY; Yamashita, M; Manto, M"

EEG-based classification of individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders using deep neural networks: A systematic review of current status and future directions.,"The use of deep neural networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has rapidly progressed and gained popularity in recent years, but automatic feature extraction from EEG signals remains a challenging task. The classification of neuropsychiatric disorders demands the extraction of neuro-markers for use in automated EEG classification. Numerous advanced deep learning algorithms can be used for this purpose. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the main factors and parameters that affect the performance of deep neural networks in classifying different neuropsychiatric disorders using EEG signals. We also analyze the EEG features used for improving classification performance. Our analysis includes 82 scientific journal papers that applied deep neural networks for subject-wise classification based on EEG signals. We extracted information on the EEG dataset and types of disorders, deep neural network structures, performance, and hyperparameters. The results show that most studies have focused on clinical classification, achieving an average accuracy of 91.83 ± 7.34, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being the most frequently used network architecture and resting-state EEG signals being the most commonly used data type. Additionally, the review reveals that depression (N = 18), Alzheimer's (N = 11), and schizophrenia (N = 11) were studied more frequently than other types of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our review provides insight into the performance of deep neural networks in EEG classification and highlights the importance of EEG feature extraction in improving classification accuracy. By identifying the main factors and parameters that affect deep neural network performance in EEG classification, our review can guide future research in this area. We hope that our findings will encourage further exploration of deep learning methods for EEG classification and contribute to the development of more accurate and effective methods for diagnosing and monitoring neuropsychiatric disorders using EEG signals.",2023,Brain activity; Conventional neural network; Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Neural network; Neuro-markers; Recurrent neural network,"Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Algorithms; Electroencephalography","Parsa, M; Rad, HY; Vaezi, H; Hossein-Zadeh, GA; Setarehdan, SK; Rostami, R; Rostami, H; Vahabie, AH"

Evaluation of volumetric asymmetry of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe in Alzheimer's disease using the atlas-based method.,"Brain areas affected during neurodegenerative disease progression are considered anatomically connected to the first affected areas. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has connections with the medial temporal lobe (MTL), which includes regions that become atrophic in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the degree of volumetric asymmetry of DLPFC and MTL structures. This is a cross-sectional volumetric study involving 25 Alzheimer's disease patients and 25 healthy adults who underwent MRI with a 3D turbo spin echo sequence at 1.5 Tesla. The atlas-based method incorporated MRIStudio software to automatically measure the volume of brain structures. We compared the asymmetry index and volumetric changes across study groups and correlated them with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. We observed significant volumetric rightward lateralization in the DLPFC and superior frontal gyrus in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to the healthy controls. There was a significant volume loss in the MTL structures of Alzheimer's disease patients. Atrophy of MTL structures was positively correlated with right DLPFC volume changes in Alzheimer's disease patients. Volumetric asymmetry of the DLPFC may be a characteristic for determining disease progression in Alzheimer's disease patients. Future studies are recommended to evaluate whether these volumetric asymmetrical changes are specific to Alzheimer's disease and whether asymmetry measurements can serve as diagnostic markers.",2023,,Adult; Humans; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Atrophy; Temporal Lobe,"Karaca, O; Tepe, N; Ozcan, E"
NORHA: A NORmal Hippocampal Asymmetry Deviation Index Based on One-Class Novelty Detection and 3D Shape Features.,"Radiologists routinely analyze hippocampal asymmetries in magnetic resonance (MR) images as a biomarker for neurodegenerative conditions like epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease. However, current clinical tools rely on either subjective evaluations, basic volume measurements, or disease-specific models that fail to capture more complex differences in normal shape. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by introducing NORHA, a novel NORmal Hippocampal Asymmetry deviation index that uses machine learning novelty detection to objectively quantify it from MR scans. NORHA is based on a One-Class Support Vector Machine model learned from a set of morphological features extracted from automatically segmented hippocampi of healthy subjects. Hence, in test time, the model automatically measures how far a new unseen sample falls with respect to the feature space of normal individuals. This avoids biases produced by standard classification models, which require being trained using diseased cases and therefore learning to characterize changes produced only by the ones. We evaluated our new index in multiple clinical use cases using public and private MRI datasets comprising control individuals and subjects with different levels of dementia or epilepsy. The index reported high values for subjects with unilateral atrophies and remained low for controls or individuals with mild or severe symmetric bilateral changes. It also showed high AUC values for discriminating individuals with hippocampal sclerosis, further emphasizing its ability to characterize unilateral abnormalities. Finally, a positive correlation between NORHA and the functional cognitive test CDR-SB was observed, highlighting its promising application as a biomarker for dementia.",2023,Hippocampus; Machine learning; Normal asymmetries; Novelty detection,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Hippocampus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers,"Deangeli, D; Iarussi, F; Külsgaard, H; Braggio, D; Princich, JP; Bendersky, M; Iarussi, E; Larrabide, I; Orlando, JI"

Using Health Forum Data to Assess User Needs for mHealth App Development: A Feasibility Study on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Online health forums are used by patients and caregivers as community and information resources, especially for chronic disease management, and could help determine user needs for digital health app design. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using online forum posts on Alzheimer's disease to inform user needs in mobile health application design and whether this process can be automated through text clustering methods. A total of 413 posts were analyzed manually through thematic coding and yielded three themes and nine subthemes for patient and caregiver needs. The external evaluation showed fair to substantial similarity between the automatically and manually derived labels. Four personas were developed to assess the validity of forum-generated needs. These results establish that health forum data can provide sufficient information to understand user needs. However, further refinement of the analysis process and algorithm is necessary to generalize this method to other disease conditions and types of forum data.",2023,,,"Wu, DTY; Bindhu, S; Vu, H; Mu, S; Xu, C; Pandey, S; Harnett, B; Lee, JJ"

End-to-end automatic pathology localization for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using structural MRI.,"Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an essential part of the clinical assessment of patients at risk of Alzheimer dementia. One key challenge in sMRI-based computer-aided dementia diagnosis is to localize local pathological regions for discriminative feature learning. Existing solutions predominantly depend on generating saliency maps for pathology localization and handle the localization task independently of the dementia diagnosis task, leading to a complex multi-stage training pipeline that is hard to optimize with weakly-supervised sMRI-level annotations. In this work, we aim to simplify the pathology localization task and construct an end-to-end automatic localization framework (AutoLoc) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To this end, we first present an efficient pathology localization paradigm that directly predicts the coordinate of the most disease-related region in each sMRI slice. Then, we approximate the non-differentiable patch-cropping operation with the bilinear interpolation technique, which eliminates the barrier to gradient backpropagation and thus enables the joint optimization of localization and diagnosis tasks. Extensive experiments on commonly used ADNI and AIBL datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially, we achieve 93.38% and 81.12% accuracy on Alzheimer's disease classification and mild cognitive impairment conversion prediction tasks, respectively. Several important brain regions, such as rostral hippocampus and globus pallidus, are identified to be highly associated with Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis; Differentiable patch-cropping; End-to-end joint learning; Location coordinate prediction; Pathology localization,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Brain; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Cognitive Dysfunction","Cao, G; Zhang, M; Wang, Y; Zhang, J; Han, Y; Xu, X; Huang, J; Kang, G"

How can platelet proteomics best be used to interrogate disease?,"Various modifications of proteins and the resulting proteoforms of a protein can associate with many diseases and are also significantly involved in the rapid regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. For example, the release of prostacyclin from the intact endothelium and the consequent following phosphorylation of VASP in platelets is a post-translational regulation to keep them in a quiescent state. In Alzheimer's disease, proteoforms arise from the altered cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, which finally causes amyloid plaques in the brain. This changed processing of the amyloid precursor protein can also be detected in platelets, making them an attractive source of biomarkers for this neurodegenerative disease. Age-related or prothrombotic disorders can have multiple origins, including genomic, transcriptional, and translational factors, which together can be mapped at the proteome level. Hence, recording these dynamic protein changes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions is paramount in platelet proteomics. To effectively study diseases through platelet proteomics, it is crucial to consider platelets' primary regulatory mechanism and thoroughly evaluate the disparities between the two leading proteomics technologies, top-down and bottom-up approaches. This commentary provides insights into the differences between these two technologies, which are particularly noticeable in detecting the different proteoforms of a protein.",2023,,"Humans; Proteomics; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Blood Platelets; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteome","Zellner, M"

Comparing the effects of four common drug classes on the progression of mild cognitive impairment to dementia using electronic health records.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the potential association between the use of four frequently prescribed drug classes, namely antihypertensive drugs, statins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and proton-pump inhibitors, and the likelihood of disease progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia using electronic health records (EHRs). We conducted a retrospective cohort study using observational EHRs from a cohort of approximately 2 million patients seen at a large, multi-specialty urban academic medical center in New York City, USA between 2008 and 2020 to automatically emulate the randomized controlled trials. For each drug class, two exposure groups were identified based on the prescription orders documented in the EHRs following their MCI diagnosis. During follow-up, we measured drug efficacy based on the incidence of dementia and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of various drugs. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we confirmed the ATE estimates via bootstrapping and presented associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our analysis identified 14,269 MCI patients, among whom 2501 (17.5%) progressed to dementia. Using average treatment estimation and bootstrapping confirmation, we observed that drugs including rosuvastatin (ATE = - 0.0140 [- 0.0191, - 0.0088], p value < 0.001), citalopram (ATE = - 0.1128 [- 0.125, - 0.1005], p value < 0.001), escitalopram (ATE = - 0.0560 [- 0.0615, - 0.0506], p value < 0.001), and omeprazole (ATE = - 0.0201 [- 0.0299, - 0.0103], p value < 0.001) have a statistically significant association in slowing the progression from MCI to dementia.

Comparison of Anatomical and Diffusion MRI for detecting Parkinson's Disease using Deep Convolutional Neural Network.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects over 10 million people worldwide. Brain atrophy and microstructural abnormalities tend to be more subtle in PD than in other age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, so there is interest in how well machine learning methods can detect PD in radiological scans. Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically distil diagnostically useful features from raw MRI scans, but most CNN-based deep learning models have only been tested on T1-weighted brain MRI. Here we examine the added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) - a variant of MRI, sensitive to microstructural tissue properties - as an additional input in CNN-based models for PD classification. Our evaluations used data from 3 separate cohorts - from Chang Gung University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the PPMI dataset. We trained CNNs on various combinations of these cohorts to find the best predictive model. Although tests on more diverse data are warranted, deep-learned models from dMRI show promise for PD classification.",2023,,,"Chattopadhyay, T; Singh, A; Laltoo, E; Boyle, CP; Owens-Walton, C; Chen, YL; Cook, P; McMillan, C; Tsai, CC; Wang, JJ; Wu, YR; van der Werf, Y; Thompson, PM"
Automatic Analysis of MRI Images for Early Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Stages Based on Hybrid Features of CNN and Handcrafted Features.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered one of the challenges facing health care in the modern century; until now, there has been no effective treatment to cure it, but there are drugs to slow its progression. Therefore, early detection of Alzheimer's is vital to take needful measures before it develops into brain damage which cannot be treated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have contributed to the diagnosis and prediction of its progression. MRI images require highly experienced doctors and radiologists, and the analysis of MRI images takes time to analyze each slice. Thus, deep learning techniques play a vital role in analyzing a huge amount of MRI images with high accuracy to detect Alzheimer's and predict its progression. Because of the similarities in the characteristics of the early stages of Alzheimer's, this study aimed to extract the features in several methods and integrate the features extracted from more than one method into the same features matrix. This study contributed to the development of three methodologies, each with two systems, with all systems aimed at achieving satisfactory accuracy for the detection of AD and predicting the stages of its progression. The first methodology is by Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) with the features of GoogLeNet and DenseNet-121 models separately. The second methodology is by FFNN network with combined features between GoogLeNet and Dense-121 models before and after high-dimensionality reduction of features using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. The third methodology is by FFNN network with combined features between GoogLeNet and Dense-121 models separately and features extracted by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods called handcrafted features. All systems yielded super results in detecting AD and predicting the stages of its progression. With the combined features of the DenseNet-121 and handcrafted, the FFNN achieved an accuracy of 99.7%, sensitivity of 99.64%, AUC of 99.56%, precision of 99.63%, and a specificity of 99.67%.",2023,AD; CNN; DWT; FFNN; GLCM; LBP; fusion features,,"Khalid, A; Senan, EM; Al-Wagih, K; Al-Azzam, MMA; Alkhraisha, ZM"

AANet: Attentive All-level Fusion Deep Neural Network Approach for Multi-modality Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Multi-modality deep learning models have recently been used for disease diagnosis; however, effectively integrating diverse, complex, and heterogeneous data remains a challenge.

We first constructed a deep learning feature pyramid network for whole-brain brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature extraction. We then leveraged the self-attention-based all-level fusion method by automatically adjusting weights of all-level MRI image features, patient demographics, blood biomarkers, and genetic data. We trained and tested AANet on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for the task of classifying mild cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease, a challenging task in early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. AANet achieved an accuracy of 90.5%, outperformed several state-of-the-art methods.

"A comparison of machine learning approaches for the quantification of microglial cells in the brain of mice, rats and non-human primates.","Microglial cells are brain-specific macrophages that swiftly react to disruptive events in the brain. Microglial activation leads to specific modifications, including proliferation, morphological changes, migration to the site of insult, and changes in gene expression profiles. A change in inflammatory status has been linked to many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. For this reason, the investigation and quantification of microglial cells is essential for better understanding their role in disease progression as well as for evaluating the cytocompatibility of novel therapeutic approaches for such conditions. In the following study we implemented a machine learning-based approach for the fast and automatized quantification of microglial cells; this tool was compared with manual quantification (ground truth), and with alternative free-ware such as the threshold-based ImageJ and the machine learning-based Ilastik. We first trained the algorithms on brain tissue obtained from rats and non-human primate immunohistochemically labelled for microglia. Subsequently we validated the accuracy of the trained algorithms in a preclinical rodent model of Parkinson's disease and demonstrated the robustness of the algorithms on tissue obtained from mice, as well as from images provided by three collaborating laboratories. Our results indicate that machine learning algorithms can detect and quantify microglial cells in all the three mammalian species in a precise manner, equipotent to the one observed following manual counting. Using this tool, we were able to detect and quantify small changes between the hemispheres, suggesting the power and reliability of the algorithm. Such a tool will be very useful for investigation of microglial response in disease development, as well as in the investigation of compatible novel therapeutics targeting the brain. As all network weights and labelled training data are made available, together with our step-by-step user guide, we anticipate that many laboratories will implement machine learning-based quantification of microglial cells in their research.",2023,,Mice; Rats; Animals; Microglia; Parkinson Disease; Reproducibility of Results; Brain; Primates; Machine Learning; Mammals,"Anwer, DM; Gubinelli, F; Kurt, YA; Sarauskyte, L; Jacobs, F; Venuti, C; Sandoval, IM; Yang, Y; Stancati, J; Mazzocchi, M; Brandi, E; O'Keeffe, G; Steece-Collier, K; Li, JY; Deierborg, T; Manfredsson, FP; Davidsson, M; Heuer, A"

Regional Deep Atrophy: a Self-Supervised Learning Method to Automatically Identify Regions Associated With Alzheimer's Disease Progression From Longitudinal MRI.,"Longitudinal assessment of brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus, is a well-studied biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In clinical trials, estimation of brain progressive rates can be applied to track therapeutic efficacy of disease modifying treatments. However, most state-of-the-art measurements calculate changes directly by segmentation and/or deformable registration of MRI images, and may misreport head motion or MRI artifacts as neurodegeneration, impacting their accuracy. In our previous study, we developed a deep learning method DeepAtrophy that uses a convolutional neural network to quantify differences between longitudinal MRI scan pairs that are associated with time. DeepAtrophy has high accuracy in inferring temporal information from longitudinal MRI scans, such as temporal order or relative inter-scan interval. DeepAtrophy also provides an overall atrophy score that was shown to perform well as a potential biomarker of disease progression and treatment efficacy. However, DeepAtrophy is not interpretable, and it is unclear what changes in the MRI contribute to progression measurements. In this paper, we propose Regional Deep Atrophy (RDA), which combines the temporal inference approach from DeepAtrophy with a deformable registration neural network and attention mechanism that highlights regions in the MRI image where longitudinal changes are contributing to temporal inference. RDA has similar prediction accuracy as DeepAtrophy, but its additional interpretability makes it more acceptable for use in clinical settings, and may lead to more sensitive biomarkers for disease monitoring in clinical trials of early AD.",2023,,,"Dong, M; Xie, L; Das, SR; Wang, J; Wisse, LEM; deFlores, R; Wolk, DA; Yushkevich, PA"

Cortical thickness is related to cognitive-motor automaticity and attention allocation in individuals with Alzheimer's disease: a regions of interest study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a distinct pattern of cortical thinning and resultant changes in cognition and function. These result in prominent deficits in cognitive-motor automaticity. The relationship between AD-related cortical thinning and decreased automaticity is not well-understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between cortical thickness regions-of-interest (ROI) and automaticity and attention allocation in AD using hypothesis-driven and exploratory approaches. We performed an ROI analysis of 46 patients with AD. Data regarding MR images, demographic characteristics, cognitive-motor dual task performance, and cognition were extracted from medical records. Cortical thickness was calculated from MR T1 images using FreeSurfer. Data from the dual task assessment was used to calculate the combined dual task effect (cDTE), a measure of cognitive-motor automaticity, and the modified attention allocation index (mAAI). Four hierarchical multiple linear regression models were conducted regressing cDTE and mAAI separately on (1) hypothesis-generated ROIs and (2) exploratory ROIs. For cDTE, cortical thicknesses explained 20.5% (p = 0.014) and 25.9% (p = 0.002) variability in automaticity in the hypothesized ROI and exploratory models, respectively. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (β =  - 0.479, p = 0.018) and superior parietal cortex (SPC) (β = 0.467, p = 0.003), and were predictors of automaticity. For mAAI, cortical thicknesses explained 20.7% (p = 0.025) and 28.3% (p = 0.003) variability in attention allocation in the hypothesized ROI and exploratory models, respectively. Thinning of SPC and fusiform gyrus were associated with motor prioritization (β =  - 0.405, p = 0.013 and β =  - 0.632, p = 0.004, respectively), whereas thinning of the DLPFC was associated with cognitive prioritization (β = 0.523, p = 0.022). Cortical thinning in AD was related to cognitive-motor automaticity and task prioritization, particularly in the DLPFC and SPC.

Automatic and manual segmentation of the piriform cortex: Method development and validation in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease.,"The piriform cortex (PC) is located at the junction of the temporal and frontal lobes. It is involved physiologically in olfaction as well as memory and plays an important role in epilepsy. Its study at scale is held back by the absence of automatic segmentation methods on MRI. We devised a manual segmentation protocol for PC volumes, integrated those manually derived images into the Hammers Atlas Database (n = 30) and used an extensively validated method (multi-atlas propagation with enhanced registration, MAPER) for automatic PC segmentation. We applied automated PC volumetry to patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE; n = 174 including n = 58 controls) and to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI; n = 151, of whom with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 71; Alzheimer's disease (AD), n = 33; controls, n = 47).

Accurate Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using Lightweight Deep Learning Model on MRI Data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment and aberrant protein deposition in the brain. Therefore, the early detection of AD is crucial for the development of effective treatments and interventions, as the disease is more responsive to treatment in its early stages. It is worth mentioning that deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in recent years to a wide range of medical imaging tasks, including the detection of AD. These techniques have the ability to automatically learn and extract features from large datasets, making them well suited for the analysis of complex medical images. In this paper, we propose an improved lightweight deep learning model for the accurate detection of AD from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Our proposed model achieves high detection performance without the need for deeper layers and eliminates the use of traditional methods such as feature extraction and classification by combining them all into one stage. Furthermore, our proposed method consists of only seven layers, making the system less complex than other previous deep models and less time-consuming to process. We evaluate our proposed model using a publicly available Kaggle dataset, which contains a large number of records in a small dataset size of only 36 Megabytes. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.22% for binary classification and 95.93% for multi-classification tasks, which outperformed other previous models. Our study is the first to combine all methods used in the publicly available Kaggle dataset for AD detection, enabling researchers to work on a dataset with new challenges. Our findings show the effectiveness of our lightweight deep learning framework to achieve high accuracy in the classification of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Kaggle dataset; MRI data; deep learning; detection; lightweight model,,"El-Latif, AAA; Chelloug, SA; Alabdulhafith, M; Hammad, M"
Attention-Guided Autoencoder for Automated Progression Prediction of Subjective Cognitive Decline With Structural MRI.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which happens even earlier than mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Progressive SCD will convert to MCI with the potential of further evolving to AD. Therefore, early identification of progressive SCD with neuroimaging techniques (e.g., structural MRI) is of great clinical value for early intervention of AD. However, existing MRI-based machine/deep learning methods usually suffer the small-sample-size problem and lack interpretability. To this end, we propose an interpretable autoencoder model with domain transfer learning (IADT) for progression prediction of SCD. Firstly, the proposed model can leverage MRIs from both the target domain (i.e., SCD) and auxiliary domains (e.g., AD and NC) for progressive SCD identification. Besides, it can automatically locate the disease-related brain regions of interest (defined in brain atlases) through an attention mechanism, which shows good interpretability. In addition, the IADT model is straightforward to train and test with only 5  ∼ 10 seconds on CPUs and is suitable for medical tasks with small datasets. Extensive experiments on the publicly available ADNI dataset and a private CLAS dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2023,,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Machine Learning; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression,"Guan, H; Yue, L; Yap, PT; Xiao, S; Bozoki, A; Liu, M"

Temperament & Character account for brain functional connectivity at rest: A diathesis-stress model of functional dysregulation in psychosis.,"The human brain's resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) provides stable trait-like measures of differences in the perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning of individuals. The rsFC of the prefrontal cortex is hypothesized to mediate a person's rational self-government, as is also measured by personality, so we tested whether its connectivity networks account for vulnerability to psychosis and related personality configurations. Young adults were recruited as outpatients or controls from the same communities around psychiatric clinics. Healthy controls (n = 30) and clinically stable outpatients with bipolar disorder (n = 35) or schizophrenia (n = 27) were diagnosed by structured interviews, and then were assessed with standardized protocols of the Human Connectome Project. Data-driven clustering identified five groups of patients with distinct patterns of rsFC regardless of diagnosis. These groups were distinguished by rsFC networks that regulate specific biopsychosocial aspects of psychosis: sensory hypersensitivity, negative emotional balance, impaired attentional control, avolition, and social mistrust. The rsFc group differences were validated by independent measures of white matter microstructure, personality, and clinical features not used to identify the subjects. We confirmed that each connectivity group was organized by differential collaborative interactions among six prefrontal and eight other automatically-coactivated networks. The temperament and character traits of the members of these groups strongly accounted for the differences in rsFC between groups, indicating that configurations of rsFC are internal representations of personality organization. These representations involve weakly self-regulated emotional drives of fear, irrational desire, and mistrust, which predispose to psychopathology. However, stable outpatients with different diagnoses (bipolar or schizophrenic psychoses) were highly similar in rsFC and personality. This supports a diathesis-stress model in which different complex adaptive systems regulate predisposition (which is similar in stable outpatients despite diagnosis) and stress-induced clinical dysfunction (which differs by diagnosis).",2023,,Young Adult; Humans; Temperament; Disease Susceptibility; Psychotic Disorders; Brain; Personality; Connectome; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Zwir, I; Arnedo, J; Mesa, A; Del Val, C; de Erausquin, GA; Cloninger, CR"

Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction with MRI Data in Neuroimaging Genetics for Alzheimer's Disease.,"The prognosis and treatment of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been among the most important and challenging problems over the last few decades. To better understand the mechanism of AD, it is of great interest to identify genetic variants associated with brain atrophy. Commonly, in these analyses, neuroimaging features are extracted based on one of many possible brain atlases with FreeSurf and other popular software; this, however, may cause the loss of important information due to our incomplete knowledge about brain function embedded in these suboptimal atlases. To address the issue, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) models applied to three-dimensional MRI data for the whole brain or multiple, divided brain regions to perform completely data-driven and automatic feature extraction. These image-derived features are then used as endophenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify associated genetic variants. When we applied this method to ADNI data, we identified several associated SNPs that have been previously shown to be related to several neurodegenerative/mental disorders, such as AD, depression, and schizophrenia.",2023,CNNs; SNPs; endophenotypes; genome-wide association study (GWAS); principle components (PCs),Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Deep Learning; Genome-Wide Association Study; Neuroimaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Chakraborty, D; Zhuang, Z; Xue, H; Fiecas, MB; Shen, X; Pan, W"

Microglial Phagocytosis/Cell Health High-Content Assay.,"We report a microglial phagocytosis/cell health high-content assay that has been used to test small molecule chemical probes and support our drug discovery projects targeting microglia for Alzheimer's disease therapy. The assay measures phagocytosis and cell health (cell count and nuclear intensity) simultaneously in 384-well plates processed with an automatic liquid handler. The mix-and-read live cell imaging assay is highly reproducible with capacity to meet drug discovery research needs. Assay procedures take 4 days including plating cells, treating cells, adding pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris to cells for phagocytosis, staining cell nuclei before performing high-content imaging, and analysis. Three selected parameters are measured from cells: 1) mean total fluorescence intensity per cell of pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris in phagocytosis vesicles to quantify phagocytosis; 2) cell counts per well (measuring compound effects on proliferation and cell death); and 3) average nuclear intensity (measuring compound induced apoptosis). The assay has been used on HMC3 cells (an immortalized human microglial cell line), BV2 cells (an immortalized mouse microglial cell line), and primary microglia isolated from mouse brains. Simultaneous measurements of phagocytosis and cell health allow for the distinction of compound effects on regulation of phagocytosis from cellular stress/toxicity related changes, a distinguishing feature of the assay. The combination of cell counts and nuclear intensity as indicators of cell health is also an effective way to measure cell stress and compound cytotoxicity, which may have broad applications as simultaneous profiling measurements for other phenotypic assays. © 2023 The Authors.

Automatic segmentation of the choroid plexuses: Method and validation in controls and patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Choroid Plexuses (ChP) are structures located in the ventricles that produce the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central nervous system. They are also a key component of the blood-CSF barrier. Recent studies have described clinically relevant ChP volumetric changes in several neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, a reliable and automated tool for ChP segmentation on images derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial need for large studies attempting to elucidate their role in neurological disorders. Here, we propose a novel automatic method for ChP segmentation in large imaging datasets. The approach is based on a 2-step 3D U-Net to keep preprocessing steps to a minimum for ease of use and to lower memory requirements. The models are trained and validated on a first research cohort including people with MS and healthy subjects. A second validation is also performed on a cohort of pre-symptomatic MS patients having acquired MRIs in routine clinical practice. Our method reaches an average Dice coefficient of 0.72 ± 0.01 with the ground truth and a volume correlation of 0.86 on the first cohort while outperforming FreeSurfer and FastSurfer-based ChP segmentations. On the dataset originating from clinical practice, the method reaches a Dice coefficient of 0.67 ± 0.01 (being close to the inter-rater agreement of 0.64 ± 0.02) and a volume correlation of 0.84. These results demonstrate that this is a suitable and robust method for the segmentation of the ChP both on research and clinical datasets.",2023,Choroid plexus; Deep learning; Multiple sclerosis; Radiologically isolated syndrome; Segmentation,"Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Parkinson Disease; Choroid; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Yazdan-Panah, A; Schmidt-Mengin, M; Ricigliano, VAG; Soulier, T; Stankoff, B; Colliot, O"
Automatic Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Deep Learning Models and Neuro-Imaging: Current Trends and Future Perspectives.,"Deep learning algorithms have a huge influence on tackling research issues in the field of medical image processing. It acts as a vital aid for the radiologists in producing accurate results toward effective disease diagnosis. The objective of this research is to highlight the importance of deep learning models in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The main objective of this research is to analyze different deep learning methods used for detecting AD. This study examines 103 research articles published in various research databases. These articles have been selected based on specific criteria to find the most relevant findings in the field of AD detection. The review was carried out based on deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transfer Learning (TL). To propose accurate methods for the detection, segmentation, and severity grading of AD, the radiological features need to be examined in greater depth. This review attempts to analyze different deep learning methods applied for AD detection using neuroimaging modalities like Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc. The focus of this review is restricted to deep learning works based on radiological imaging data for AD detection. There are a few works that have utilized other biomarkers to understand the effect of AD. Also, articles published in English were alone considered for analysis. This work concludes by highlighting the key research issues towards effective AD detection.

The effects of white matter hyperintensities on MEG power spectra in population with mild cognitive impairment.,"Cerebrovascular disease is responsible for up to 20% of cases of dementia worldwide, but also it is a major comorbid contributor to the progression of other neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are the most prevalent imaging marker in cerebrovascular disease. The presence and progression of WMH in the brain have been associated with general cognitive impairment and the risk to develop all types of dementia. The aim of this piece of work is the assessment of brain functional differences in an MCI population based on the WMH volume. One-hundred and twenty-nine individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent a neuropsychological evaluation, MRI assessment (T1 and Flair), and MEG recordings (5 min of eyes closed resting state).

Class activation attention transfer neural networks for MCI conversion prediction.,"Accurate prediction of the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from an early stage is of substantial value for treatment and planning to delay the onset of AD. We propose a novel attention transfer method to train a 3D convolutional neural network to predict which patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to AD within 3 years. A model is first trained on a separate but related source task (task we are transferring information from) to automatically learn regions of interest (ROI) from a given image. Next we train a model to simultaneously classify progressive MCI (pMCI) and stable MCI (sMCI) (the target task we want to solve) and the ROIs learned from the source task. The predicted ROIs are then used to focus the model's attention on certain areas of the brain when classifying pMCI versus sMCI. Thus, in contrast to traditional transfer learning, we transfer attention maps instead of transferring model weights from a source task to the target classification task. Our Method outperformed all methods tested including traditional transfer learning and methods that used expert knowledge to define ROI. Furthermore, the attention map transferred from the source task highlights known Alzheimer's pathology.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Attention mechanism; Class activation maps; Convolutional neural networks; Mild Cognitive impairment; Prediction,"Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neural Networks, Computer; Brain; Attention; Alzheimer Disease","Luo, M; He, Z; Cui, H; Chen, YP; Ward, P"

Regulating the disenfranchised: Reciprocity & resistance under the Mental Capacity Act.,"This paper interrogates the legitimacy of formal ethical regulation regarding people with dementia under the Mental Capacity Act, 2005 in England and Wales. Under the Act, research among people diagnosed with dementia must be approved by Health Research Authority committees, irrespective of whether that research engages with health organisations or service users. As examples, I discuss two ethnographic dementia studies that do not engage with healthcare services, but which nonetheless require HRA approval. These instances raise questions regarding legitimacy and reciprocity in the governance of dementia. Through capacity legislation, the state exerts control over people with dementia, automatically delineating them as healthcare subjects because of their diagnoses. This diagnosis functions as a form of administrative medicalisation, rendering dementia a medical entity and those diagnosed with it the property of formal healthcare. However, many people with dementia in England and Wales do not receive related health or care services beyond diagnosis. This institutional imbalance of high governance and low support undermines the contractual citizenship of people with dementia, wherein state-citizen rights and responsibilities should be reciprocal. In response, I consider resistance to this system in ethnographic research. ""Resistance"" here is not necessarily deliberate, hostile, difficult or perceived, but rather encompasses micropolitical effects that are contrary to power or control, sometimes emerging from systems themselves rather than individual resistive actors. Resistance can be unintentional, through mundane failures to satisfy specific aspects of governance bureaucracies. It can also be deliberate, through refusals to comply with restrictions that seem cumbersome, inapplicable or unethical, potentially raising questions of malpractice and misconduct. I suggest that resistance is made more probable due to the expansion of governance bureaucracies. On the one hand, the potential for both unintentional and intentional transgression increases, while on the other hand, the capacity for those transgressions to be discovered and rectified decreases, because the maintenance of control over such a system requires vast resources. Behind this ethico-bureaucratic tumult, people with dementia themselves are largely invisible. People with dementia often have no interaction with committees that determine their research participation. This further renders ethical governance a particularly disenfranchising facet of the dementia research economy. The state stipulates that people with dementia must be treated differently because of their diagnoses, without consulting those people. In response, resistance to unethical governance could be intuitively deemed ethical per se, but I suggest that such a simplistic binary is somewhat misleading.",2023,Alzheimer; Dementia; Ethics; IRB; MCA; REC,"Humans; Anthropology, Cultural; England; Health Facilities; Dementia","Fletcher, JR"
Adversarial confound regression and uncertainty measurements to classify heterogeneous clinical MRI in Mass General Brigham.,"In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, MUCRAN (Multi-Confound Regression Adversarial Network), to train a deep learning model on clinical brain MRI while regressing demographic and technical confounding factors. We trained MUCRAN using 17,076 clinical T1 Axial brain MRIs collected from Massachusetts General Hospital before 2019 and demonstrated that MUCRAN could successfully regress major confounding factors in the vast clinical dataset. We also applied a method for quantifying uncertainty across an ensemble of these models to automatically exclude out-of-distribution data in AD detection. By combining MUCRAN and the uncertainty quantification method, we showed consistent and significant increases in the AD detection accuracy for newly collected MGH data (post-2019; 84.6% with MUCRAN vs. 72.5% without MUCRAN) and for data from other hospitals (90.3% from Brigham and Women's Hospital and 81.0% from other hospitals).

2D-dwell-time analysis with simulations of ion-channel gating using high-performance computing.,"Single-channel patch-clamp recordings allow observing the action of a single protein complex in real time and hence the deduction of the underlying conformational changes in the ion-channel protein. Commonly, recordings are modeled using hidden Markov chains, connecting open and closed states in the experimental data with protein conformations. The rates between states denote transition probabilities that could be modified by membrane voltage or ligand binding. Modeling algorithms have to deal with limited recording bandwidth and a very noisy background. It was previously shown that the fit of two-dimensional (2D)-dwell-time histograms with simulations is very robust in that regard. Errors introduced by the low-pass filter or noise cancel out to a certain degree when comparing experimental and simulated data. In addition, the topology of models (that is, the chain of open and closed states) could be inferred from 2D-histograms. However, the 2D-fit was never applied to its full potential. A major reason may be the extremely time-consuming and often unreliable fitting process, due to the stochastic variability in the simulations. We have now solved these issues by introducing a message-passing interface (MPI) allowing massive parallel computing on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster and obtaining ensemble solutions. With ensembles, we have demonstrated how important ranked solutions are for difficult tasks related to a noisy background, fast gating events beyond the corner frequency of the low-pass filter, and topology estimation of the underlying Markov model. Finally, we have shown that, by combining the objective function of the 2D-fit with the deviation of the current amplitude distributions, automatic determination of the current level of the conducting state is possible, even with an apparent current reduction due to low-pass filtering. Making use of an HPC cluster, the power of 2D-dwell-time analysis can be used to its fullest with minor input of the experimenter.",2023,,"Ion Channels; Kinetics; Ion Channel Gating; Markov Chains; Algorithms; Models, Biological","Oikonomou, E; Gruber, T; Chandra, AR; Höller, S; Alzheimer, C; Wellein, G; Huth, T"
Vision as a piece of the head trauma puzzle.,"Approximately half of the brain's circuits are involved in vision and control of eye movements. Therefore, visual dysfunction is a common symptom of concussion, the mildest form of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Photosensitivity, vergence dysfunction, saccadic abnormalities, and distortions in visual perception have been reported as vision-related symptoms following concussion. Impaired visual function has also been reported in populations with a lifetime history of TBI. Consequently, vision-based tools have been developed to detect and diagnose concussion in the acute setting, and characterize visual and cognitive function in those with a lifetime history of TBI. Rapid automatized naming (RAN) tasks have provided widely accessible and quantitative measures of visual-cognitive function. Laboratory-based eye tracking approaches demonstrate promise in measuring visual function and validating results from RAN tasks in patients with concussion. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has detected neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis and may provide critical insight into chronic conditions related to TBI, such as traumatic encephalopathy syndrome. Here, we review the literature and discuss the future directions of vision-based assessments of concussion and conditions related to TBI.",2023,,Humans; Craniocerebral Trauma; Brain Concussion; Vision Disorders; Eye Movements; Saccades,"Bell, CA; Grossman, SN; Balcer, LJ; Galetta, SL"
Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the Clock Drawing Test to Reveal the Cognitive Impairment Pattern.,"The prevalence of dementia is currently increasing worldwide. This syndrome produces a deterioration in cognitive function that cannot be reverted. However, an early diagnosis can be crucial for slowing its progress. The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is a widely used paper-and-pencil test for cognitive assessment in which an individual has to manually draw a clock on a paper. There are a lot of scoring systems for this test and most of them depend on the subjective assessment of the expert. This study proposes a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze the CDT and obtain an automatic diagnosis of cognitive impairment (CI). This system employs a preprocessing pipeline in which the clock is detected, centered and binarized to decrease the computational burden. Then, the resulting image is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the informative patterns within the CDT drawings that are relevant for the assessment of the patient's cognitive status. Performance is evaluated in a real context where patients with CI and controls have been classified by clinical experts in a balanced sample size of [Formula: see text] drawings. The proposed method provides an accuracy of [Formula: see text] in the binary case-control classification task, with an AUC of [Formula: see text]. These results are indeed relevant considering the use of the classic version of the CDT. The large size of the sample suggests that the method proposed has a high reliability to be used in clinical contexts and demonstrates the suitability of CAD systems in the CDT assessment process.

"DementiaBank: Theoretical Rationale, Protocol, and Illustrative Analyses.","Dementia from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized primarily by a significant decline in memory abilities; however, language abilities are also commonly affected and may precede the decline of other cognitive abilities. To study the progression of language, there is a need for open-access databases that can be used to build algorithms to produce translational models sensitive enough to detect early declines in language abilities. DementiaBank is an open-access repository of transcribed video/audio data from communicative interactions from people with dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls.

Convolution Neural Networks and Self-Attention Learners for Alzheimer Dementia Diagnosis from Brain MRI.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can help in the early detection of associated cognitive impairment. The aim of this work is to improve the automatic detection of dementia in MRI brain data. For this purpose, we used an established pipeline that includes the registration, slicing, and classification steps. The contribution of this research was to investigate for the first time, to our knowledge, three current and promising deep convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet) and two transformer-based architectures (MAE and DeiT) for mapping input images to clinical diagnosis. To allow a fair comparison, the experiments were performed on two publicly available datasets (ADNI and OASIS) using multiple benchmarks obtained by changing the number of slices per subject extracted from the available 3D voxels. The experiments showed that very deep ResNet and DenseNet models performed better than the shallow ResNet and VGG versions tested in the literature. It was also found that transformer architectures, and DeiT in particular, produced the best classification results and were more robust to the noise added by increasing the number of slices. A significant improvement in accuracy (up to 7%) was achieved compared to the leading state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for the use of CAD approaches in real-world applications.",2023,MRI; assistive technology; computer-aided diagnosis; deep learning; masked auto-encoders; medical image analysis; vision transformers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Deep Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain","Carcagnì, P; Leo, M; Del Coco, M; Distante, C; De Salve, A"
Early identification of seizure freedom with medical treatment in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis.,Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is usually associated with a poor response to antiseizure medications.

Multicenter Evaluation of AI-generated DIR and PSIR for Cortical and Juxtacortical Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Detection.,"Background Cortical multiple sclerosis lesions are clinically relevant but inconspicuous at conventional clinical MRI. Double inversion recovery (DIR) and phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) are more sensitive but often unavailable. In the past 2 years, artificial intelligence (AI) was used to generate DIR and PSIR from standard clinical sequences (eg, T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequences), but multicenter validation is crucial for further implementation.

Prototype-guided multi-scale domain adaptation for Alzheimer's disease detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and there is no effective treatment currently. Using artificial intelligence technology to assist the diagnosis and intervention as early as possible is of great significance to delay the development of AD. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) has shown great practical values on computer-aided AD diagnosis. Affected by data from different sources or acquisition domains in realistic scenarios, MRI data often suffer from domain shift problem. In this paper, we propose a deep Prototype-Guided Multi-Scale Domain Adaptation (PMDA) framework to handle MRI data with domain shift problem, and realize automatic auxiliary diagnosis of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Cognitively Normal (CN). PMDA is composed of three modules: (1) MRI multi-scale feature extraction module combines the advantages of 3D convolution and self-attention to effectively extract multi-scale features in high-dimensional space, (2) Prototype Maximum Density Divergence (Pro-MDD) module adopts prototype learning to constrain the feature outlier samples in a mini-batch when MDD is used to align source domain and target domain, and (3) Adversarial Domain Adaptation module is applied to achieve global feature alignment of the source domain and target domain and co-training two distinctive discriminators to mitigate the over-fitting issue. Experiments have been performed on 3T and 1.5T sMRI with domain shift in ADNI dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework PMDA outperforms supervised learning methods and several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods and achieves a superior accuracy of 92.11%, 76.01% and 82.37% on AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. CN tasks, respectively.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Domain adaptation; Feature alignment; Multi-scale; Prototype MDD; Structural MRI,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction","Cai, H; Zhang, Q; Long, Y"

Dry Chemistry-Based Bipolar Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay Device for Point-of-Care Testing of Alzheimer-Associated Neuronal Thread Protein.,"In this study, we developed, for the first time, a novel dry chemistry-based bipolar electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay device for point-of-care testing (POCT) of Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP), where the ECL signals were automatically collected and analyzed after the sample and buffer solutions were manually added onto the immunosensor. The proposed immunoassay device contains an automatic ECL analyzer and a dry chemistry-based ECL immunosensor fabricated with a screen-printed fiber material-based chip and a three-dimensional (3D)-printed shell. Each pad of the fiber material-based chip was premodified with certain reagents for immunoreaction and then assembled to form the ECL immunosensor. The self-enhanced ECL of the Ru(II)-poly-l-lysine complex and the lateral flow fiber material-based chip make the addition of coreactants and repeated flushing unnecessary. Only the sample and buffer solutions are added to the ECL immunosensor, and the process of ECL detection can be completed in about 6 min using the proposed automatic ECL analyzer.

Hybridized Deep Learning Approach for Detecting Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is mainly a neurodegenerative sickness. The primary characteristics are neuronal atrophy, amyloid deposition, and cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric disorders. Numerous machine learning (ML) algorithms have been investigated and applied to AD identification over the past decades, emphasizing the subtle prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to assess critical features that distinguish the disease's early manifestation and instruction for early detection and treatment. Identifying early MCI (EMCI) remains challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing patients with cognitive normality from those with MCI. As a result, most classification algorithms for these two groups perform poorly. This paper proposes a hybrid Deep Learning Approach for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. A method for early AD detection using multimodal imaging and Convolutional Neural Network with the Long Short-term memory algorithm combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and standard neuropsychological test scores. The proposed methodology updates the learning weights, and Adam's optimization is used to increase accuracy. The system has an unparalleled accuracy of 98.5% in classifying cognitively normal controls from EMCI. These results imply that deep neural networks may be trained to automatically discover imaging biomarkers indicative of AD and use them to identify the illness accurately.",2023,Adam’s optimization; Alzheimer; convolutional neural network; long short-term memory,,"Balaji, P; Chaurasia, MA; Bilfaqih, SM; Muniasamy, A; Alsid, LEG"

Ensemble feature selection with data-driven thresholding for Alzheimer's disease biomarker discovery.,"Feature selection is often used to identify the important features in a dataset but can produce unstable results when applied to high-dimensional data. The stability of feature selection can be improved with the use of feature selection ensembles, which aggregate the results of multiple base feature selectors. However, a threshold must be applied to the final aggregated feature set to separate the relevant features from the redundant ones. A fixed threshold, which is typically used, offers no guarantee that the final set of selected features contains only relevant features. This work examines a selection of data-driven thresholds to automatically identify the relevant features in an ensemble feature selector and evaluates their predictive accuracy and stability. Ensemble feature selection with data-driven thresholding is applied to two real-world studies of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure, that begins at least 2-3 decades before overt symptoms appear, presenting an opportunity for researchers to identify early biomarkers that might identify patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Data-driven thresholding; Ensemble feature selection; Stability,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Biomarkers; Algorithms; Computational Biology,"Spooner, A; Mohammadi, G; Sachdev, PS; Brodaty, H; Sowmya, A"
Atrophy asymmetry in hippocampal subfields in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,"Volumetric analysis of hippocampal subfields and their asymmetry assessment recently has been useful biomarkers in neuroscience. In this study, hippocampal subfields atrophy and pattern of their asymmetry in the patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were evaluated. MRI images of 20 AD patients, 20 MCI patients, and 20 healthy control (HC) were selected. The volumes of hippocampal subfields were extracted automatically using Freesurfer toolkit. The subfields asymmetry index (AI) and laterality ([Formula: see text]) were also evaluated. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the subfields volume between three patient groups (age and gender as covariates). We used ANOVA (P < 0.05) test for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni's post hoc correction method. Hippocampal subfields volume in AD patients were significantly lower than HC and MCI groups (P < 0.02); however, no significant difference was observed between MCI and HC groups. The asymmetry index (AI) in some subfields was significantly different between AD and MCI, as well as between AD and HC, while there was not any significant difference between MCI groups with HC. In all three patient groups, rightward laterality ([Formula: see text]) was seen in several subfields except subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum, while in AD patient, rightward lateralization slightly decrease. Hippocampal subfields asymmetry can be used as a quantitative biomarker in neurocognitive disorders. In this study, it was observed that the asymmetry index of some subfields in AD is significantly different from MCI. In AD, patient rightward laterality was less MCI an HC group.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Brain asymmetry; Brain atrophy; Brain laterality; Hippocampal subfields; Hippocampus; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuroimaging,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Atrophy,"Jahanshahi, AR; Naghdi Sadeh, R; Khezerloo, D"
Acoustic-Linguistic Features for Modeling Neurological Task Score in Alzheimer's.,"The average life expectancy is increasing globally due to advancements in medical technology, preventive health care, and a growing emphasis on gerontological health. Therefore, developing technologies that detect and track aging-associated disease in cognitive function among older adult populations is imperative. In particular, research related to automatic detection and evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical given the disease's prevalence and the cost of current methods. As AD impacts the acoustics of speech and vocabulary, natural language processing and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. We compare and contrast the performance of ten linear regression models for predicting Mini-Mental Status Exam scores on the ADReSS challenge dataset. We extracted 13000+ handcrafted and learned features that capture linguistic and acoustic phenomena. Using a subset of 54 top features selected by two methods: (1) recursive elimination and (2) correlation scores, we outperform a state-of-the-art baseline for the same task. Upon scoring and evaluating the statistical significance of each of the selected subset of features for each model, we find that, for the given task, handcrafted linguistic features are more significant than acoustic and learned features.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Computational Biology; Speech; Linguistics; Acoustics,"Aryal, SK; Prioleau, H; Burge, L"

Personal Precise Force Field for Intrinsically Disordered and Ordered Proteins Based on Deep Learning.,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are proteins without a fixed three-dimensional (3D) structure under physiological conditions and are associated with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidosis, diabetes, and other diseases. Experimental methods can hardly capture the ensemble of diverse conformations for IDPs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can sample continuous conformations that might provide a valuable complement to experimental data. However, the accuracy of MD simulations depends on the quality of force field. In particular, the evolutionary conservation and coevolution of IDPs introduce that current force fields could not precisely reproduce the conformation of IDPs. In order to improve the performance of force field, deep learning and reweighting methods were used to automatically generate personal force field parameters for intrinsically disordered and ordered proteins. At first, the deep learning method predicted more accuracy φ/ψ dihedral of residue than the previous method. Then, reweighting optimized the personal force field parameters for each residue. Finally, typical representative systems such as IDPs, structure protein, and fast-folding protein were used to evaluate this force field. The results indicate that two personal force field parameters (named PPFF1 and PPFF1_af2) could better reproduce the experimental observables than ff03CMAP force field. In summary, this strategy will provide feasibility for the development of precise personal force fields.",2023,,Humans; Deep Learning; Protein Folding; Intrinsically Disordered Proteins; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Alzheimer Disease; Protein Conformation,"Ji, X; Liu, H; Zhang, Y; Chen, J; Chen, HF"
Exploiting task relationships for Alzheimer's disease cognitive score prediction via multi-task learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly prevalent and a significant cause of dementia and death in elderly individuals.

Hypergraph Structural Information Aggregation Generative Adversarial Networks for Diagnosis and Pathogenetic Factors Identification of Alzheimer's Disease With Imaging Genetic Data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with profound pathogenetic causes. Imaging genetic data analysis can provide comprehensive insights into its causes. To fully utilize the multi-level information in the data, this article proposes a hypergraph structural information aggregation model, and constructs a novel deep learning method named hypergraph structural information aggregation generative adversarial networks (HSIA-GANs) for the automatic sample classification and accurate feature extraction. Specifically, HSIA-GAN is composed of generator and discriminator. The generator has three main functions. First, vertex graph and edge graph are constructed based on the input hypergraph to present the low-order relations. Second, the low-order structural information of hypergraph is extracted by the designed vertex convolution layers and edge convolution layers. Finally, the synthetic hypergraph is generated as the input of the discriminator. The discriminator can extract the high-order structural information directly from hypergraph through vertex-edge convolution, fuse the high and low-order structural information, and finalize the results through the full connection (FC) layers. Based on the data acquired from AD neuroimaging initiative, HSIA-GAN shows significant advantages in three classification tasks, and extracts discriminant features conducive to better disease classification.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Deep Learning; Algorithms; Neuroimaging","Bi, XA; Wang, Y; Luo, S; Chen, K; Xing, Z; Xu, L"
"Functional magnetic resonance imaging, deep learning, and Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently diagnosed using a mixture of psychological tests and clinical observations. However, these diagnoses are not perfect, and additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help improve our understanding of AD as well as our ability to detect the disease. Accordingly, a large amount of research has been invested into innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a form of neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose AD; however, fMRI is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. Nonetheless, recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human neural networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI research, deep learning models can automatically denoise images and classify AD by detecting patterns in participants' brain scans. In this systematic review, we investigate how fMRI (specifically resting-state fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose AD. In turn, we outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the accuracy, strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep learning methods. In turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new researchers, suggest specific areas for future research, and highlight the potential of fMRI to aid AD diagnoses.",2023,Alzheimer's disease (AD); computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD); deep learning; deep neural networks (DNN); functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Deep Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain,"Warren, SL; Moustafa, AA"

A fusion learning method to subgroup analysis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Uncovering the heterogeneity in the disease progression of Alzheimer's is a key factor to disease understanding and treatment development, so that interventions can be tailored to target the subgroups that will benefit most from the treatment, which is an important goal of precision medicine. However, in practice, one top methodological challenge hindering the heterogeneity investigation is that the true subgroup membership of each individual is often unknown. In this article, we aim to identify latent subgroups of individuals who share a common disorder progress over time, to predict latent subgroup memberships, and to estimate and infer the heterogeneous trajectories among the subgroups. To achieve these goals, we apply a concave fusion learning method to conduct subgroup analysis for longitudinal trajectories of the Alzheimer's disease data. The heterogeneous trajectories are represented by subject-specific unknown functions which are approximated by B-splines. The concave fusion method can simultaneously estimate the spline coefficients and merge them together for the subjects belonging to the same subgroup to automatically identify subgroups and recover the heterogeneous trajectories. The resulting estimator of the disease trajectory of each subgroup is supported by an asymptotic distribution. It provides a sound theoretical basis for further conducting statistical inference in subgroup analysis.",2023,B-spline; concave penalty; heterogeneity; longitudinal trajectory; precision medicine; subgroup analysis,,"Liu, M; Yang, J; Liu, Y; Jia, B; Chen, YF; Sun, L; Ma, S"
Orienting to fear under transient focal disruption of the human amygdala.,"Responding to threat is under strong survival pressure, promoting the evolution of systems highly optimized for the task. Though the amygdala is implicated in 'detecting' threat, its role in the action that immediately follows-'orienting'-remains unclear. Critical to mounting a targeted response, such early action requires speed, accuracy, and resilience optimally achieved through conserved, parsimonious, dedicated systems, insured against neural loss by a parallelized functional organization. These characteristics tend to conceal the underlying substrate not only from correlative methods but also from focal disruption over time scales long enough for compensatory adaptation to take place. In a study of six patients with intracranial electrodes temporarily implanted for the clinical evaluation of focal epilepsy, we investigated gaze orienting to fear during focal, transient, unilateral direct electrical disruption of the amygdala. We showed that the amygdala is necessary for rapid gaze shifts towards faces presented in the contralateral hemifield regardless of their emotional expression, establishing its functional lateralization. Behaviourally dissociating the location of presented fear from the direction of the response, we implicated the amygdala not only in detecting contralateral faces, but also in automatically orienting specifically towards fearful ones. This salience-specific role was demonstrated within a drift-diffusion model of action to manifest as an orientation bias towards the location of potential threat. Pixel-wise analysis of target facial morphology revealed scleral exposure as its primary driver, and induced gamma oscillations-obtained from intracranial local field potentials-as its time-locked electrophysiological correlate. The amygdala is here reconceptualized as a functionally lateralized instrument of early action, reconciling previous conflicting accounts confined to detection, and revealing a neural organisation analogous to the superior colliculus, with which it is phylogenetically kin. Greater clarity on its role has the potential to guide therapeutic resection, still frequently complicated by impairments of cognition and behaviour related to threat, and inform novel focal stimulation techniques for the management of neuropsychiatric conditions.",2023,amygdala; drift-diffusion; electrical stimulation; fear; gamma oscillations,Humans; Fear; Amygdala; Cognition; Facial Expression; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Photic Stimulation,"Jha, A; Diehl, B; Strange, B; Miserocchi, A; Chowdhury, F; McEvoy, AW; Nachev, P"
