The Value of a Virtual Assistant to Improve Engagement in Computerized Cognitive Training at Home: Exploratory Study.,"Impaired cognitive function is observed in many pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. At present, the pharmaceutical treatments available to counter cognitive decline have only modest effects, with significant side effects. A nonpharmacological treatment that has received considerable attention is computerized cognitive training (CCT), which aims to maintain or improve cognitive functioning through repeated practice in standardized exercises. CCT allows for more regular and thorough training of cognitive functions directly at home, which represents a significant opportunity to prevent and fight cognitive decline. However, the presence of assistance during training seems to be an important parameter to improve patients' motivation and adherence to treatment. To compensate for the absence of a therapist during at-home CCT, a relevant option could be to include a virtual assistant to accompany patients throughout their training.",2024,Alzheimer disease; THERADIA; artificial intelligence; cognitive decline; cognitive disorders; cognitive training; conversational agent; digital therapies; mild cognitive impairment; social interaction; virtual health assistant,,"Zsoldos, I; Trân, E; Fournier, H; Tarpin-Bernard, F; Fruitet, J; Fouillen, M; Bailly, G; Elisei, F; Bouchot, B; Constant, P; Ringeval, F; Koenig, O; Chainay, H"
Cognitive Assessment with Cognivue Clarity®: Psychometric Properties and Normative Ranges in a Diverse Population.,Detecting cognitive impairment in clinical practice is challenging as most instruments do not perform well in diverse samples of older adults. These same instruments are often used for eligibility into clinical trials making it difficult to recruit minoritized adults into Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies.

A Novel Computerized Cognitive Test for the Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Its Association with Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Prone Brain Regions.,"During the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative changes can be identified by measuring volumetric loss in AD-prone brain regions on MRI. Cognitive assessments that are sensitive enough to measure the early brain-behavior manifestations of AD and that correlate with biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to identify and monitor individuals at risk for dementia. Weak sensitivity to early cognitive change has been a major limitation of traditional cognitive assessments. In this study, we focused on expanding our previous work by determining whether a digitized cognitive stress test, the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning, Brief Computerized Version (LASSI-BC) could differentiate between Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) groups. A second focus was to correlate LASSI-BC performance to volumetric reductions in AD-prone brain regions. Data was gathered from 111 older adults who were comprehensively evaluated and administered the LASSI-BC. Eighty-seven of these participants (51 CU; 36 aMCI) underwent MR imaging. The volumes of 12 AD-prone brain regions were related to LASSI-BC and other memory tests correcting for False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results indicated that, even after adjusting for initial learning ability, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) on the LASSI-BC differentiated between CU and aMCI groups. An optimal combination of frPSI and initial learning strength on the LASSI-BC yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.876 (76.1% sensitivity, 82.7% specificity). Further, frPSI on the LASSI-BC was associated with volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and posterior cingulate.",2023,Cortical Thickness; LASSI-L; MRI Volume; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Proactive Semantic Interference,,"Curiel Cid, RE; Zheng, DD; Kitaigorodsky, M; Adjouadi, M; Crocco, EA; Georgiou, M; Gonzalez-Jimenez, C; Ortega, A; Goryawala, M; Nagornaya, N; Pattany, P; Sfakianaki, E; Visser, U; Loewenstein, DA"
Plant-derived bioactive compounds and their novel role in central nervous system disorder treatment via ATF4 targeting: A systematic literature review.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders exhibit exceedingly intricate pathogenic mechanisms. Pragmatic and effective solutions remain elusive, significantly compromising human life and health. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) participates in the regulation of multiple pathophysiological processes, including CNS disorders. Considering the widespread involvement of ATF4 in the pathological process of CNS disorders, the targeted regulation of ATF4 by plant-derived bioactive compounds (PDBCs) may become a viable strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders. However, the regulatory relationship between PDBCs and ATF4 remains incompletely understood. Here, we aimed to comprehensively review the studies on PDBCs targeting ATF4 to ameliorate CNS disorders, thereby offering novel directions and insights for the treatment of CNS disorders. A computerized search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases to identify preclinical experiments related to PDBCs targeting ATF4 for the treatment of CNS disorders. The search timeframe was from the inception of the databases to December 2023. Two assessors conducted searches using the keywords ""ATF4,"" ""Central Nervous System,"" ""Neurological,"" ""Alzheimer's disease,"" ""Parkinson's Disease,"" ""Stroke,"" ""Spinal Cord Injury,"" ""Glioblastoma,"" ""Traumatic Brain Injury,"" and ""Spinal Cord Injury."" Overall, 31 studies were included, encompassing assessments of 27 PDBCs. Combining results from in vivo and in vitro studies, we observed that these PDBCs, via ATF4 modulation, prevent the deposition of amyloid-like fibers such as Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein. They regulate ERS, reduce the release of inflammatory factors, restore mitochondrial membrane integrity to prevent oxidative stress, regulate synaptic plasticity, modulate autophagy, and engage anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Consequently, they exert neuroprotective effects in CNS disorders. Numerous PDBCs targeting ATF4 have shown potential in facilitating the restoration of CNS functionality, thereby presenting expansive prospects for the treatment of such disorders. However, future endeavors necessitate high-quality, large-scale, and comprehensive preclinical and clinical studies to further validate this therapeutic potential.",2024,ATF4; CNS disorders; neuroprotection; plant-derived bioactive compounds; systematic review,Activating Transcription Factor 4; Humans; Central Nervous System Diseases; Animals; Phytochemicals; Neuroprotective Agents,"Zhang, N; Zhang, S; Dong, X"
Computerized decision support is an effective approach to select memory clinic patients for amyloid-PET.,"The use of amyloid-PET in dementia workup is upcoming. At the same time, amyloid-PET is costly and limitedly available. While the appropriate use criteria (AUC) aim for optimal use of amyloid-PET, their limited sensitivity hinders the translation to clinical practice. Therefore, there is a need for tools that guide selection of patients for whom amyloid-PET has the most clinical utility.

Prediction of Alzheimer's disease stages based on ResNet-Self-attention architecture with Bayesian optimization and best features selection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative illness that impairs cognition, function, and behavior by causing irreversible damage to multiple brain areas, including the hippocampus. The suffering of the patients and their family members will be lessened with an early diagnosis of AD. The automatic diagnosis technique is widely required due to the shortage of medical experts and eases the burden of medical staff. The automatic artificial intelligence (AI)-based computerized method can help experts achieve better diagnosis accuracy and precision rates. This study proposes a new automated framework for AD stage prediction based on the ResNet-Self architecture and Fuzzy Entropy-controlled Path-Finding Algorithm (FEcPFA). A data augmentation technique has been utilized to resolve the dataset imbalance issue. In the next step, we proposed a new deep-learning model based on the self-attention module. A ResNet-50 architecture is modified and connected with a self-attention block for important information extraction. The hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO) and then utilized to train the model, which was subsequently employed for feature extraction. The self-attention extracted features were optimized using the proposed FEcPFA. The best features were selected using FEcPFA and passed to the machine learning classifiers for the final classification. The experimental process utilized a publicly available MRI dataset and achieved an improved accuracy of 99.9%. The results were compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, demonstrating the improvement of the proposed framework in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; MRI; convolutional neural network; deep learning; fuzzy entropy; optimization; self-attention,,"Yaqoob, N; Khan, MA; Masood, S; Albarakati, HM; Hamza, A; Alhayan, F; Jamel, L; Masood, A"

Environmental pesticide exposure and Alzheimer's disease in southern Spain: A cross-sectional study.,"The intensive cultivation under plastic in southern Spain has made the agricultural model highly productive. Although strict regulations on pesticide usage exist, exposure to pesticides in the environment has been associated with an increased appearance of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A cross-sectional study was performed to examine the prevalence and risk of AD related to pesticide exposure in Andalusia (Spain). We utilized the Odds Ratio statistical test to compare the prevalence rate of AD in the exposed and unexposed areas. 40,044 cases were collected from computerized hospital records between 2000 and 2021. Districts with higher pesticide use showed significantly higher prevalence rates and increased risk of developing AD, compared to those with lower pesticide use. These findings provide further evidence supporting an increased risk of AD following environmental exposure to pesticides at the level of the general population.",2024,Alzheimer disease; Cross-sectional study; Environmental chemicals; Pesticides,"Humans; Spain; Cross-Sectional Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Pesticides; Female; Male; Environmental Exposure; Aged; Prevalence; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged","Ruiz-González, C; Román, P; Rueda-Ruzafa, L; Cardona, D; Requena, M; Alarcón, R"

Episodic memory assessment: effects of sex and age on performance and response time during a continuous recognition task.,"Continuous recognition tasks (CRTs) assess episodic memory (EM), the central functional disturbance in Alzheimer's disease and several related disorders. The online MemTrax computerized CRT provides a platform for screening and assessment that is engaging and can be repeated frequently. MemTrax presents complex visual stimuli, which require complex involvement of the lateral and medial temporal lobes and can be completed in less than 2 min. Results include number of correct recognitions (HITs), recognition failures (MISSes = 1-HITs), correct rejections (CRs), false alarms (FAs = 1-CRs), total correct (TC = HITs + CRs), and response times (RTs) for each HIT and FA. Prior analyses of MemTrax CRT data show no effects of sex but an effect of age on performance. The number of HITs corresponds to faster RT-HITs more closely than TC, and CRs do not relate to RT-HITs. RT-HITs show a typical skewed distribution, and cumulative RT-HITs fit a negative survival curve (RevEx). Thus, this study aimed to define precisely the effects of sex and age on HITS, CRs, RT-HITs, and the dynamics of RTs in an engaged population.",2024,cognitive assessment; dementia; episodic memory; memory; response time,,"Clifford, JO; Anand, S; Tarpin-Bernard, F; Bergeron, MF; Ashford, CB; Bayley, PJ; Ashford, JW"
Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD. Our new smartphone test, TapTalk, combines analysis of hand and speech-like movements to detect AD risk. This study aims to [1] determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately predict preclinical AD [2], determine usability, reliability, and validity of TapTalk in cognitively asymptomatic older adults and [3], prospectively validate TapTalk in older adults who have cognitive symptoms against cognitive tests and clinical diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Dementia; Diadochokinesis; Digital biomarker; Finger-tapping; Kinematics; Multimodal; TAS Test; TapTalk,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Alty, J; Goldberg, LR; Roccati, E; Lawler, K; Bai, Q; Huang, G; Bindoff, AD; Li, R; Wang, X; St George, RJ; Rudd, K; Bartlett, L; Collins, JM; Aiyede, M; Fernando, N; Bhagwat, A; Giffard, J; Salmon, K; McDonald, S; King, AE; Vickers, JC"
Non-invasive neuromodulation of cerebello-hippocampal volume-behavior relationships.,"The study here explores the link between transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and brain-behavior relationships. We propose that tDCS may indirectly influence the complex relationships between brain volume and behavior. We focused on the dynamics between the hippocampus (HPC) and cerebellum (CB) in cognitive processes, a relationship with significant implications for understanding memory and motor skills. Seventy-four young adults (mean age: 22±0.42 years, mean education: 14.7±0.25 years) were randomly assigned to receive either anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation. Following stimulation, participants completed computerized tasks assessing working memory and sequence learning in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment. We investigated the statistical interaction between CB and HPC volumes. Our findings showed that individuals with larger cerebellar volumes had shorter reaction times (RT) on a high-load working memory task in the sham stimulation group. In contrast, the anodal stimulation group exhibited faster RTs during the low-load working memory condition. These RT differences were associated with the cortical volumetric interaction between CB-HPC. Literature suggests that anodal stimulation down-regulates the CB and here, those with larger volumes perform more quickly, suggesting the potential need for additional cognitive resources to compensate for cerebellar downregulation. This new insight suggests that tDCS can aid in revealing structure-function relationships, due to greater performance variability, especially in young adults. It may also reveal new targets of interest in the study of aging or in diseases where there is also greater behavioral variability.",2024,brain-behavior; cerebellum; cognitive process; cortical volumetric interaction; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),,"Magalhães, TNC; Maldonado, T; Jackson, TB; Hicks, TH; Herrejon, IA; Rezende, TJR; Symm, AC; Bernard, JA"
Recent Advances in the Treatment and Management of Alzheimer's Disease: A Precision Medicine Perspective.,"About 60% to 70% of people with dementia have Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a neuro-degenerative illness. One reason for this disorder is the misfolding of naturally occurring proteins in the human brain, specifically β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. Certain diagnostic imaging techniques, such as amyloid PET imaging, tau PET imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Comput-erized Tomography (CT), and others, can detect biomarkers in blood, plasma, and cerebral spinal fluids, like an increased level of β-amyloid, plaques, and tangles. In order to create new pharma-cotherapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, researchers must have a thorough and detailed knowledge of amyloid beta misfolding and other related aspects. Dolopezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are among the medications now used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Another medication that can temporarily alleviate dementia symptoms is memantine, which blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. However, it is not able to halt or re-verse the progression of the disease. Medication now on the market can only halt its advance-ment, not reverse it. Interventions to alleviate behavioral and psychological symptoms, exhibit an-ti-neuroinflammation and anti-tau effects, induce neurotransmitter alteration and cognitive en-hancement, and provide other targets have recently been developed. For some Alzheimer's pa-tients, the FDA-approved monoclonal antibody, aducanumab, is an option; for others, phase 3 clinical studies are underway for drugs, like lecanemab and donanemab, which have demonstrat-ed potential in eliminating amyloid protein. However, additional study is required to identify and address these limitations in order to reduce the likelihood of side effects and maximize the thera-peutic efficacy.",2024,Alzheimer's disease anti-tau; Clinical trials; anti-amyloid; neuroprotection; precision medicine.; tautopathy,,"Shukla, D; Suryavanshi, A; Bharti, SK; Asati, V; Mahapatra, DK"

Changes in BDNF methylation patterns after cognitive remediation therapy in schizophrenia: A randomized and controlled trial.,"Although cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) produces cognitive benefits in schizophrenia, we do not yet understand whether molecular changes are associated with this cognitive improvement. A gene central to synaptic plasticity, the BDNF, has been proposed as one potential route. This study assesses whether BDNF methylation changes following CRT-produced cognitive improvement are detected. A randomized and controlled trial was performed with two groups (CRT, n = 40; TAU: Treatment as Usual, n = 20) on a sample of participants with schizophrenia. CRT was delivered by trained therapists using a web-based computerized program. Mixed Models, where the interaction of treatment (CRT, TAU) by time (T0: 0 weeks, T1: 16 weeks) was the main effect were used. Then, we tested the association between the treatment and methylation changes in three CpG islands of the BDNF gene. CRT group showed significant improvements in some cognitive domains. Between-groups differential changes in 5 CpG units over time were found, 4 in island 1 (CpG1.2, CpG1.7, CpG1.10, CpG1.17) and 1 in island 3 (CpG3.2). CRT group showed increases in methylation in CpG1.2, CpG1.7 and decreases in pG1.10, CpG1.17, and CpG3.2. Differences in the degree of methylation were associated with changes in Speed of Processing, Working Memory, and Verbal Learning within the CRT group. Those findings provide new data on the relationship between cognitive improvement and changes in peripheral methylation levels of BDNF gene, a key factor involved in neuroplasticity regulation.

"Cholinergic changes in Lewy body disease: implications for presentation, progression and subtypes.","Cholinergic degeneration is significant in Lewy body disease, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder. Extensive research has demonstrated cholinergic alterations in the CNS of these disorders. More recently, studies have revealed cholinergic denervation in organs that receive parasympathetic denervation. This enables a comprehensive review of cholinergic changes in Lewy body disease, encompassing both central and peripheral regions, various disease stages and diagnostic categories. Across studies, brain regions affected in Lewy body dementia show equal or greater levels of cholinergic impairment compared to the brain regions affected in Lewy body disease without dementia. This observation suggests a continuum of cholinergic alterations between these disorders. Patients without dementia exhibit relative sparing of limbic regions, whereas occipital and superior temporal regions appear to be affected to a similar extent in patients with and without dementia. This implies that posterior cholinergic cell groups in the basal forebrain are affected in the early stages of Lewy body disorders, while more anterior regions are typically affected later in the disease progression. The topographical changes observed in patients affected by comorbid Alzheimer pathology may reflect a combination of changes seen in pure forms of Lewy body disease and those seen in Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that Alzheimer co-pathology is important to understand cholinergic degeneration in Lewy body disease. Thalamic cholinergic innervation is more affected in Lewy body patients with dementia compared to those without dementia, and this may contribute to the distinct clinical presentations observed in these groups. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, the thalamus is variably affected, suggesting a different sequential involvement of cholinergic cell groups in Alzheimer's disease compared to Lewy body disease. Patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder demonstrate cholinergic denervation in abdominal organs that receive parasympathetic innervation from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, similar to patients who experienced this sleep disorder in their prodrome. This implies that REM sleep behaviour disorder is important for understanding peripheral cholinergic changes in both prodromal and manifest phases of Lewy body disease. In conclusion, cholinergic changes in Lewy body disease carry implications for understanding phenotypes and the influence of Alzheimer co-pathology, delineating subtypes and pathological spreading routes, and for developing tailored treatments targeting the cholinergic system.",2024,VAChT proteins; acetylcholinesterase; cholinergic neurons; positron emission tomography; single-photon emission computerized tomography,Lewy Body Disease; Humans; Disease Progression; Cholinergic Neurons; Brain; Alzheimer Disease,"Okkels, N; Grothe, MJ; Taylor, JP; Hasselbalch, SG; Fedorova, TD; Knudsen, K; van der Zee, S; van Laar, T; Bohnen, NI; Borghammer, P; Horsager, J"

The MAPP Room Memory Test: Examining Contextual Memory Using a Novel Computerized Test in Cognitively-Unimpaired Individuals with Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease.,"Contextual memory, the ability to remember spatial or temporal features related to an event, is affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a shortfall of tests that measure contextual memory. To evaluate visuospatial contextual memory, we developed a computerized cognitive test, the MAPP Room Memory Test, which requires participants to identify in which visual scene target items were previously presented. We hypothesized that cognitively-unimpaired carriers of an autosomal dominant AD mutation (Presenilin-1 E280A, n=15) would perform more poorly on this test than non-carrier family members (n=31). Compared to non-carriers, the carriers had significantly worse delayed room recognition. The results indicate that the MAPP Room Memory Test may be sensitive to subtle cognitive changes associated with risk of AD. Future studies with larger samples using the MAPP Room Memory Test and biomarkers are needed to examine whether this test may also be sensitive to the earliest pathological changes in preclinical AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cognition; contextual memory; neuropsychology,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Mutation; Neuropsychological Tests,"Giudicessi, A; Aduen, PA; Fox-Fuller, JT; Martinez, JE; Gonzalez, LA; Vila-Castelar, C; Baena, A; Pluim McDowell, C; Cronin-Golomb, A; Lopera, F; Quiroz, YT"

Current trends in psychotherapies and psychosocial interventions for people with dementia: a scoping review of randomized controlled trials.,"An outcome of dementia is a progressive decline in cognitive function. Implementing psychotherapies and psychosocial interventions is crucial for bolstering cognitive abilities, promoting independence, and elevating the quality of life for individuals with dementia. This review aims to identify current trends in psychotherapies and psychosocial interventions for people with dementia. A Scoping review was developed based on the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. The literature search was conducted on electronic databases, including Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Nursing & Allied Health Collection, and MedicLatina. Executed in June 2023, the search focused on articles published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish between 2013 and 2023. Through this search, 1409 articles were initially identified. After selecting and analyzing the reports, sixteen trials were included in this review. Eight distinct categories were identified, covering different strategies. These categories run from computerized game-based cognitive training and reminiscence therapy to compensatory and restorative strategies, memory and attention training, calculation training, dual-task training, counseling, and personalized goal attainment.

Intelligent digital tools for screening of brain connectivity and dementia risk estimation in people affected by mild cognitive impairment: the AI-Mind clinical study protocol.,"More than 10 million Europeans show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal brain aging and dementia stage memory disorder. The path MCI takes can be divergent; while some maintain stability or even revert to cognitive norms, alarmingly, up to half of the cases progress to dementia within 5 years. Current diagnostic practice lacks the necessary screening tools to identify those at risk of progression. The European patient experience often involves a long journey from the initial signs of MCI to the eventual diagnosis of dementia. The trajectory is far from ideal. Here, we introduce the AI-Mind project, a pioneering initiative with an innovative approach to early risk assessment through the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) on multimodal data. The cutting-edge AI-based tools developed in the project aim not only to accelerate the diagnostic process but also to deliver highly accurate predictions regarding an individual's risk of developing dementia when prevention and intervention may still be possible. AI-Mind is a European Research and Innovation Action (RIA H2020-SC1-BHC-06-2020, No. 964220) financed between 2021 and 2026.

Sex differences in the association of sleep spindle density and cognitive performance among community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with obstructive sleep apnea.,"Recent studies have found associations between obstructive sleep apnea and cognitive decline. The underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigate the associations between changes in micro-architecture, specifically sleep spindles, and cognitive function in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults, some with obstructive sleep apnea, with a focus on sex differences. A total of 125 voluntary participants (mean age 66.0 ± 6.4 years, 64 females) from a larger cohort (participants of the Brain in Motion Studies I and II) underwent 1 night of in-home polysomnography and a neuropsychological battery (sleep and cognitive testing were conducted within 2 weeks of each other). A semi-automatic computerized algorithm was used to score polysomnography data and detect spindle characteristics in non-rapid eye movement Stages 2 and 3 in both frontal and central electrodes. Based on their apnea-hypopnea index, participants were divided into those with no obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index < 5 per hr, n = 21), mild obstructive sleep apnea (5 ≥ apnea-hypopnea index < 15, n = 47), moderate obstructive sleep apnea (15 ≥ apnea-hypopnea index < 30, n = 34) and severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 30, n = 23). There were no significant differences in spindle characteristics between the four obstructive sleep apnea severity groups. Spindle density and percentage of fast spindles were positively associated with some verbal fluency measures on the cognitive testing. Sex might be linked with these associations. Biological sex could play a role in the associations between spindle characteristics and some verbal fluency measures. Obstructive sleep apnea severity was not found to be a contributing factor in this non-clinical community-dwelling cohort.",2024,aging; cognition; community‐dwelling; obstructive sleep apnea; older adults; polysomnography; sleep; sleep apnea; spindles,"Humans; Male; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Female; Aged; Polysomnography; Middle Aged; Cognition; Neuropsychological Tests; Electroencephalography; Sleep; Sleep Stages; Sex Factors; Independent Living; Cohort Studies; Sex Characteristics","Pun, M; Guadagni, V; Longman, RS; Hanly, PJ; Hill, MD; Anderson, TJ; Hogan, DB; Rawling, JM; Poulin, M"
Interleukin 10 (IL10) promoter region polymorphism is associated with IL10 serum concentrations and processing speed in healthy community-dwelling older adults.,"Inflammation is repressed by interleukin 10 (IL10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, and unchecked inflammation can have detrimental effects on cognition. In healthy older adults enrolled in the Australian Research Council Longevity Intervention (ARCLI) cohort we explored whether a known functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of IL10, -1082 G/A (rs1800896), was associated with reaction times on computerized cognitive testing that included elements of processing speed (i.e., reaction time). Participants were aged 60-75 years (240 females, 158 males), free of dementia and psychiatric disorders, and provide a blood sample. Processing speed was measured using the Swinburne University Computerized Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB), which includes measures of reaction time (in milliseconds, ms) on six tasks. Blood-derived DNA was genotyped for the IL10 rs1800896 SNP and presence of the APOE E4 allele. General linear models for each SUCCAB subtest were fitted, with age, sex, education (years), APOE E4 carrier status, and IL10 genotype as independent variables. Carriers of the IL10 AA genotype had significantly slower reaction times on multiple tests compared to carriers of the minor allele (AG, GG) and lower IL10 serum levels. Although IL10 SNPs have not been detected in Alzheimer's disease genome-wide associated studies, these results support further exploration of IL10 mechanisms as a possible resilience factor.",2024,,"Male; Female; Humans; Aged; Interleukin-10; Processing Speed; Independent Living; Australia; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genotype; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Inflammation; Apolipoproteins E; Genetic Predisposition to Disease","Keegan, AP; Savage, K; Bousman, CA; Nolidin, K; Cribb, L; Pipingas, A; Stough, C"
Examining the diagnostic value of the mnemonic discrimination task for classification of cognitive status and amyloid-beta burden.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, characterized by early memory impairments and gradual worsening of daily functions. AD-related pathology, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, begins to accumulate many years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Predicting risk for AD via related pathology is critical as the preclinical stage could serve as a therapeutic time window, allowing for early management of the disease and reducing health and economic costs. Current methods for detecting AD pathology, however, are often expensive and invasive, limiting wide and easy access to a clinical setting. A non-invasive, cost-efficient platform, such as computerized cognitive tests, could be potentially useful to identify at-risk individuals as early as possible. In this study, we examined the diagnostic value of an episodic memory task, the mnemonic discrimination task (MDT), for predicting risk of cognitive impairment or Aβ burden. We constructed a random forest classification algorithm, utilizing MDT performance metrics and various neuropsychological test scores as input features, and assessed model performance using area under the curve (AUC). Models based on MDT performance metrics achieved classification results with an AUC of 0.83 for cognitive status and an AUC of 0.64 for Aβ status. Our findings suggest that mnemonic discrimination function may be a useful predictor of progression to prodromal AD or increased risk of Aβ load, which could be a cost-efficient, noninvasive cognitive testing solution for potentially wide-scale assessment of AD pathological and cognitive risk.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-beta pathology; Mild cognitive impairment; Mnemonic discrimination tasks; Pattern separation; Random forest classification,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Episodic; Positron-Emission Tomography","Kim, S; Adams, JN; Chappel-Farley, MG; Keator, D; Janecek, J; Taylor, L; Mikhail, A; Hollearn, M; McMillan, L; Rapp, P; Yassa, MA"

Dynamic Reconfiguration of Dominant Intrinsic Coupling Modes in Elderly at Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease Risk.,"Large-scale human brain networks interact across both spatial and temporal scales. Especially for electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), there are many evidences that there is a synergy of different subnetworks that oscillate on a dominant frequency within a quasi-stable brain temporal frame. Intrinsic cortical-level integration reflects the reorganization of functional brain networks that support a compensation mechanism for cognitive decline. Here, a computerized intervention integrating different functions of the medial temporal lobes, namely, object-level and scene-level representations, was conducted. One hundred fifty-eight patients with mild cognitive impairment underwent 90 min of training per day over 10 weeks. An active control (AC) group of 50 subjects was exposed to documentaries, and a passive control group of 55 subjects did not engage in any activity. Following a dynamic functional source connectivity analysis, the dynamic reconfiguration of intra- and cross-frequency coupling mechanisms before and after the intervention was revealed. After the neuropsychological and resting state electroencephalography evaluation, the ratio of inter versus intra-frequency coupling modes and also the contribution of β1 frequency was higher for the target group compared to its pre-intervention period. These frequency-dependent contributions were linked to neuropsychological estimates that were improved due to intervention. Additionally, the time-delays of the cortical interactions were improved in {δ, θ, α2, β1} compared to the pre-intervention period. Finally, dynamic networks of the target group further improved their efficiency over the total cost of the network. This is the first study that revealed a dynamic reconfiguration of intrinsic coupling modes and an improvement of time-delays due to a target intervention protocol.",2023,Cross-frequency coupling; Dynamic functional connectivity analysis; Elderly; Electroencephalography; Intervention; Intrinsic coupling modes; Multiplexity; Time-delays,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Magnetoencephalography; Electroencephalography; Brain Mapping,"Exarchos, TP; Whelan, R; Tarnanas, I"
Construct validation of NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery premorbid cognitive functioning scores in Black and White older Americans with and without mild cognitive impairment.,"Valid estimates of premorbid cognitive functioning (PMIQ) are crucial for the assessment of older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the relationship between the NIH Toolbox-Cognition Battery's (NIHTB-CB) Oral Reading Recognition (ORR) subtest and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading scores (WTAR, convergent validity). We also compared ORR to NIHTB-CB Flanker scores, where null relationships were expected (discriminant validity).",2024,Convergent; MCI; assessment; computerized; discriminant; validity,"Aged; Humans; Bayes Theorem; Black or African American; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; White; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over","Halter, CM; Moll, AC; Kero, K; Kavcic, V; Woodard, JL; Giordani, B"
Investigating the relationship between periodontitis and specific memory processes in the search for cognitive markers of Alzheimer's disease risk.,"The spontaneous retrieval deficit (SRD) hypothesis argues that individuals in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are particularly impaired in spontaneous retrieval, which manifests in reduced mind-wandering. Our main purpose was to provide novel evidence to support the SRD hypothesis by investigating, for the first time, the relationship between mind-wandering and periodontitis, the latter being the risk factor for AD. The second objective was to address the lack of deeper understanding of the relationship between oral health and specific cognitive abilities by investigating whether periodontitis would be primarily associated with memory. Sixty community-dwelling dementia-free older adults completed neuropsychological tests that focused on various cognitive abilities and a computerised task, during which mind-wandering was evaluated. Periodontal health was assessed subjectively, and through an oral examination by a qualified dentist that focused on visible periodontitis-related changes in gingival tissues and the number of periodontitis bacteria. In line with our predictions, objective and subjective symptoms of poorer periodontal health were associated with less mind-wandering, providing further support for the SRD hypothesis. Again in line with predictions, poorer periodontal health was associated with worse episodic memory, with no relationship between periodontitis and the measure targeting various cognitive abilities, from which memory was excluded.",2023,,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Periodontitis; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory, Episodic","Wereszczyński, M; Śmigiel, A; Tomaszewska, I; Niedźwieńska, A"

Suggestions on the ideal method of conducting community screenings for older adults.,"Since dementia and frailty lead to a reduced quality of life and risk of needing long-term care in the older adults, we hypothesized that evaluations related to dementia and frailty would be useful and of high interest in screening for the older adults. Therefore, we conducted a community screening incorporating multiple simple evaluations related to dementia and frailty. In addition to various functional evaluations, we investigated interest in tests, thoughts on the disease, and the relationships between subjective (i.e., how one feels about oneself) and objective evaluations (i.e., the results of tests and rating scales). The purpose of this study was to examine the thoughts regarding tests and diseases and the functions that make it difficult to accurately perceive changes by oneself, and to obtain suggestions on the ideal method of community screening for the older adults.",2023,Cognitive function; Dementia; Frailty; Nutritional status; Olfactory function; Physical function; Screening,Humans; Aged; Frailty; Quality of Life; Cognition; Emotions; Dementia,"Kouzuki, M; Tanaka, N; Miyamoto, M; Urakami, K"

Augmented pain-evoked primary sensorimotor cortex activation in adolescent girls with juvenile fibromyalgia.,"Juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM) is a chronic widespread pain condition that primarily affects adolescent girls. Previous studies have found increased sensitivity to noxious pressure in adolescents with JFM. However, the underlying changes in brain systems remain unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize pain-evoked brain responses and identify brain mediators of pain hypersensitivity in adolescent girls with JFM. Thirty-three adolescent girls with JFM and 33 healthy adolescent girls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans involving noxious pressure applied to the left thumbnail at an intensity of 2.5 or 4 kg/cm 2 and rated pain intensity and unpleasantness on a computerized Visual Analogue Scale. We conducted standard general linear model analyses and exploratory whole-brain mediation analyses. The JFM group reported significantly greater pain intensity and unpleasantness than the control group in response to noxious pressure stimuli at both intensities ( P < 0.05). The JFM group showed augmented right primary somatosensory cortex (S1) activation to 4 kg/cm 2 (Z > 3.1, cluster-corrected P < 0.05), and the peak S1 activation magnitudes significantly correlated with the scores on the Widespread Pain Index ( r = 0.35, P = 0.048) with higher activation associated with more widespread pain. We also found that greater primary sensorimotor cortex activation in response to 4 kg/cm 2 mediated the between-group differences in pain intensity ratings ( P < 0.001). In conclusion, we found heightened sensitivity to noxious pressure stimuli and augmented pain-evoked sensorimotor cortex responses in adolescent girls with JFM, which could reflect central sensitization or amplified nociceptive input.",2023,,Female; Humans; Adolescent; Fibromyalgia; Chronic Pain; Pain Measurement; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Sensorimotor Cortex,"Tong, H; Maloney, TC; Payne, MF; Suñol, M; Dudley, JA; King, CD; Ting, TV; Kashikar-Zuck, S; Coghill, RC; López-Solà, M"
Learning capacity in early-stage Alzheimer's disease: The role of feedback during learning on memory performance.,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a decline in episodic memory and executive functioning, hampering learning ability. Insight into outcome-based learning capacity may be relevant for optimizing the learning potential of these patients. To date, mixed results have been found in studies in which cognitively impaired participants have to learn based on positive and negative outcomes. In this study, we investigated the role of negative and positive feedback on memory performance and participants' ability to adjust their behaviour accordingly in a sample of 23 early-stage AD patients and 23 matched healthy controls. We administered a novel computerized object-location memory task, in which participants were instructed to learn and memorize the locations of different everyday objects following errorless learning (EL) and trial-and-error learning (TEL). A separate probabilistic TEL task was employed in which participants had to learn how to adjust their behaviour based on positive and negative feedback. EL had a beneficial general effect on memory performance for object locations. However, this effect was not larger in early-stage AD patients compared to controls and error frequency during acquisition of object locations was unrelated to later recall performance. No group differences were found on the probabilistic learning task with respect to learning performance over time and based on positive and negative feedback. Although the error monitoring system seems intact in patients with early-stage AD, errors during learning are likely acting as a source of interference causing difficulty in storage or retrieval of object locations.",2024,error monitoring; errorless learning; spatial memory; trial-and-error learning,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Feedback; Learning; Cognition; Mental Recall,"Scheper, I; Brazil, IA; Claassen, JAHR; Bertens, D; Geurts, S; Kessels, RPC"
Clinical Evolution of Tardive Cervical Dystonia from Antecollis to Retrocollis.,"Tardive dystonia occurs after exposure, over months to years, to antipsychotics and other drugs that block dopaminergic receptors. Anterocollis is a rare form of cervical dystonia which is usually disabling for the patient. Here, we present the case of a 61-year-old woman with Alzheimer's dementia diagnosed eight years ago who was previously medicated with antipsychotics. Two years before admission, she was medicated with olanzapine. She presented to the emergency room with a sustained flexion posture of the neck that was difficult to feed. She had a marked and fixed anterocollis and severe akathisia. After the administration of propofol to perform computerized tomography, the abnormal posture disappeared. Subsequently, she was started on biperiden without improvement. One week later, olanzapine was suspended, and she was progressively started on propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and tetrabenazine. Cervical posture improved, but two weeks later, she presented with a left laterocollis, which allowed feeding, and improvement of akathisia. We present a case of tardive dystonia supported by the beginning of dystonia five months after olanzapine administration and improvement after its suspension. The coexistence of degenerative pathology is a risk factor for dystonia, which often persists despite the suspension of the causative agent. Therefore, non-pharmacological treatment and approach with antipsychotics with a better profile of extrapyramidal effects should be preferred in patients with dementia.",2023,alzheimer’s dementia; antipsychotic medication; cervical dystonia; olanzapine side effects; tardive dystonia,,"Costa, O; Varanda, S; Carneiro, G; Rodrigues, AM"

Cognitively unimpaired ADAD carriers had significantly worse MESERO total scores than non-carrier family members, driven by worse performance in semantically-related object sets; group performances did not differ on semantically unrelated object sets. Findings suggest that MESERO performance may be sensitive to subtle cognitive changes associated with AD.

Digital Intervention For The Management Of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial, chronic, neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence and limited therapeutic options, making it a global health crisis. Being the most common cause of dementia, AD erodes the cognitive, functional, and social abilities of the individual and causes escalating medical and psychosocial needs. As yet, this disorder has no cure and current treatment options are palliative in nature. There is an urgent need for novel therapy to address this pressing challenge. Digital therapeutics (Dtx) is one such novel therapy that is gaining popularity globally. Dtx provides evidence based therapeutic interventions driven by internet and software, employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames, apps, sensors, virtual reality aiding in the prevention, management, and treatment of ailments like neurological abnormalities and chronic diseases. Dtx acts as a supportive tool for the optimization of patient care, individualized treatment and improved health outcomes. Dtx uses visual, sound and other non-invasive approaches for instance-consistent therapy, reminiscence therapy, computerised cognitive training, semantic and phonological assistance devices, wearables and computer-assisted rehabilitation environment to find applications in Alzheimer's disease for improving memory, cognition, functional abilities and managing motor symptom. A few of the Dtx-based tools employed in AD include ""Memory Matters"", ""AlzSense"", ""Alzheimer Assistant"", ""smart robotic dog"", ""Immersive virtual reality (iVR)"" and the most current gamma stimulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current trends in digital health in AD and explore the benefits, challenges, and impediments of using Dtx as an adjunctive therapy for the management of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Dementia; Digital health.; Internet of things; Mobile apps; Reminiscence therapy,,"Manchanda, N; Aggarwal, A; Setya, S; Talegaonkar, S"

Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied in dementia research, including machine learning and deep learning methods for dementia diagnosis and progression detection. Computerized apps are also convenient tools for patients and caregivers to monitor cognitive function changes. Furthermore, social robots can potentially provide daily life support or guidance for the elderly who live alone. This review aims to provide an overview of AI applications in dementia research. We divided the applications into three categories according to different stages of cognitive impairment: (1) cognitive screening and training, (2) diagnosis and prognosis for dementia, and (3) dementia care and interventions. There are numerous studies on AI applications for dementia research. However, one challenge that remains is comparing the effectiveness of different AI methods in real clinical settings.",2023,AI; cognition; deep learning; dementia; machine learning,,"Tsoi, KKF; Jia, P; Dowling, NM; Titiner, JR; Wagner, M; Capuano, AW; Donohue, MC"

Pre-frail older adults show improved cognition with StayFitLonger computerized home-based training: a randomized controlled trial.,"Multidomain interventions have shown tremendous potential for improving cognition in older adults. It is unclear if multidomain interventions can be delivered remotely and whether remote intervention is beneficial for older adults who are vulnerable or at risk of cognitive decline. In a 26-week multi-site, home-based, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 120 cognitively healthy older adults (75 robust, 45 pre-frail; age range = 60-94) recruited from Switzerland, Canada, and Belgium were randomized to receive either the StayFitLonger (SFL) computerized multidomain training program or an active control intervention. Delivered on tablets, the SFL intervention combined adapted physical exercises (strength, balance, and mobility), cognitive training (divided attention, problem solving, and memory), opportunities for social and contributive interactions, and psychoeducation. The active control intervention provided basic mobilization exercises and access to video games. Cognitive outcomes were global cognition (Z-scores of attention, verbal fluency, and episodic memory for nondemented older adults; ZAVEN), memory, executive function, and processing speed. Linear mixed model analyses indicated improved performance on the ZAVEN global cognition score in the SFL group but not in the active control group. Stratified analyses by frailty status revealed improved ZAVEN global cognition and processing speed scores following SFL in the pre-frail group but not in the robust group. Overall, the study indicates that a computerized program providing a multidomain intervention at home can improve cognition in older adults. Importantly, pre-frail individuals, who are at higher risk of cognitive decline, seem to benefit more from the intervention.

Utility of Diffusion Modeling of Cogstate Brief Battery Test Performance in Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Cognitive testing data are essential to the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and computerized cognitive testing, such as the Cogstate Brief Battery, has proven helpful in efficiently identifying harbingers of dementia. This study provides a side-by-side comparison of traditional Cogstate outcomes and diffusion modeling of these outcomes in predicting MCI diagnosis. Participants included 257 older adults (160 = normal cognition; 97 = MCI). Results showed that both traditional Cogstate and diffusion modeling analyses predicted MCI diagnosis with acceptable accuracy. Cogstate measures of recognition learning and working memory accuracy and diffusion modeling variable of decision-making efficiency (drift rate) and nondecisional time were most predictive of MCI. While participants with normal cognition demonstrated a change in response caution (boundary separation) when transitioning tasks, participants with MCI did not evidence this change.",2023,Cogstate Brief Battery; cognitive screening; diffusion modeling; mild cognitive impairment,"Humans; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Learning; Memory, Short-Term; Neuropsychological Tests","Mulhauser, K; Giordani, B; Kavcic, V; May, LDN; Bhaumik, A; Shair, S; Votruba, K"
