Magnesium and Cognitive Health in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Magnesium (Mg) plays a key role in neurological functioning and manifestations. However, the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohorts on Mg and cognitive health among adults has not been systematically reviewed. We aimed to examine the associations of various Mg forms (supplements, dietary intake, and biomarkers) with cognitive outcomes by summarizing evidence from RCTs and cohorts. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant peer-reviewed articles published up to May 3, 2024. Three random-effects models were performed, when appropriate, to evaluate the relationship between Mg and cognitive outcomes: 1) linear meta-regression, 2) non-linear (quadratic) meta-regression, and 3) meta-analysis using Mg variables categorized based on pre-existing recommendations. Three RCTs and 12 cohort studies were included in this systematic review. Evidence from the limited numbers of RCTs was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of Mg supplements. Cohort studies showed inconsistent dose-response relationships between dietary Mg and cognitive disorders, with high heterogeneity across populations. However, consistent U-shape associations of serum Mg with all-cause dementia and cognitive impairment were found in cohorts, suggesting an optimal serum Mg concentration around 0.85 mmol/L. This non-linear association was detected in meta-regression (P",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; adults; cognition; cognitive impairment; dementia; dietary magnesium; magnesium supplement; meta-analysis; serum magnesium; systematic review,,"Chen, F; Wang, J; Cheng, Y; Li, R; Wang, Y; Chen, Y; Scott, T; Tucker, KL"

Systemic Administration of Neurotransmitter-Derived Lipidoids-PROTACs-DNA Nanocomplex Promotes Tau Clearance and Cognitive Recovery for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant burden on the economy and healthcare systems worldwide. Although the pathophysiology of AD remains debatable, its progression is strongly correlated with the accumulation of tau aggregates. Therefore, tau clearance from brain lesions can be a promising strategy for AD therapy. To achieve this, the present study combined proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), a novel protein-degradation technique that mediates degradation of target proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and a neurotransmitter-derived lipidoid (NT-lipidoid) nanoparticle delivery system with high blood-brain barrier-penetration activity, to generate a novel nanomedicine named NPD. Peptide 1, a cationic tau-targeting PROTAC is loaded onto the positively charged nanoparticles using DNA-intercalation technology. The resulting nanomedicine displayed good encapsulation efficiency, serum stability, drug release profile, and blood-brain barrier-penetration capability. Furthermore, NPD potently induced tau clearance in both cultured neuronal cells and the brains of AD mice. Moreover, intravenous injection of NPD led to a significant improvement in the cognitive function of the AD mice, without any remarkable abnormalities, thereby supporting its clinical development. Collectively, the novel nanomedicine developed in this study may serve as an innovative strategy for AD therapy, since it effectively and specifically induces tau protein clearance in brain lesions, which in turn enhances cognition.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; PROTAC; clearance strategy; nanocomplex; tau protein,,"Gong, B; Zhang, W; Cong, W; Gu, Y; Ji, W; Yin, T; Zhou, H; Hu, H; Zhuang, J; Luo, Y; Liu, Y; Gao, J; Yin, Y"
Circulating levels of neurofilament light chain as a biomarker of infarct and white matter hyperintensity volumes after ischemic stroke.,"Serum neurofilament light chain protein (sNfL) shows promise as a biomarker for infarct size in acute ischemic stroke and for monitoring cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). However, distinguishing the cSVD contribution after stroke may not be possible due to post-stroke sNfL increase. Additionally, it remains unclear if etiologic subtype differences exist. We measured infarct and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes using MRI at the index stroke in ischemic stroke patients (n = 316, mean age 53 years, 65% males) and at 7-year follow-up (n = 187). Serum NfL concentration was measured in the acute phase (n = 235), at 3-months (n = 288), and 7-years (n = 190) post stroke. In multivariable regression, acute and 3-month sNfL concentrations were associated with infarct volume and time since stroke, but not with stroke etiology or infarct location. Seven years post-stroke, sNfL was associated with WMHs and age, but not with stroke etiology. Nonlinear regression estimated that sNfL peaks around 1 month, and declines by 50% at 3 months, and 99% at 9 months. We conclude that sNfL can indicate infarct volume and time since brain injury in the acute and subacute phases after stroke. Due to the significant post-stroke sNfL increase, several months are needed for reliable assessment of cSVD activity.",2024,,Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Neurofilament Proteins; Biomarkers; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Ischemic Stroke; Aged; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Adult,"Holmegaard, L; Jensen, C; Pedersen, A; Blomstrand, C; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Jood, K; Jern, C"

Enhanced neuroprotective effect of verapamil-loaded hyaluronic acid modified carbon quantum dots in an in-vitro model of amyloid-induced Alzheimer's disease.,"This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms and the neuroprotective effect of hyaluronic acid modified verapamil-loaded carbon quantum dots (VRH-loaded HA-CQDs) against an in-vitro Alzheimer's disease model induced by amyloid beta (Aβ) in SH-SY5Y and Neuro 2a neuroblastoma cells. Briefly, different HA-CQDs were prepared using hydrothermal method and optimized by Box-Behnken design to maximize quantum yield and minimize particle size. Serum stable negatively charged VRH-loaded HA-CQDs was successfully prepared by admixing the optimized HA-CQDs and VRH with association efficiency and loading capacity of 81.25 ± 3.65 % and 5.11 ± 0.81 %, respectively. Cells were pretreated with VRH solution or loaded-HA-CQDs followed by exposure to Aβ. Compared to the control group, amyloidosis led to reduction in cellular proliferation, mitochondrial membrane potential, expression of cytochrome P450, cytochrome c oxidase, CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 3, and mitotic index, along with marked increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment with VRH, either free or loaded HA-CQDs, enhanced cell survival, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitotic index, and gene expression. It also reduced inflammation and ROS. However, VRH-loaded HA-CQDs exhibited superior effectiveness in the measured parameters. These findings suggest that VRH-loaded HA-CQDs have enhanced therapeutic potential compared to free VRH in mitigating amyloidosis negative features.",2024,Carbon quantum dots; Neuroblastoma; Verapamil,,"Mosalam, EM; Abdel-Bar, HM; Elberri, AI; Abdallah, MS; Zidan, AA; Batakoushy, HA; Abo Mansour, HE"
Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common neurodegenerative disorders. AD is characterized by deposition of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, leading to associated secondary pathologies, progressive neurodegeneration, and eventually death. Currently used diagnostics are largely image-based, lack accuracy and do not detect early disease, ie, prior to onset of symptoms, thus limiting treatment options and outcomes. Although biomarkers such as amyloid-β and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid have gained much attention, these are generally limited to disease progression. Unfortunately, identification of biomarkers for early and accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. As such, body fluids such as sweat, serum, saliva, mucosa, tears, and urine are under investigation as alternative sources for biomarkers that can aid in early disease detection. This review focuses on biomarkers identified through proteomics in various biofluids and their potential for early and accurate diagnosis of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biofluid; Biomarker; Blood; CSF; Diagnosis; Saliva; Sweat; Tears,,"Rajendran, K; Krishnan, UM"

Half-curcumin-based chemiluminescence probes and their applications in detecting quasi-stable oxidized protein.,"Numerous methods have been reported for detecting ROS/RNS in vitro and in vivo; however, detecting methods for the secondary products of the ROS/RNS reactions, particularly quasi-stable oxidized products, have been much less explored. In this report, we observed that half-curcumins could generate chemiluminescence. In contrast to other chemiluminescence scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of a half-curcumin is the formation of a carbanion intermediate of its acetylacetone moiety, opening unique avenues for applications. In this study, we designed a series of half-curcumins CRANAD-Xs and found that CRANAD-164 could be used to detect quasi-stable oxidized proteins (QSOP) in vivo and in patient serum samples. We illustrated that CRANAD-164 could be used to monitor the responses of taurine, an amino acid with newly reported anti-aging capacity, in an inflammatory mouse model. Remarkably, we further demonstrated that the QSOP levels were much higher in the disease serum samples, including Alzheimer's disease, compared to the samples from healthy controls. Moreover, our results revealed that the sera chemiluminescence intensities were higher in aged healthy controls compared to young healthy subjects, suggesting that CRANAD-164 can be used to monitor the increase of QSOP during aging.",2024,chemiluminescence * Quasi-stable oxidized proteins * CRANAD-164 * liquid biopsy* in vivo imaging,,"Ran, C; Yang, J; Zhu, B; Zhang, J; Liang, SH; Shen, S"

Serum and CSF metabolomics analysis shows Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates risk factors of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a person's dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KD's metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.",2024,Diseases; Metabolomics,,"Schweickart, A; Batra, R; Neth, BJ; Martino, C; Shenhav, L; Zhang, AR; Shi, P; Karu, N; Huynh, K; Meikle, PJ; Schimmel, L; Dilmore, AH; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Blach, C; Dorrestein, PC; Knight, R; Craft, S; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Krumsiek, J"

The combined effect of morin and hesperidin on memory ability and oxidative/nitrosative stress in a streptozotocin-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent neurodegenerative disease within dementias, affects the CNS, leading to gradual memory issues and cognitive dysfunction. Oxidative stress in AD contributes to ongoing neuronal loss and hastens disease progression. Notably, the potent antioxidant compounds morin and hesperidin have demonstrated significant effectiveness in addressing oxidative stress. This study explores the impact of morin and hesperidin on behavior and oxidative stress in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD rat model. The experiment involved five groups: control, STZ, STZ+morin, STZ+hesperidin, and STZ+morin+hesperidin. The rat model of AD was created by injecting STZ with the stereotaxic surgery. Morin and hesperidin were applied to the groups for 7-days. After the applications, the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests were used and the rats were sacrificed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NOx), and protein carbonyl (PC) levels were measured. In the STZ group, the levels of NOx and PC exhibited a noteworthy increase compared to the control. Conversely, the application of morin and/or hesperidin treatments reduced NOx and PC levels compared to the STZ group. The co-administration of morin and hesperidin improved the antioxidant status and decreased lipid peroxidation in STZ-induced rats. In the STZ group, serum advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels were statistically elevated compared to the control. However, in the treatment groups, morin and/or hesperidin successfully decreased AOPP levels to those observed in the control. The combined use of these flavonoids may have a neuroprotective effect regarding memory problems and decreasing oxidative/nitrosative stress.",2024,AOPP; Alzheimer's disease; cognitive functions; flavonoids; neurological oxidative stress; protein carbonyl,,"Yilmazer, UT; Pehlivan, B; Guney, S; Yar-Saglam, AS; Balabanli, B; Kaltalioglu, K; Coskun-Cevher, S"
"Nanocurcumin prevents memory impairment, hippocampal apoptosis, Akt and CaMKII-α signaling disruption in the central STZ model of Alzheimer's disease in rat.","The central route of streptozotocin (STZ) administration has been introduced as a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Curcumin was suggested to possess possible neuroprotective effects, which may be profitable in AD. However, the low bioavailability of curcumin hinders its beneficial effects in clinical studies. Earlier studies suggested that a bovine serum albumin-based nanocurcumin, produces superior neuroprotective effects compared to natural curcumin. In the present study, the protective effect of nanocurcumin in rat model of central STZ induced memory impairment was assessed. In addition, due to the importance of the hippocampus in memory, the amounts of hippocampal active caspase-3, Akt, and CaMKII-α were evaluated. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were used. STZ (icv) was injected during days 1 and 3 (3 mg/kg in divided), and nanocurcumin or curcumin 50 mg/kg/oral gavage was administered daily during days 4-14. Morris water maze training was performed on days 15-17, and the retention memory test was achieved on the 18th day. Following memory assessment, the rats were sacrificed and the hippocampi were used to assess caspase-3 cleavage, Akt, and CaMKII-α signaling. The findings revealed that nanocurcumin ingestion (but not natural curcumin) in the dose of 50 mg/kg was capable to prevent the impairment of water maze learning and memory induced by central STZ. Molecular assessments indicated that STZ treatment increased the caspase-3 cleavage in the hippocampus while deactivating Akt and CaMKII-α. Nanocurcumin reduced caspase-3 cleavage to a non-significant level compared to control group and restored Akt and CaMKII-α within the hippocampus while natural curcumin exerted no significant effect. These findings might suggest that nanocurcumin can restore memory deficit, hippocampal apoptosis as well as Akt and CaMKII-α signaling disruption associated with brain insulin resistance.",2024,Akt; Alzheimer’s disease; CaMKII-α; Hippocampus; Nanocurcumin; Rat,,"Moosavi, M; Soukhaklari, R; Bagheri-Mohammadi, S; Firouzan, B; Javadpour, P; Ghasemi, R"

Once in the central nervous system (CNS), SAA proteins can have both protective and harmful effects, which have important implications for CNS disease. In this review of the thematic series on SAA, we discuss the existing literature that relates SAA to neuroinflammation and CNS disease, and the possible roles of the BBB in these relations.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloidosis; blood–brain barrier; lipoproteins; neuroinflammation; serum amyloid A,Blood-Brain Barrier; Humans; Serum Amyloid A Protein; Animals; Central Nervous System Diseases,"Erickson, MA; Mahankali, AP"

"Role of curcumin on beta-amyloid protein, tau protein, and biochemical and oxidative changes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.","Diabetes is one of the most common endocrine metabolic diseases and is associated with the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Amyloid beta (Aβ) and abnormal tau proteins are effective in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic and protective effects of curcumin on beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation and tau protein expression levels, as well as biochemical and oxidative changes in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. The study comprised five groups, each consisting of eight rats: control, diabetic, curcumin, curcumin during diabetic induction, and curcumin post-diabetic induction. Groups 2 and 4 were administered a single dose of 45 mg/kg streptozotocin on day 1, while group 5 received it on day 28. Curcumin was orally administered via gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day for 35 days to the third, fourth, and fifth groups. At the end of the trial (day 35), blood sugar levels and insulin resistance were similar between the control and curcumin-treated groups but significantly higher in the diabetic groups (P < 0.05). The protective effect of curcumin is tested during induction and active diabetes. The results indicated that diabetic rats displayed increased levels of Aβ, tau protein, and total oxidant capacity (TOS) compared to the curcumin-treated groups. Additionally, the total antioxidant capacity (TAS) levels were lower in the diabetic rats (P < 0.05). Aβ protein levels are lower in both the serum and brain of rats with active diabetes and treated with curcumin compared to control rats (P > 0.05). In addition, serum TAS levels were higher in rats treated with curcumin following the induction of diabetes than pre-induction of diabetes (P > 0.05). The TOS levels in the serum were higher in the rats treated with curcumin during active diabetes compared to the rats treated prior to the induction of diabetes (P < 0.05).

"Chronic Lead Exposure in Adult Mice: Associations with miR-671/CDR1as Regulation, NF-κB Signaling, and Alzheimer's Disease-like Pathology.","Long-term exposure to lead (Pb) can result in chronic damage to the body through accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS) leading to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study delves into the intricate role of miR-671/CDR1as regulation in the etiology of AD-like lesions triggered by chronic Pb exposure in adult mice. To emulate the chronic effects of Pb, we established a rodent model spanning 10 months of controlled Pb administration, dividing 52 C57BL/6J mice into groups receiving varying concentrations of Pb (1, 2, or 4 g/L) alongside an unexposed control. Blood Pb levels were monitored using serum samples to ensure accurate dosing and to correlate with observed toxicological outcomes. Utilizing the Morris water maze, a robust behavioral assay for assessing cognitive functions, we documented a dose-dependent decline in learning and memory capabilities among the Pb-exposed mice. Histopathological examination of the hippocampal tissue revealed tell-tale signs of AD-like neurodegeneration, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. At the molecular level, a significant upregulation of AD-associated genes, namely amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-secretase 1 (BACE1), and tau, was observed in the hippocampal tissue of Pb-exposed mice. This was accompanied by a corresponding surge in the protein levels of APP, BACE1, amyloid-β (Aβ), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), further implicating Pb in the dysregulation of these key AD markers. The expression of CDR1as, a long non-coding RNA implicated in AD pathogenesis, was found to be suppressed in Pb-exposed mice. This observation suggests a potential mechanistic link between Pb-induced neurotoxicity and the dysregulation of the CDR1as/miR-671 axis, which warrants further investigation. Moreover, our study identified a dose-dependent alteration in the intracellular and extracellular levels of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). This finding implicates Pb in the modulation of NF-κB signaling, a pathway that plays a pivotal role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In conclusion, our findings underscored the deleterious effects of Pb exposure on the CNS, leading to the development of AD-like pathology. The observed modulation of NF-κB signaling and miR-671/CDR1as regulation provides a plausible mechanistic framework for understanding the neurotoxic effects of Pb and its potential contribution to AD pathogenesis.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; CDR1as; NF-κB; lead; learning memory; miR-671,,"Qiao, M; Yang, H; Liu, L; Yu, T; Wang, H; Chen, X; Zhang, Y; Duan, A; Lyu, S; Wu, S; Xiao, J; Li, B"
A Simple Sandwich Electrochemical Immunosensor for Rapid Detection of the Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Tau Protein.,"As a typical biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, rapid and specific detection of tau protein can help improve the early diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. In this study, a simple sandwich electrochemical immunosensor was developed for rapid detection of tau protein. Primary monoclonal antibodies (mAb1) against the middle domain of tau protein (amino acids 189-195) were immobilized on the gold electrode surface through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 3,3'-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP). Then the tau protein was captured through the specific adsorption between the antigen and the antibody, resulting in a change in the impedance. Secondary monoclonal antibodies (mAb2) against the N-terminal region of tau protein were used for further amplification of the binding reaction between mAb1 and tau protein. A linear correlation between the total change in impedance and the logarithm of tau concentration was found from 2 × 10",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); immunosensor; impedance; sandwich; tau protein,"tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Biosensing Techniques; Biomarkers; Electrochemical Techniques; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Gold; Immunoassay; Limit of Detection; Electrodes","Yang, M; Chen, Y; Sun, H; Li, D; Li, Y"

Altered brain expression and cerebrospinal fluid levels of TIMP4 in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a highly prevalent and progressive pathology, involving amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the cerebral blood vessel walls. CAA is associated with an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH). Insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with CAA pathology is urgently needed, to develop additional diagnostic tools to allow for reliable and early diagnosis of CAA and to obtain novel leads for the development of targeted therapies. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 4 (TIMP4) is associated with cardiovascular functioning and disease and has been linked to vascular dementia. Using immunohistochemistry, we studied occipital brain tissue samples of 57 patients with CAA (39 without ICH and 18 with ICH) and 42 controls, and semi-quantitatively assessed expression levels of TIMP4. Patients with CAA had increased vascular expression of TIMP4 compared to controls (p < 0.001), and in these patients, TIMP4 expression correlated with CAA severity (τ",2024,Biomarker; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 4,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-4; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases","Jäkel, L; De Kort, AM; Stellingwerf, A; Hernández Utrilla, C; Kersten, I; Vervuurt, M; Vermeiren, Y; Küsters, B; Schreuder, FHBM; Klijn, CJM; Kuiperij, HB; Verbeek, MM"
Lithium and its effects: does dose matter?,"Decades of clinical research have demonstrated the efficacy of lithium in treating acute episodes (both manic and depressive), as well as in preventing recurrences of bipolar disorder (BD). Specific to lithium is its antisuicidal effect, which appears to extend beyond its mood-stabilizing properties. Lithium's clinical effectiveness is, to some extent, counterbalanced by its safety and tolerability profile. Indeed, monitoring of lithium levels is required by its narrow therapeutic index. There is consensus that adequate serum levels should be above 0.6 mEq/L to achieve clinical effectiveness. However, few data support the choice of this threshold, and increasing evidence suggests that lithium might have clinical and molecular effects at much lower concentrations.",2024,BDNF; Drinking water; GSK-3Beta; Micro-dose; Suicide,,"Manchia, M; Paribello, P; Pinna, M; Steardo, L; Carpiniello, B; Pinna, F; Pisanu, C; Squassina, A; Hajek, T"

Association of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Polymorphisms With Serological Lipid and Inflammatory Markers.,"Background  The study aims to assess the association of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphisms with serological lipid and inflammatory markers to determine their potential role in predicting the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Methodology  A total of 915 individuals underwent testing for lipid and inflammatory biomarkers at Vibrant America Clinical Laboratory. Clinical data, blood lipid and inflammatory profiles, and APOE genotyping were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).  Results Compared to the E3/E3 genotype, individuals with E2/E3 genotypes showed higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, apolipoprotein A (APOA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). E2/E4 genotype carriers had higher levels of HDL, triglycerides, Lp(a), and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (BNPNT). E3/E4 genotypes were associated with elevated levels of total cholesterol, LDL, Lp(a), hs-CRP, small-density low-density lipoprotein (SDLDL), oxidized LDL (OXLDL), MPO, LDL-CAL, PLAC, and APOB. The E4/E4 group displayed higher concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL, APOB, Lp(a), hs-CRP, SDLDL, OXLDL, MPO, LDLCAL, and PLAC compared to E3/E3 carriers. These findings highlight the potential atherogenic effect of the ε4 allele and the protective effect of the ε2 allele based on lipid and inflammatory marker profiles.  Conclusions This study provides strong evidence linking APOE gene polymorphism to abnormal serum lipid and inflammatory profiles. Individuals carrying the ε4 alleles exhibited dysregulated lipid metabolism and abnormal inflammatory markers, increasing their risk of CVD and AD.

Target engagement and immunogenicity of an active immunotherapeutic targeting pathological α-synuclein: a phase 1 placebo-controlled trial.,"Investigational therapeutics that target toxic species of α-synuclein (αSyn) aim to slow down or halt disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here this 44-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center phase 1 study investigated safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of UB-312, an active immunotherapeutic targeting pathological αSyn, in patients with PD. The primary outcome measures were adverse event frequency and change in anti-αSyn antibody titers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Exploratory outcomes were changes in clinical scales and biomarker-based target engagement as measured by seed amplification assays. Twenty patients were randomized 7:3 (UB-312:placebo) into 300/100/100 μg or 300/300/300 μg (weeks 1, 5 and 13) intramuscular prime-boost dose groups. Safety was similar across groups; adverse events were mostly mild and transient. Two patients experienced three serious adverse events in total, one possibly treatment related; all resolved without sequalae. Anti-αSyn antibodies in serum from 12/13 and CSF from 5/13 patients who received three UB-312 doses confirmed immunogenicity. Mean serum titers (in log-dilution factor) increased from baseline by 1.398 and 1.354, and peaked at week 29 at 2.520 and 2.133, for 300/100/100 μg and 300/300/300 μg, respectively. CSF titers were 0 at baseline and were 0.182 and 0.032 at week 21, respectively. Exploratory analyses showed no statistical differences in clinical scales but a significant reduction of αSyn seeds in CSF of a subset of UB-312-treated patients.

Revolutionizing Alzheimer's treatment: Harnessing human serum albumin for targeted drug delivery and therapy advancements.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder initiated by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, leading to impaired cognitive function. Several delivery approaches have been improved for AD management. Among them, human serum albumin (HSA) is broadly employed for drug delivery and targeting the Aβ in AD owing to its biocompatibility, Aβ inhibitory effect, and nanoform, which showed blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing ability via glycoprotein 60 (gp60) receptor and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) protein to transfer the drug molecules in the brain. Thus far, there is no previous review focusing on HSA and its drug delivery system in AD. Hence, the reviewed article aimed to critically compile the HSA therapeutic as well as drug delivery role in AD management. It also delivers information on how HSA-incorporated nanoparticles with surfaced embedded ligands such as TAT, GM1, and so on, not only improve BBB permeability but also increase neuron cell targetability in AD brain. Additionally, Aβ and tau pathology, including various metabolic markers likely BACE1 and BACE2, etc., are discussed. Besides, the molecular interaction of HSA with Aβ and its distinctive forms are critically reviewed that HSA can segregate Zn(II) and Cu(II) metal ions from Aβ owing to high affinity. Furthermore, the BBB drug delivery challenges in AD are addressed. Finally, the clinical formulation of HSA for the management of AD is critically discussed on how the HSA inhibits Aβ oligomer and fibril, while glycated HSA participates in amyloid plaque formation, i.e., β-structure sheet formation. This review report provides theoretical background on HSA-based AD drug delivery and makes suggestions for future prospect-related work.",2024,Alzheimer's disease (AD); Beta-amyloid and tau; Drug delivery and nanomedicine; Human serum albumin (HSA) and its modifications; Preclinical and clinical role of HSA,,"Shastri, D; Raj, V; Lee, S"

Neuroprotective Effect of Chlorogenic Acid in an Animal Model of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease Induced by Streptozotocin.,"Alzheimer's Disease is a degenerative neurological condition which leads to a decline in memory and cognitive function. Chlorogenic Acid (CGA) presents properties including neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of CGA on cognitive impairments, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in mice submitted to an experimental model of Sporadic Alzheimer Disease (SAD) induced by intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ). Male Swiss mice received bilateral ICV-STZ injections (3 mg/Kg) on days 1 and 3. The treatment with CGA (5 mg/Kg, orally) or vehicle (water, orally), was initiated and continued for 26 days, starting 2 h after the second induction procedure. At first, there was no change in serum glucose levels after SAD induction. ICV-STZ induces impairments in aversive, recognition, and spatial memory, while CGA treatment significantly alleviated these memory deficits. Furthermore, locomotor activity, working memory, and anxiety-related activities remained unaffected by the treatments. CGA treatment protects against ICV-STZ-induced increase in the nitrite/nitrate and TBARS levels. ICV-STZ induced a reduction in viable cells, depletion of BDNF, and triggered astrogliosis and microgliosis in the cortex and hippocampus. Treatment with CGA preserves viable cell count in the prefrontal cortex, CA1, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Additionally, it prevented BDNF depletion in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG regions), and mitigated astrogliosis and microgliosis in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG regions). These findings indicate the neuroprotective effects of CGA, underscoring their potential as therapeutic agents or adjuncts in the treatment of SAD.",2024,Antioxidant; BDNF; Dementia; Memory; Neuroprotection; Polyphenol,,"Bezerra, JR; de Souza Nascimento, T; Tavares, J; de Aguiar, MSS; Maia, MVV; de Andrade, GM"
Rosuvastatin attenuates total-tau serum levels and increases expression of miR-124-3p in dyslipidemic Alzheimer's patients: a historic cohort study.,"microRNAs are candidate diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to compare Silymarin with Rosuvastatin and placebo on total-Tau protein level and expression levels of microRNAs and TGF-β and COX-2 in Alzheimer's patients with secondary dyslipidemia. 36 mild AD patients with dyslipidemia were divided into three groups of 12. The first group received silymarin (140mg), the second group received placebo (140mg), and the third group recieved Rosuvastatin (10mg). Tablets were administered three times a day for Six months. The blood samples of the patients were collected before and after the intervention and the serum was separated. Using the RT-qPCR method, the expression levels of miR-124-3p and miR-125b-5p were assessed, and the serum levels of total-Tau, TGF-β, and COX-2 enzyme were measured using the ELISA method. Data were analyzed with SPSS software. In this study, the level of Δtotal-Tau was significantly lower in the Rosuvastatin group compared to the placebo (P = 0.038). Also, a significant reduction in the level of ΔTGF-β was observed in the Silymarin to Rosuvastatin group (p = 0.046) and ΔmiR-124-3p was significantly increased in the Rosuvastatin compared to the placebo group (p = 0.044). Rosuvastatin outperformed silymarin in decreasing Δtotal-Tau serum levels and enhancing expression of ΔmiR-124-3p, attributed to Rosuvastatin's capacity to lower cholesterol levels and inflammation concurrently. Conversely, silymarin was more effective than Rosuvastatin in reducing levels of ΔTGF-β. Serum miR-124-3p could serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and a new therapeutic focus in AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; MicroRNAs; Rosuvastatin; Silymarin; Tauopathy,,"Usefi, F; Rustamzadeh, A; Ghobadi, Z; Sadigh, N; Mohebi, N; Ariaei, A; Moradi, F"
The Relation of Serum Vitamin C Concentrations with Alzheimer's Disease Mortality in a National Cohort of Community-Dwelling Elderly Adults.,"The relation of vitamin C with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is equivocal. The aim of this study was to assess the relation of serum vitamin C levels with AD-related mortality, and to evaluate the threshold beyond which the potential benefits of higher serum concentrations of vitamin C for AD mortality ceases. The cohort consisted of 4504 adults aged ≥60 years enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who had serum measures of vitamin C and no cognitive impairment at baseline (1988-1994) and were followed-up for mortality until 2019. Vitamin C was assayed from fasting blood samples using isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography. At baseline, the mean age of participants was 70 years, with 42.7% being men. At the end of follow-up (median: 15 years), the AD mortality rate was 2.4 per 1000 person-years. In the Cox regression models, compared to participants in the lowest tertile of serum vitamin C (<0.56 mg/dL), those in the highest tertile (>0.98 mg/dL) had a lower risk of AD mortality (hazard ratio: 0.44, 95% confidence intervals: 0.25-0.77) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, behavior/lifestyle factors, prevalent health conditions, and dietary vitamin C intake. In dose-response analysis using restricted cubic splines, vitamin C concentrations beyond 2.3 mg/dL were associated with the elevated risk of AD-related mortality. The findings from this national sample of community-dwelling elderly adults suggest that higher levels of serum vitamin C are associated with slower AD disease progression, although levels beyond the normal reference values were associated with a higher risk of AD mortality.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; epidemiology; mortality; vitamin C,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Female; Ascorbic Acid; Aged; Independent Living; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Cohort Studies; Proportional Hazards Models; Aged, 80 and over; Risk Factors","Appiah, D; Ingabire-Gasana, E; Appiah, L; Yang, J"
From Gut to Brain: Uncovering Potential Serum Biomarkers Connecting Inflammatory Bowel Diseases to Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation due to abnormal immune responses to gut microflora. The gut-brain axis is disrupted in IBDs, leading to neurobiological imbalances and affective symptoms. Systemic inflammation in IBDs affects the brain's inflammatory response system, hormonal axis, and blood-brain barrier integrity, influencing the gut microbiota. This review aims to explore the association between dysregulations in the gut-brain axis, serum biomarkers, and the development of cognitive disorders. Studies suggest a potential association between IBDs and the development of neurodegeneration. The mechanisms include systemic inflammation, nutritional deficiency, GBA dysfunction, and the effect of genetics and comorbidities. The objective is to identify potential correlations and propose future research directions to understand the impact of altered microbiomes and intestinal barrier functions on neurodegeneration.

"The potential of five c-miRNAs as serum biomarkers for Late-Onset Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: miR-10a-5p, miR-29b-2-5p, miR-125a-5p, miR-342-3p, and miR-708-5p.","The nervous system is rich in miRNAs, indicating an important role of these molecules in regulating processes associated with cognition, memory, and others. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative imbalances involving such miRNAs may be involved in dementia contexts, including Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD). To test the viability of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) as biomarkers for LOAD, we proceed accordingly to the following reasoning. The first stage was to discover and identify profile of c-miRNAs by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). For this purpose, blood serum samples were used from LOAD patients (n = 5) and cognitively healthy elderly control group (CTRL_CH) (n = 5), all over 70 years old. We identified seven c-miRNAs differentially expressed (p ≤ 0.05) in the serum of LOAD patients compared to CTRL_CH (miR-10a-5p; miR-29b-2-5p; miR-125a-5p; miR-342-3p, miR-708-5p, miR-380-5p and miR-340-3p).

Through the analysis of these target genes in databases, it was possible to observe that they have functions related to the development and progress of LOAD, directly or indirectly connecting the different Alzheimer's pathways. Thus, this work found five promising serum c-miRNAs as options for biomarkers contributing to LOAD diagnosis.

Multi-branch attention Raman network and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for the classification of neurological disorders.,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), a rapid, low-cost, non-invasive, ultrasensitive, and label-free technique, has been widely used in-situ and ex-situ biomedical diagnostics questions. However, analyzing and interpreting the untargeted spectral data remains challenging due to the difficulty of designing an optimal data pre-processing and modelling procedure. In this paper, we propose a Multi-branch Attention Raman Network (MBA-RamanNet) with a multi-branch attention module, including the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) branch, deep convolution module (DCM) branch, and branch weights, to extract more global and local information of characteristic Raman peaks which are more distinctive for classification tasks. CBAM, including channel and spatial aspects, is adopted to enhance the distinctive global information on Raman peaks. DCM is used to supplement local information of Raman peaks.

"Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in the therapeutic intervention of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and stroke.","With the increase in the aging population, the occurrence of neurological disorders is rising. Recently, stem cell therapy has garnered attention due to its convenient sourcing, minimal invasiveness, and capacity for directed differentiation. However, there are some disadvantages, such as poor quality control, safety assessments, and ethical and logistical issues. Consequently, scientists have started to shift their attention from stem cells to extracellular vesicles due to their similar structures and properties. Beyond these parallels, extracellular vesicles can enhance biocompatibility, facilitate easy traversal of barriers, and minimize side effects. Furthermore, stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles can be engineered to load drugs and modify surfaces to enhance treatment outcomes. In this review, we summarize the functions of native stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, subsequently review the strategies for the engineering of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles and their applications in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, and discuss the challenges and solutions associated with the clinical translation of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles.",2024,clinical translation; drug delivery; extracellular vesicle; neurological disease; stem cell,Humans; Extracellular Vesicles; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Stem Cells; Stroke; Stem Cell Transplantation,"Zhou, W; Wang, X; Dong, Y; Gao, P; Zhao, X; Wang, M; Wu, X; Shen, J; Zhang, X; Lu, Z; An, W"
"New insights into butyrylcholinesterase: Pharmaceutical applications, selective inhibitors and multitarget-directed ligands.","Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), also known as pseudocholinesterase and serum cholinesterase, is an isoenzyme of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). It mediates the degradation of acetylcholine, especially under pathological conditions. Proverbial pharmacological applications of BChE, its mutants and modulators consist of combating Alzheimer's disease (AD), influencing multiple sclerosis (MS), addressing cocaine addiction, detoxifying organophosphorus poisoning and reflecting the progression or prognosis of some diseases. Of interest, recent reports have shed light on the relationship between BChE and lipid metabolism. It has also been proved that BChE is going to increase abnormally as a compensator for AChE in the middle and late stages of AD, and BChE inhibitors can alleviate cognitive disorders and positively influence some pathological features in AD model animals, foreboding favorable prospects and potential applications. Herein, the selective BChE inhibitors and BChE-related multitarget-directed ligands published in the last three years were briefly summarized, along with the currently known pharmacological applications of BChE, aiming to grasp the latest research directions. Thereinto, some emerging strategies for designing BChE inhibitors are intriguing, and the modulators based on target combination of histone deacetylase and BChE against AD is unprecedented. Furthermore, the involvement of BChE in the hydrolysis of ghrelin, the inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, and the down-regulation of LDL receptor (LDLR) expression suggests its potential to influence lipid metabolism disorders.

Curcumin-loaded nanoparticles effectively prevent T,"In this study, we report the cardioprotective effect of the glycerol monooleate (GMO) based nanocurcumin in both in vitro and in vivo conditions under a hyperthyroid state. The heart is one of the primary target organs sensitive to the action of thyroid hormone, and slight variations in the thyroid hormone serum concentrations result in measurable changes in cardiac performance. Hyperthyroidism-induced hypermetabolism is associated with oxidative stress and is an important mechanism responsible for the progression of heart failure. Curcumin has been known to play a protective role against oxidative stress-related diseases like Alzheimer's, asthma, and aging due to its antioxidant properties. Nevertheless, its potent biological activity has been hindered due to its poor bioavailability. To overcome this drawback, a GMO-based biodegradable nanoparticle (NP) formulation loaded with curcumin has been developed, and the protective effect of curcumin-loaded NPs was compared against the native drug. Oxidative stress parameters like reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, change in mitochondrial membrane permeability, lipid peroxidation (LPx), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and the activity and protein expression of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase were evaluated. The results from in vitro showed that curcumin-loaded NPs showed better DPPH and NO radical scavenging activity than native curcumin in a concentrations range of 2.5-20 µM. It was also observed that the nanoparticulate curcumin was comparatively more effective than native curcumin in protecting against ROS-induced membrane damage by reducing LPx and LDH leakage at low concentrations of 5-10 µM. Further, curcumin NPs performed better in facilitating the activities of antioxidant enzymes under in vitro and in vivo conditions with respect to time and concentrations, resulting in reduced cellular ROS levels. In this scenario, we anticipate that curcumin-loaded NPs can serve as a better antioxidant than its native counterpart in protecting the heart from oxidative stress-related diseases.",2024,antioxidant; curcumin; nanoparticles; oxidative stress; thyroxine,"Curcumin; Animals; Oxidative Stress; Nanoparticles; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Male; Reactive Oxygen Species; Antioxidants; Myocardium; Heart; Lipid Peroxidation","Mishra, P; Sahoo, DK; Mohanty, C; Samanta, L"

Serum albumin-embedding copper nanoclusters inhibit Alzheimer's β-amyloid fibrillogenesis and neuroinflammation.,"Increasing evidence suggests that the accumulations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), β-amyloid (Aβ), and neuroinflammation are crucial pathological hallmarks for the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet there are few effective treatment strategies. Therefore, design of nanomaterials capable of simultaneously elimination of ROS and inhibition of Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation is urgently needed for AD treatment. Herein, we designed human serum albumin (HSA)-embedded ultrasmall copper nanoclusters (CuNCs@HSA) via an HSA-mediated fabrication strategy. The as-prepared CuNCs@HSA exhibited outstanding multiple enzyme-like properties, including superoxide dismutase (>5000 U/mg), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities as well as hydroxyl radicals scavenging ability. Besides, CuNCs@HSA prominently inhibited Aβ fibrillization, and its inhibitory potency was 2.5-fold higher than native HSA. Moreover, CuNCs@HSA could significantly increase the viability of Aβ-treated cells from 60 % to over 96 % at 40 μg/mL and mitigate Aβ-induced oxidative stresses. The secretion of neuroinflammatory cytokines by lipopolysaccharide-induced BV-2 cells, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, was alleviated by CuNCs@HSA. In vivo studies manifested that CuNCs@HSA effectively suppressed the formation of plaques in transgenic C. elegans, reduced ROS levels, and extended C. elegans lifespan by 5 d. This work, using HSA as a template to mediate the fabrication of copper nanoclusters with robust ROS scavenging capability, exhibited promising potentials in inhibiting Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation for AD treatment.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Copper nanoclusters; Inhibition; Reactive oxygen species scavenging; β-amyloid protein,"Copper; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Animals; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Reactive Oxygen Species; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Serum Albumin, Human; Caenorhabditis elegans; Particle Size; Oxidative Stress; Cell Survival; Cell Line; Serum Albumin; Surface Properties","Liu, L; Liu, W; Sun, Y; Dong, X"

Understanding the impact of pre-analytic conditions of in vitro IDE levels is imperative for reliable biomarker assessment. This study explored the influence of freeze-thaw cycles, storage temperature, and storage time on IDE levels in human serum. Serum samples from seven healthy volunteers were subjected to various storage conditions, including refrigeration (4 °C) and freezing (-20 °C and -80 °C) for 24 h and six months, with differing freeze-thaw cycles. In vitro IDE levels were measured at 24 h and after 6 months using ELISA. Results indicate that while short-term storage at either -20 °C or -80 °C yielded similar IDE levels, prolonged storage and multiple freeze-thaw cycles significantly impacted IDE stability, with colder temperatures exhibiting better preservation. Although further research with larger cohorts and longer storage time is warranted to establish clinical significance, our study suggests preferential use of unthawed samples or consistent freeze-thaw conditions for accurate IDE assessment. Thus, optimizing sample storage conditions is paramount for reliable IDE biomarker analysis in clinical and research settings.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Diabetes type 2; In vitro stability; Insulin-degrading enzyme; Metabolic function; Storage conditions,,"Kullenberg, H; Svedberg, MM"

Towards Early Diagnosis and Screening of Alzheimer's Disease Using Frequency Locked Whispering Gallery Mode Microtoroid Biosensors.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive form of dementia affecting almost 55 million people worldwide. It is characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles within the brain, leading to a pathological cascade of neuron degeneration and death as well as memory loss and cognitive decline. Amyloid beta (Aβ) is an AD biomarker present in cerebrospinal fluid and blood serum and correlates with the presence of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain. Measuring the levels of Aβ can help with early diagnosis of AD, which is key for studying novel AD drugs and delaying the symptoms of dementia. However, this goal is difficult to achieve due to the low levels of AD biomarkers in biofluids. Here we demonstrate for the first time the use of FLOWER (frequency locked optical whispering evanescent resonator) for quantifying the levels of post-mortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 in clinicopathologically classified control, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants.

Clinical values of serum C5a in Alzheimer's disease patients with different dementia stages.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal inflammatory responses, and complement C5a (C5a) is known to initiate inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the associations between serum C5a, inflammatory responses, and cognitive function in AD patients. A total of 242 AD patients and 132 age-matched controls were included. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed increased levels of C5a, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α with advancing stages of AD. Pearson correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic curve revealed positive correlations between serum C5a levels, inflammatory cytokine levels, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores, and negative correlations with Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores. Serum C5a above 68.68 pg/mL could aid in the diagnosis of AD. Multivariable logistic analysis revealed that serum C5a was an independent risk factor for IL-1β/IL-6/IL-10/TNF-α and an independent protective factor for IL-4. Higher serum C5a levels were associated with lower MMSE and MoCA scores. In conclusion, elevated serum C5a levels were beneficial for AD diagnosis and predictive of inflammation and cognitive dysfunction.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive function; Complement C5a; Inflammatory response; MMSE,,"Yang, C; Wu, X; Feng, J; Wu, C; Cui, X; Wang, Z; Yang, L"

ACE Phenotyping in Human Blood and Tissues: Revelation of ACE Outliers and Sex Differences in ACE Sialylation.,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) metabolizes a number of important peptides participating in blood pressure regulation and vascular remodeling. Elevated ACE expression in tissues (which is generally reflected by blood ACE levels) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Elevated blood ACE is also a marker for granulomatous diseases. Decreased blood ACE activity is becoming a new risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. We applied our novel approach-ACE phenotyping-to characterize pairs of tissues (lung, heart, lymph nodes) and serum ACE in 50 patients. ACE phenotyping includes (1) measurement of ACE activity with two substrates (ZPHL and HHL); (2) calculation of the ratio of hydrolysis of these substrates (ZPHL/HHL ratio); (3) determination of ACE immunoreactive protein levels using mAbs to ACE; and (4) ACE conformation with a set of mAbs to ACE. The ACE phenotyping approach in screening format with special attention to outliers, combined with analysis of sequencing data, allowed us to identify patient with a unique ACE phenotype related to decreased ability of inhibition of ACE activity by albumin, likely due to competition with high CCL18 in this patient for binding to ACE. We also confirmed recently discovered gender differences in sialylation of some glycosylation sites of ACE. ACE phenotyping is a promising new approach for the identification of ACE phenotype outliers with potential clinical significance, making it useful for screening in a personalized medicine approach.",2024,CCL18; albumin; angiotensin I-converting enzyme; conformational changes; outliers; precision medicine; screening,,"Enyedi, EE; Petukhov, PA; Kozuch, AJ; Dudek, SM; Toth, A; Fagyas, M; Danilov, SM"

Exosomes as a therapeutic tool to promote neurorestoration and cognitive function in neurological conditions: Achieve two ends with a single effort.,"Exosomes possess a significant role in intercellular communications. In the nervous system, various neural cells release exosomes that not only own a role in intercellular communications but also eliminate the waste of cells, maintain the myelin sheath, facilitate neurogenesis, and specifically assist in normal cognitive function. In neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stroke, exosomal cargo like miRNAs take part in the sequela of conditions and serve as a diagnostic tool of neurological disorders, too. Exosomes are not only a diagnostic tool but also their inhibition or administration from various sources like mesenchymal stem cells and serum, which have shown a worthy potential to treat multiple neurological disorders.

Altering plasma lipids and liver enzyme activities via hippocampal injections of hen Lysozyme amyloid aggregates in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model: Insights into the therapeutic role of Bis (Indolyl) phenylmethane.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent form of dementia in the elderly. There is currently no effective treatment available for this disease. Diagnosis of AD typically relies on clinical manifestations and specific biomarkers. The present study investigated the impact of inducing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mice through the injection of lysozyme amyloids formed in the presence or absence of Bis (Indolyl) phenylmethane (BIPM) on alterations in plasma lipid profiles and liver enzyme activities. 24 adult Wistar rats were divided into control, Scopolamine, Lysozyme, BIPM groups and the blood samples were obtained from the groups for biochemical analysis. The findings of the study revealed significant changes in the plasma lipid profiles and liver enzyme markers of the Lysozyme group compared to the control group. The Lysozyme group exhibited elevated triglycerides (n = 6, P < 0.02) and LDL levels (n = 6, P < 0.02), reduced HDL (n = 6, P < 0.05) and cholesterol levels (n = 6, P < 0.02), and altered serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) level (n = 6, P < 0.05) compared to controls. While the level of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) did not change significantly compared to the control. BIPM groups showed no significant changes in lipid or enzyme levels compared to controls. Overall, our research has shown that BIPM has the ability to modify the structure of HEWL aggregates, thereby improving the detrimental effects associated with AD caused by these aggregates.

Nucleic acid aptamer-based electrochemical sensor for the detection of serum P-tau231 and the instant screening test of Alzheimer's disease.,"The instant screening of patients with a tendency towards developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is significant for providing preventive measures and treatment. However, the current imaging-based technology cannot meet the requirements in the early stage. Developing biosensor-based liquid biopsy technology could be overcoming this bottleneck problem. Herein, we developed a simple, low-cost, and sensitive electrochemical aptamer biosensor for detecting phosphorylated tau protein threonine 231 (P-tau231), the earliest and one of the most efficacious abnormally elevated biomarkers of AD. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were electrochemically synthesized on a glassy carbon electrode as the transducer, exhibiting excellent conductivity, and were applied to amplify the electrochemical signal. A nucleic acid aptamer was designed as the receptor to capture the P-tau231 protein, specifically through the formation of an aptamer-antigen complex.

Neuroprotection of macamide in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease involves Nrf2 signaling pathway and gut microbiota.,"The underlying mechanisms of macamide's neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) were investigated in the paper. Macamides are considered as unique ingredients in maca. Improvement effects and mechanisms of macamide on cognitive impairment have not been revealed. In this study, Vina 1.1.2 was used for docking to evaluate the binding abilities of 12 main macamides to acetylcholinesterase (AChE). N-benzyl-(9Z,12Z)-octadecadienamide (M 18:2) was selected to study the following experiments because it can stably bind to AChE with a strong binding energy. The animal experiments showed that M 18:2 prevented the scopolamine (SCP)-induced cognitive impairment and neurotransmitter disorders, increased the positive rates of Nrf2 and HO-1 in hippocampal CA1, improved the synaptic plasticity by maintaining synaptic morphology and increasing the synapse density. Moreover, the contents of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the hippocampus, serum, and colon were reduced by M 18:2. Furthermore, M 18:2 promoted colonic epithelial integrity and partially restored the composition of the gut microbiota to normal, including decreased genera Clostridiales_unclassified and Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, as well as increased genera Muribaculaceae_unclassified, Muribaculum, Alistipes, and Bacteroides, which may be the possible biomarkers of cognitive aging.

In Search for Low-Molecular-Weight Ligands of Human Serum Albumin That Affect Its Affinity for Monomeric Amyloid β Peptide.,"An imbalance between production and excretion of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in the brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients leads to Aβ accumulation and the formation of noxious Aβ oligomers/plaques. A promising approach to AD prevention is the reduction of free Aβ levels by directed enhancement of Aβ binding to its natural depot, human serum albumin (HSA). We previously demonstrated the ability of specific low-molecular-weight ligands (LMWLs) in HSA to improve its affinity for Aβ. Here we develop this approach through a bioinformatic search for the clinically approved AD-related LMWLs in HSA, followed by classification of the candidates according to the predicted location of their binding sites on the HSA surface, ranking of the candidates, and selective experimental validation of their impact on HSA affinity for Aβ. The top 100 candidate LMWLs were classified into five clusters. The specific representatives of the different clusters exhibit dramatically different behavior, with 3- to 13-fold changes in equilibrium dissociation constants for the HSA-Aβ40 interaction: prednisone favors HSA-Aβ interaction, mefenamic acid shows the opposite effect, and levothyroxine exhibits bidirectional effects. Overall, the LMWLs in HSA chosen here provide a basis for drug repurposing for AD prevention, and for the search of medications promoting AD progression.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid β peptide; human serum albumin; low-molecular-weight ligand; protein–ligand interaction; surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Ligands; Serum Albumin, Human; Protein Binding; Alzheimer Disease; Molecular Weight; Binding Sites; Peptide Fragments","Deryusheva, EI; Shevelyova, MP; Rastrygina, VA; Nemashkalova, EL; Vologzhannikova, AA; Machulin, AV; Nazipova, AA; Permyakova, ME; Permyakov, SE; Litus, EA"
"A Nonlinear Relation between Body Mass Index and Long-Term Poststroke Functional Outcome-The Importance of Insulin Resistance, Inflammation, and Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein-1.","Both high serum insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (s-IGFBP-1) and insulin resistance (IR) are associated with poor functional outcome poststroke, whereas overweight body mass index (BMI; 25-30) is related to fewer deaths and favorable functional outcome in a phenomenon labeled ""the obesity paradox"". Furthermore, IGFBP-1 is inversely related to BMI, in contrast to the linear relation between IR and BMI. Here, we investigated s-IGFBP-1 and IR concerning BMI and 7-year poststroke functional outcome. We included 451 stroke patients from the Sahlgrenska Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS) with baseline measurements of s-IGFBP1, homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), BMI (categories: normal-weight (8.5-25), overweight (25-30), and obesity (>30)), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a measure of general inflammation. Associations with poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score: 3-6) after 7 years were evaluated using multivariable binary logistic regression, with overweight as reference due to the nonlinear relationship. Both normal-weight (odds-ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-4.14) and obese (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.08-4.71) patients had an increased risk of poor functional outcome, driven by deaths only in the normal-weight. In normal-weight, s-IGFBP-1 modestly attenuated (8.3%) this association. In the obese, the association was instead attenuated by HOMA-IR (22.4%) and hs-CRP (10.4%).

Role of Calcitriol and Vitamin D Receptor (,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) buildup and neuronal degeneration. An association between low serum vitamin D levels and an increased risk of AD has been reported in several epidemiological studies. Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) is the active form of vitamin D, and is generated in the kidney and many other tissues/organs, including the brain. It is a steroid hormone that regulates important functions like calcium/phosphorous levels, bone mineralization, and immunomodulation, indicating its broader systemic significance. In addition, calcitriol confers neuroprotection by mitigating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, promoting the clearance of Aβ, myelin formation, neurogenesis, neurotransmission, and autophagy. The receptors to which calcitriol binds (vitamin D receptors; VDRs) to exert its effects are distributed over many organs and tissues, representing other significant roles of calcitriol beyond sustaining bone health. The biological effects of calcitriol are manifested through genomic (classical) and non-genomic actions through different pathways.

Cholinesterase inhibitors are associated with potential cholinergic side effects that, when severe, can result in cholinergic crises. Although crises induced by other cholinesterase inhibitors, such as distigmine and rivastigmine, have been reported, cases of galantamine-induced cholinergic crises remain undocumented. This study presents a case of cholinergic crisis triggered by galantamine overdose in an 89-year-old woman weighing 37 kg with Alzheimer's disease history, even though her serum cholinesterase levels were normal. The patient overdosed on 264 mg of galantamine, leading to rapid deterioration, marked by restlessness, tremors, sweating, diarrhea, pharyngeal gurgling, and severe hypoxia. Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient exhibited pinpoint pupils, compromised airway, and low oxygen saturation, necessitating immediate intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit. After 72 h, the patient successfully recovered and was weaned off mechanical ventilation, maintaining normal serum cholinesterase levels. Animal studies suggest a lethal galantamine threshold of 3 to 6 mg/kg in humans. Unlike other cholinesterase inhibitors that typically reduce serum cholinesterase levels during cholinergic crises, galantamine appears to selectively inhibit acetylcholinesterase, possibly sparing butyrylcholinesterase. This selectivity may explain the normal serum cholinesterase levels.",2024,cholinergic crisis; galantamine; galantamine overdose; lethal dose; serum cholinesterase level,,"Suzuki, A; Mayahara, T; Katayama, T; Arai, H; Matsuura, K; Nagata, K; Maruo, E"
Apolipoprotein E Is Upregulated in Blood and Circulating Monocytes of Indian Patients With Visceral Leishmaniasis.,"Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been associated with several diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. ApoE also has documented immunomodulatory functions. We investigated gene expression in circulating monocytes and in bone marrows of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) living in an endemic area in Bihar, India, and contrasted these with control healthy subjects or other diagnostic bone marrows from individuals in the same region. Samples from VL patients were obtained prior to initiating treatment. Our study revealed significant upregulated expression of the apoE transcript in patients with VL. Furthermore, the levels of ApoE protein were elevated in serum samples of subjects with VL compared with healthy endemic controls. These observations may provide clues regarding the complex interactions between lipid metabolism and immunoregulation of infectious and inflammatory diseases.",2024,ApoE; Apolipoprotein E; India; leishmaniasis; monocytes; visceral leishmaniasis,"Adolescent; Adult; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Apolipoproteins E; Bone Marrow; India; Leishmaniasis, Visceral; Monocytes; Up-Regulation","Kausar, G; Chauhan, SB; Roy, R; Kumar, S; Engwerda, C; Nylen, S; Kumar, R; Wilson, ME; Sundar, S"
Association of APOE genotype with blood-brain barrier permeability in neurodegenerative disorders.,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is recognized for its role in modulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in vitro, which may have significant implications for the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. However, evidence in vivo is contrasting. This study explores the impact of APOE genotypes on BBB integrity among 230 participants experiencing cognitive impairment, encompassing cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as various non-AD neurodegenerative conditions. To assess BBB integrity, we utilized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratios and CSF/serum kappa and lambda free light chains (FLCs) as indirect markers. Our findings show a dose-dependent increase in BBB permeability in individuals carrying the APOE ε4 allele, marked by elevated CSF/serum albumin and FLCs ratios, with this trend being especially pronounced in AD patients. These results highlight the association of APOE ε4 with BBB permeability, providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,APOE genotype; Albumin; Blood-brain barrier; Free light chains; Kappa; Lambda; Permeability,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Alleles; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins E; Blood-Brain Barrier; Cognitive Dysfunction; Genetic Association Studies; Genotype; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Permeability; Serum Albumin","Libri, I; Silvestri, C; Caratozzolo, S; Alberici, A; Pilotto, A; Archetti, S; Trainini, L; Borroni, B; Padovani, A; Benussi, A"

Unraveling the molecular basis of cannabidiolic acid methyl Ester's anti-depressive effects in a rat model of treatment-resistant depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) stands as a significant cause of disability globally. Cannabidiolic Acid-Methyl Ester (CBDA-ME) (EPM-301, HU-580), a derivative of Cannabidiol, demonstrates immediate antidepressant-like effects, yet it has undergone only minimal evaluation in psychopharmacology. Our goal was to investigate the behavioral and potential molecular mechanisms associated with the chronic oral administration of this compound in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) genetic model of treatment-resistant depression. Male WKY rats were subjected to behavioral assessments before and after receiving chronic (14-day) oral doses of CBDA-ME (0.5 mg/kg), 15 mg/kg of imipramine or vehicle. At the end of the study, plasma corticosterone levels and mRNA expression of various genes in the medial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus were measured. Behavioral outcomes from CBDA-ME treatment indicated an antidepressant-like effect similar to imipramine, as oral ingestion reduced immobility and increased swimming duration in the Forced Swim Test. Neither treatment influenced locomotion in the Open Field Test nor preference in the Saccharin Preference Test. The behavioral impact in WKY rats coincided with reduced corticosterone serum levels, upregulated mRNA expression of Cannabinoid receptor 1, Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase, and Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor 1, alongside downregulation of the Serotonin Transporter in the hippocampus. Additionally, there was an upregulation of CB1 mRNA expression and downregulation of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in the mPFC. These findings contribute to our limited understanding of the antidepressant effects of CBDA-ME and shed light on its potential psychopharmacological mechanisms.

Sodium oligomannate activates the enteroendocrine-vagal afferent pathways in APP/PS1 mice.,"Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) and vagal afferent neurons constitute functional sensory units of the gut, which have been implicated in bottom-up modulation of brain functions. Sodium oligomannate (GV-971) has been shown to improve cognitive functions in murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and recently approved for the treatment of AD patients in China. In this study, we explored whether activation of the EECs-vagal afferent pathways was involved in the therapeutic effects of GV-971. We found that an enteroendocrine cell line RIN-14B displayed spontaneous calcium oscillations due to TRPA1-mediated calcium entry; perfusion of GV-971 (50, 100 mg/L) concentration-dependently enhanced the calcium oscillations in EECs. In ex vivo murine jejunum preparation, intraluminal infusion of GV-971 (500 mg/L) significantly increased the spontaneous and distension-induced discharge rate of the vagal afferent nerves.

Increased intestinal bile acid absorption contributes to age-related cognitive impairment.,"Cognitive impairment in the elderly is associated with alterations in bile acid (BA) metabolism. In this study, we observe elevated levels of serum conjugated primary bile acids (CPBAs) and ammonia in elderly individuals, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and aging rodents, with a more pronounced change in females. These changes are correlated with increased expression of the ileal apical sodium-bile acid transporter (ASBT), hippocampal synapse loss, and elevated brain CPBA and ammonia levels in rodents. In vitro experiments confirm that a CPBA, taurocholic acid, and ammonia induced synaptic loss. Manipulating intestinal BA transport using ASBT activators or inhibitors demonstrates the impact on brain CPBA and ammonia levels as well as cognitive decline in rodents.

ST2 levels and neurodegenerative diseases: is this a significant relation?,"Interleukin-33 (IL-33), belonging to the interleukin-1 cytokine family, has a decoy receptor soluble ST2 (sST2). IL-33 is found in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and is involved in central nervous system healing and repair, whereas ST2 is found in microglia and astrocytes. Some studies have found a link between changes in the IL-33/ST2 pathway and neurodegenerative disorders. This review article investigates the relationship between the interleukin-33 (IL-33)/ST2 pathway and neurodegenerative disorders. It was discovered that soluble st2 levels were increased. Furthermore, IL-33 levels were found to be lower in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The association with other disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), was also observed. Various studies suggest that ST2/IL-33 signalling may be pivotal in the disease modulation of neurodegenerative disorders. The serum sST2 level test can be useful in determining the inflammatory status and severity of illness in many neurodegenerative disorders.

Corinthian Currants Promote the Expression of Paraoxonase-1 and Enhance the Antioxidant Status in Serum and Brain of 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Paraoxonase-1 (PON1), a serum antioxidant enzyme, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis that involves early oxidative damage. Corinthian currants and their components have been shown to display antioxidant and other neuroprotective effects in AD. We evaluated the effect of a Corinthian currant paste-supplemented diet (CurD), provided to 1-month-old 5xFAD mice for 1, 3, and 6 months, on PON1 activity and levels of oxidation markers in serum and the brain of mice as compared to a control diet (ConD) or glucose/fructose-matched diet (GFD). Administration of CurD for 1 month increased PON1 activity and decreased oxidized lipid levels in serum compared to ConD and GFD. Longer-term administration of CurD did not, however, affect serum PON1 activity and oxidized lipid levels. Furthermore, CurD administered for 1 and 3 months, but not for 6 months, increased PON1 activity and decreased free radical levels in the cortex of mice compared to ConD and GFD. To probe the mechanism for the increased PON1 activity in mice, we studied the effect of Corinthian currant polar phenolic extract on PON1 activity secreted by Huh-7 hepatocytes or HEK293 cells transfected with a PON1-expressing plasmid. Incubation of cells with the extract led to a dose-dependent increase of secreted PON1 activity, which was attributed to increased cellular PON1 expression. Collectively, our findings suggest that phenolics in Corinthian currants can increase the hepatic expression and activity of antioxidant enzyme PON1 and that a Corinthian currant-supplemented diet during the early stages of AD in mice reduces brain oxidative stress.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Corinthian currants; antioxidant effect; enzyme activity; mouse model; paraoxonase-1; protein expression,"Animals; Aryldialkylphosphatase; Alzheimer Disease; Mice; Antioxidants; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Mice, Transgenic; Oxidative Stress; Male","Lymperopoulos, D; Dedemadi, AG; Voulgari, ML; Georgiou, E; Dafnis, I; Mountaki, C; Panagopoulou, EA; Karvelas, M; Chiou, A; Karathanos, VT; Chroni, A"
Involvement of Glucosamine 6 Phosphate Isomerase 2 (GNPDA2) Overproduction in β-Amyloid- and Tau P301L-Driven Pathomechanisms.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative olfactory disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Alterations in the hexosamine- or glucose-related pathways have been described through AD progression. Specifically, an alteration in glucosamine 6 phosphate isomerase 2 (GNPDA2) protein levels has been observed in olfactory areas of AD subjects. However, the biological role of GNPDA2 in neurodegeneration remains unknown. Using mass spectrometry, multiple GNPDA2 interactors were identified in human nasal epithelial cells (NECs) mainly involved in intraciliary transport. Moreover, GNPDA2 overexpression induced an increment in NEC proliferation rates, accompanied by transcriptomic alterations in Type II interferon signaling or cellular stress responses. In contrast, the presence of beta-amyloid or mutated Tau-P301L in GNPDA2-overexpressing NECs induced a slowdown in the proliferative capacity in parallel with a disruption in protein processing. The proteomic characterization of Tau-P301L transgenic zebrafish embryos demonstrated that GNPDA2 overexpression interfered with collagen biosynthesis and RNA/protein processing, without inducing additional changes in axonal outgrowth defects or neuronal cell death.

AD is characterized by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins, particularly p-tau217 and p-tau231, have been identified as promising biomarker candidates to differentiate the disease progression from preclinical stages. This narrative review is devoted to a critical evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of p-tau217 and p-tau231 levels in the detection of AD, measured in plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, compared to established biomarkers. Additionally, the efficacy of these markers in distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative disorders is examined. The significant advances offered by p-tau217 and p-tau231 in AD diagnostics are highlighted, demonstrating their unique utility in early detection and differential diagnosis. This comprehensive analysis not only confirms the excellent diagnostic capabilities of these markers, but also deepens the understanding of the molecular dynamics of AD, contributing to the broader scientific discourse on neurodegenerative diseases. This review is aimed to provide key information for researchers and clinicians across disciplines, filling interdisciplinary gaps and highlighting the role of p-tau proteins in revolutionizing AD research and clinical practice.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid plaques; biomarker; diagnosis; neurodegenerative diseases; neurofibrillary tangles; p-tau; p-tau217; p-tau231; tau proteins,,"Jarek, DJ; Mizerka, H; Nuszkiewicz, J; Szewczyk-Golec, K"

Glucose-modified BSA/procyanidin C1 NPs penetrate the blood-brain barrier and alleviate neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence, long duration and poor prognosis. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a physiologic barrier in the central nervous system, which hinders the entry of most drugs into the brain from the blood, thus affecting the efficacy of drugs for AD. Natural products are recognized as one of the promising and unique therapeutic approaches to treat AD. To improve the efficiency and therapeutic effect of the drug across the BBB, a natural polyphenolic compound, procyanidin C-1 (C1) was encapsulated in glucose-functionalized bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles to construct Glu-BSA/C1 NPs in our study. Glu-BSA/C1 NPs exhibited good stability, slow release, biocompatibility and antioxidant properties. In addition, Glu-BSA/C1 NPs penetrated the BBB, accumulated in the brain by targeting Glut1, and maintained the BBB integrity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Glu-BSA/C1 NPs alleviated memory impairment of 5 × FAD mice by reducing Aβ deposition and Tau phosphorylation and promoting neurogenesis. Mechanistically, Glu-BSA/C1 NPs significantly activated the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibited the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1β pathway thereby suppressing neuroinflammation. Taken together, Glu-BSA/C1 NPs could penetrate the BBB and mitigate neuroinflammation in AD, which provides a new therapeutic approach targeting AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Blood-brain barrier; Nanoparticles; Neuroinflammation; Procyanidin C-1,"Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Animals; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Mice; Glucose; Nanoparticles; Disease Models, Animal; Proanthocyanidins; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Biflavonoids; Catechin; Humans; Male","Duan, L; Hao, Z; Ji, R; Li, X; Wang, H; Su, Y; Guan, F; Ma, S"

A surface-independent bioglue using photo-crosslinkable benzophenone moiety.,"Surface coating technology is broadly demanded across various fields, including marine and biomedical materials; therefore, a facile and versatile approach is desired. This study proposed an attractive surface coating strategy using photo-crosslinkable benzophenone (BP) moiety for biomaterials application. BP-containing ""bioglue"" polymer can effectively crosslink with all kinds of surfaces and biomolecules. Upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, free radical reaction from the BP glue facilitates the immobilization of diverse molecules onto different substrates in a straightforward and user-friendly manner. Through either one-step, mixing the bioglue with targeted biomolecules, or two-step methods, pre-coating the bioglue and then adding targeted biomolecules, polyacrylic acid (PAA), cyclic RGD-containing peptides, and proteins (gelatin, collagen, and fibronectin) were successfully immobilized on substrates. After drying the bioglue, targeted biomolecules can still be immobilized on the surfaces preserving their bioactivity. Cell culture on biomolecule-immobilized surfaces using NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) showed significant improvement of cell adhesion and activity compared to the unmodified control in serum-free media after 24 hours. Furthermore, hBMSCs on the fibronectin-immobilized surface showed an increased calcium deposition after 21 days of osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that the immobilized fibronectin is highly bioactive. Given the straightforward protocol and substrate-independent bioglue, the proposed coating strategy is promising in broad-range fields.",2024,,,"Shi, Y; Tao, X; Du, P; Pasic, P; Esser, L; Chen, HY; Thissen, H; Wang, PY"

Serum neurofilament light chain and inflammatory cytokines as biomarkers for early detection of mild cognitive impairment.,"To investigate the association between serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, inflammatory cytokines, and cognitive function to assess their utility in the early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 157 community-dwelling individuals aged 55 years and above, categorized into healthy controls, MCI, and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Serum levels of NfL, inflammatory cytokines, and AD pathology markers were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Correlations between these biomarkers and cognitive function were analyzed, and the diagnostic performance of the cognitive assessment scales and serum biomarker concentrations was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Serum NfL levels were significantly elevated in MCI and probable AD groups compared to healthy controls. Positive correlations were found between serum NfL and inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and Aβ40. Combining serum NfL with p-tau217 and the Boston Naming Test significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy for MCI. However, combining serum NfL with inflammatory markers did not improve MCI prediction accuracy. Elevated serum NfL is associated with cognitive impairment and inflammatory markers, suggesting its potential as a peripheral serum biomarker for MCI detection. The combination of serum NfL with p-tau217 and cognitive tests could offer a more accurate prediction of MCI, providing new insights for AD treatment strategies.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Inflammatory cytokines; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuroflament light,Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofilament Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Jing, X; Wang, L; Song, M; Geng, H; Li, W; Huo, Y; Huang, A; Wang, X; An, C"
"Serum GFAP levels correlate with astrocyte reactivity, post-mortem brain atrophy and neurofibrillary tangles.","Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a proxy of astrocyte reactivity, has been proposed as biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. However, there is limited information about the correlation between blood biomarkers and post-mortem neuropathology. In a single-centre prospective clinicopathological cohort of 139 dementia patients, for which the time-frame between GFAP level determination and neuropathological assessment was exceptionally short (on average 139 days), we analysed this biomarker, measured at three time points, in relation to proxies of disease progression such as cognitive decline and brain weight. Most importantly, we investigated the use of blood GFAP to detect the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, while accounting for potential influences of the most frequent brain co-pathologies. The main findings demonstrated an association between serum GFAP level and post-mortem tau pathology (β = 12.85; P < 0.001) that was independent of amyloid deposits (β = 13.23; P = 0.02). A mediation analysis provided additional support for the role of astrocytic activation as a link between amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pre-mortem serum GFAP and brain weight at post-mortem (r = -0.35; P < 0.001). This finding, together with evidence of a negative correlation with cognitive assessments (r = -0.27; P = 0.005), supports the role of GFAP as a biomarker for disease monitoring, even in the late phases of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the diagnostic performance of GFAP in advanced dementia patients was explored, and its discriminative power (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve at baseline = 0.91) in differentiating neuropathologically-confirmed Alzheimer's disease dementias from non-Alzheimer's disease dementias was determined, despite the challenging scenario of advanced age and frequent co-pathologies in these patients. Independently of Alzheimer's disease, serum GFAP levels were shown to be associated with two other pathologies targeting the temporal lobes-hippocampal sclerosis (β = 3.64; P = 0.03) and argyrophilic grain disease (β = -6.11; P = 0.02). Finally, serum GFAP levels were revealed to be correlated with astrocyte reactivity, using the brain GFAP-immunostained area as a proxy (ρ = 0.21; P = 0.02). Our results contribute to increasing evidence suggesting a role for blood GFAP as an Alzheimer's disease biomarker, and the findings offer mechanistic insights into the relationship between blood GFAP and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, highlighting its ties with tau burden. Moreover, the data highlighting an independent association between serum GFAP levels and other neuropathological lesions provide information for clinicians to consider when interpreting test results. The longitudinal design and correlation with post-mortem data reinforce the robustness of our findings. However, studies correlating blood biomarkers and neuropathological assessments are still scant, and further research is needed to replicate and validate these results in diverse populations.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; astrocyte; blood biomarkers; neuropathology; tau,"Humans; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Astrocytes; Female; Male; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Aged; Atrophy; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Autopsy; tau Proteins; Prospective Studies; Middle Aged; Disease Progression; Dementia","Sánchez-Juan, P; Valeriano-Lorenzo, E; Ruiz-González, A; Pastor, AB; Rodrigo Lara, H; López-González, F; Zea-Sevilla, MA; Valentí, M; Frades, B; Ruiz, P; Saiz, L; Burgueño-García, I; Calero, M; Del Ser, T; Rábano, A"

Differential expression of N-glycopeptides derived from serum glycoproteins in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of memory loss that affects cognitive abilities with the aging of individuals, such as language or visual/spatial comprehension. MCI is considered a prodromal phase of more complicated neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and better understanding of the disease prognosis will facilitate prevention of neurodegeneration. However, the existing diagnostic methods fail to provide precise and well-timed diagnoses, and the pathophysiology of MCI is not fully understood. Alterations of the serum N-glycoproteome expression could represent an essential contributor to the overall pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and be used as a potential marker to assess MCI diagnosis using less invasive procedures. In this approach, we identified N-glycopeptides with different expressions between healthy and MCI patients from serum glycoproteins. Seven of the N-glycopeptides showed outstanding AUC values, among them the antithrombin-III Asn224 + 4-5-0-2 with an AUC value of 1.00 and a p value of 0.0004.

Functional connectivity changes in neurodegenerative biomarker-positive athletes with repeated concussions.,"Multimodal biomarkers may identify former contact sports athletes with repeated concussions and at risk for dementia. Our study aims to investigate whether biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration in former professional athletes with repetitive concussions (ExPro) is associated with worse cognition and mood/behavior, brain atrophy, and altered functional connectivity. Forty-one contact sports athletes with repeated concussions were divided into neurodegenerative biomarker-positive (n = 16) and biomarker-negative (n = 25) groups based on positivity of serum neurofilament light-chain. Six healthy controls (negative for biomarkers) with no history of concussions were also analyzed. We calculated cognitive and mood/behavior composite scores from neuropsychological assessments. Gray matter volume maps and functional connectivity of the default mode, salience, and frontoparietal networks were compared between groups using ANCOVAs, controlling for age, and total intracranial volume. The association between the connectivity networks and sports characteristics was analyzed by multiple regression analysis in all ExPro. Participants presented normal-range mean performance in executive function, memory, and mood/behavior tests. The ExPro groups did not differ in professional years played, age at first participation in contact sports, and number of concussions. There were no differences in gray matter volume between groups. The neurodegenerative biomarker-positive group had lower connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) compared to the healthy controls and the neurodegenerative biomarker-negative group. DMN disconnection was associated with increased number of concussions in all ExPro. Biomarkers of neurodegeneration may be useful to detect athletes that are still cognitively normal, but with functional connectivity alterations after concussions and at risk of dementia.",2024,Atrophy; Biomarkers; Concussion; Functional connectivity; Neurodegeneration,Humans; Male; Brain Concussion; Adult; Biomarkers; Female; Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neurofilament Proteins; Neuropsychological Tests; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Gray Matter; Connectome; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Default Mode Network; Nerve Net,"Garcia-Cordero, I; Vasilevskaya, A; Taghdiri, F; Khodadadi, M; Mikulis, D; Tarazi, A; Mushtaque, A; Anssari, N; Colella, B; Green, R; Rogaeva, E; Sato, C; Grinberg, M; Moreno, D; Hussain, MW; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Davis, KD; Wennberg, R; Tator, C; Tartaglia, MC"
Increased molar ratio of free fatty acids to albumin in blood as cause and early biomarker for the development of cataracts and Alzheimer's disease.,"Cataracts and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are closely linked and are associated with aging and with systemic diseases that increase the molar ratio of free fatty acids to albumin (mFAR) in the blood. From the results of our earlier studies on the development of senile cataracts and from results recently published in the literature on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, we suggest that there is a common lipotoxic cascade for both diseases, explaining the strong connection between aging, an elevated mFAR in the blood, cataract formation, and AD. Long-chain free fatty acids (FFA) are transported in the blood as FFA/albumin complexes. In young people, vascular albumin barriers in the eyes and brain, very similar in their structure and effect, reduce the FFA/albumin complex concentration from around 650 μmol/l in the blood to 1-3 μmol/l in the aqueous humour of the eyes as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid of the brain. At such low concentrations the fatty acid uptake of the target cells - lens epithelial and brain cells - rises with increasing FFA/albumin complex concentrations, especially when the fatty acid load of albumin molecules is mFAR>1. At higher albumin concentrations, for instance in blood plasma or the interstitial tissue spaces, the fatty acid uptake of the target cells becomes increasingly independent of the FFA/albumin complex concentration and is mainly a function of the mFAR (Richieri et al., 1993). In the blood plasma of young people, the mFAR is normally below 1.0. In people over 40 years old, aging increases the mFAR by decreasing the plasma concentration of albumin and enhancing the plasma concentrations of FFA. The increase in the mFAR in association with C6-unsaturated FFA are risk factors for the vascular albumin barriers (Hennig et al., 1984). Damage to the vascular albumin barrier in the eyes and brain increases the concentration of FFA/albumin complex in the aqueous humour as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the death of lens epithelial and brain cells, the development of cataracts, and AD. An age-dependent increase in the concentration of FFA/albumin complex has been found in the aqueous humour of 177 cataract patients, correlating with the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic death of lens epithelial cells, lens opacification and cataracts (Iwig et al., 2004). Mitochondrial dysfunction is also an early crucial event in Alzheimer's pathology, closely connected with the generation of amyloid beta peptides (Leuner et al., 2012). Very recently, amyloid beta production has also been confirmed in the lenses of Alzheimer's patients, causing cataracts (Moncaster et al., 2022). In view of this, we propose that there is a common lipotoxic cascade for senile cataract formation and senile AD, initiated by aging and/or systemic diseases, leading to an mFAR>1 in the blood.",2024,Aging; Albumin; Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; Cataracts; Free fatty acids; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Vascular albumin barriers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cataract; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Biomarkers; Serum Albumin; Aging; Lens, Crystalline","Glaesser, D; Iwig, M"

"Serum NFL and tau, but not serum UCHL-1 and GFAP or CSF SNAP-25, NPTX2, or sTREM2, correlate with delirium in a 3-year retrospective analysis.","Delirium represents a common terminal pathway of heterogeneous neurological conditions characterized by disturbances in consciousness and attention. Contemporary theories highlight the acute impairment of synaptic function and network connectivity, driven by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter imbalances. However, established biomarkers are still missing. Innovative diagnostic techniques, such as single-molecule array analysis, enable the detection of biomarkers in blood at picomolar concentrations. This approach paves the way for deeper insights into delirium and potentially therapeutic targets for tailored medical treatments. In a retrospective 3-year study, we investigated seven biomarkers indicative of neuroaxonal damage [neurofilament light chain (NFL), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCHL-1), and tau protein], microglial activation [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2)], and synaptic dysfunction [synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) and neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2)]. The analysis of 71 patients with delirium, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-AD controls revealed that serum NFL levels are higher in delirium cases compared to both AD and non-AD. This suggests that elevated NFL levels in delirium are not exclusively the result of dementia-related damage. Serum tau levels were also elevated in delirium cases compared to controls. Conversely, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SNAP-25 showed higher levels in AD patients compared to controls only. These findings add to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that serum NFL could be a valuable biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in delirium research. Although SNAP-25 and NPTX2 did not exhibit significant differences in delirium, the exploration of synaptic biomarkers remains promising for enhancing our understanding of this condition.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; delirium; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neurofilament light chain; neuronal pentraxin 2; single-molecule array; soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; tau protein,,"Piel, JHA; Bargemann, L; Leypoldt, F; Wandinger, KP; Dargvainiene, J"
Untargeted metabolomics reveals intervention effects of wine-processed Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide on Alzheimer's disease mice.,"Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (SC) is a traditional sedative in China, with wide applications for treating various neurological disorders. Its polysaccharide component has been gaining increased attention for its potential in nerve protection. While raw SC is the primary focus of current research, its processed products are primarily utilized as clinical medicines. Notably, limited research exists on the mechanisms underlying the effects of wine-processed Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (WSCP) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Therefore, this study seeks to assess the therapeutic impact of WSCP on AD mice and investigate the underlying mechanisms through biochemical and metabolomics analyses. The results demonstrate that WSCP exerts significant therapeutic effects on AD mice by enhancing learning and memory abilities, mitigating hippocampal neuronal damage, reducing abnormal amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and attenuating hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Biochemical analysis revealed that WSCP can increase SOD content and decrease MDA, IL-6, and TNF-α content in AD mice. Furthermore, serum metabolomic results showed that WSCP intervention can reverse metabolic disorders in AD mice. 43 endogenous metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers for WSCP treatment of AD, and the major metabolic pathways were Ala, Glu and Asp metabolism, TCA cycle. Overall, these findings will provide a basis for further development of WSCP.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Metabolomics; Wine-processed Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide,"Animals; Schisandra; Alzheimer Disease; Polysaccharides; Mice; Metabolomics; Wine; Disease Models, Animal; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Hippocampus; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Metabolome; Memory","Wu, L; Guo, X; Gao, Y; Yu, W; Qin, W; Kuang, H; Su, Y"

Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and dementia in a community-dwelling Japanese older population (JPSC-AD).,"In recent years, the association between neuroinflammatory markers and dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), has attracted much attention. However, the evidence for the relationship between serum-hs-CRP and dementia including AD are inconsistent. Therefore, the relationships of serum high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) with dementia including AD and with regions of interest of brain MRI were investigated. A total of 11,957 community residents aged 65 years or older were recruited in eight sites in Japan (JPSC-AD Study). After applying exclusion criteria, 10,085 participants who underwent blood tests and health-related examinations were analyzed. Then, serum hs-CRP levels were classified according to clinical cutoff values, and odds ratios for the presence of all-cause dementia and its subtypes were calculated for each serum hs-CRP level. In addition, the association between serum hs-CRP and brain volume regions of interest was also examined using analysis of covariance with data from 8614 individuals in the same cohort who underwent brain MRI. After multivariable adjustment, the odds ratios (ORs) for all-cause dementia were 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.43), 1.68 (95%CI 1.08-2.61), and 1.51 (95%CI 1.08-2.11) for 1.0-1.9 mg/L, 2.0-2.9 mg/L, and ≥ 3.0 mg/L, respectively, compared to < 1.0 mg/L, and those for AD were 0.72 (95%CI 0.48-1.08), 1.76 (95%CI 1.08-2.89), and 1.61 (95%CI 1.11-2.35), for 1.0-1.9 mg/L, 2.0-2.9 mg/L, and ≥ 3.0 mg/L, respectively, compared to < 1.0 mg/L. Multivariable-adjusted ORs for all-cause dementia and for AD prevalence increased significantly with increasing serum hs-CRP levels (p for trend < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). In addition, the multivariable-adjusted temporal cortex volume/estimated total intracranial volume ratio decreased significantly with increasing serum hs-CRP levels (< 1.0 mg/L 4.28%, 1.0-1.9 mg/L 4.27%, 2.0-2.9 mg/L 4.29%, ≥ 3.0 mg/L 4.21%; p for trend = 0.004).

A non-targeting magnetic metal-organic framework probe for highly specific peptide-mediated precise disease monitoring.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a universal neurodegenerative disease in older adults with incurable and progressive properties, urging for precise monitoring to perform timely treatment to delay its progression. Herein, we introduced a non-targeting magnetic metal-organic framework probe coupled with high-throughput mass spectrometry, creating a rapid screening strategy for highly specific peptides associated with AD. Notably, an elution-free extraction process was proposed, significantly reducing sample preprocessing time while simultaneously ensuring the efficient detection of captured peptides. Using this elution-free extraction process, high-quality peptide profiles were rapidly extracted from the hundreds of samples from both diseased and healthy individuals. By integrating machine learning algorithms, LC-MS/MS, and Uniprot database searching, we identified three specific serum endogenous peptides (m/z = 4215.41, 2884.77 and 2704.61) closely associated with AD. Remarkably, with the use of any single specific peptide, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) values can reach approximately 0.9 during monitoring AD. Moreover, integrating three specific biomarkers provides a robust basis for machine learning algorithms to build monitoring models, with AUC value up to 1.000. This work represents a substantial advancement in the development of peptide-specific precise monitoring approaches for complex diseases, serving as a catalyst for increased dedication to the molecular detection field.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Disease diagnosis; Magnetic metal-organic frameworks; Mass spectrometry; Peptidomics,Metal-Organic Frameworks; Humans; Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Machine Learning; Biomarkers; Tandem Mass Spectrometry,"Zhang, W; Xu, Z; Zhang, X; Yan, Y; Deng, C; Sun, N"

Cryopreservation of cerebrospinal fluid cells preserves the transcriptional landscape for single-cell analysis.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) matrix biomarkers have become increasingly valuable surrogate markers of neuropsychiatric diseases in research and clinical practice. In contrast, CSF cells have been rarely investigated due to their relative scarcity and fragility, and lack of common collection and cryopreservation protocols, with limited exceptions for neurooncology and primary immune-based diseases like multiple sclerosis. the advent of a microfluidics-based multi-omics approach to studying individual cells has allowed for the study of cellular phenotyping, intracellular dynamics, and intercellular relationships that provide multidimensionality unable to be obtained through acellular fluid-phase analyses. challenges to cell-based research include site-to-site differences in handling, storage, and thawing methods, which can lead to inaccuracy and inter-assay variability. In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (10x Genomics) on fresh or previously cryopreserved human CSF samples from three alternative cryopreservation methods: Fetal Bovine Serum with Dimethyl sulfoxide (FBS/DMSO), FBS/DMSO after a DNase step (a step often included in epigenetic studies), and cryopreservation using commercially available Recovery© media. In comparing relative differences between fresh and cryopreserved samples, we found little effect of the cryopreservation method on being able to resolve donor-linked cell type proportions, markers of cellular stress, and overall gene expression at the single-cell level, whereas donor-specific differences were readily discernable. We further demonstrate the compatibility of fresh and cryopreserved CSF immune cell sequencing using biologically relevant sexually dimorphic gene expression differences by donor. Our findings support the utility and interchangeability of FBS/DMSO and Recovery cryopreservation with fresh sample analysis, providing a methodological grounding that will enable researchers to further expand our understanding of the CSF immune cell contributions to neurological and psychiatric disease.",2024,10x; Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Methods; Neuroimmunology; Omics; Single-cell; Transcriptomics,"Humans; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; Cryoprotective Agents; Cells, Cultured; Cryopreservation; Single-Cell Analysis; Cell Survival","Kodali, MC; Antone, J; Alsop, E; Jayakumar, R; Parikh, K; Chiot, A; Sanchez-Molina, P; Ajami, B; Arnold, SE; Jensen, K; Das, S; Weinberg, MS"

"Association Between Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitor Use and Cognitive Functions, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, and Pentraxin-3 Levels in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.","Background Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings have made the relationship between the inhibition of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme and cognitive functions an important research topic. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the association between DPP-4 inhibitor use and cognitive functions, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, compared with the patients who only use metformin treatment. Design, patients, and methods A total of 50 patients with type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c levels at ≤%7.5) who were under treatment with metformin±DPP-4 inhibitor (n=25) or only metformin (n=25) were included in this cross-sectional study. Serum BDNF and PTX-3 levels were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A standardized mini-mental test (sMMSE) was used to evaluate cognitive functions. Results There were no significant differences in the characteristics of the study groups. The mean sMMSE score of the patients receiving DPP-4±metformin treatment was statistically higher when compared with patients receiving only metformin treatment (27.16±1.95 vs. 25.40±3.07; p=0.041).

High Frequency of Autoantibodies in COVID-19 Patients with Central Nervous System Complications: a Multicenter Observational Study.,"We present a panel of central nervous system (CNS) complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their clinical characteristics. We aim to investigate associations between neurological autoantibodies and COVID-19 patients with predominant CNS complications. In this retrospective multi-center study, we analyze neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 patients from Dec. 2022 to Feb. 2023 at four tertiary hospitals in China. CSF and/or serum in the enrolled patients were tested for autoantibodies using tissue-based assays (TBAs) and cell-based assays (CBAs). A total of 34 consecutive patients (median age was 40.5 years [range 15-83], 50% were female) were enrolled. CNS syndromes included encephalitis (n=15), encephalopathies (n=6), meningoencephalitis (n=3), ADEM (n=2), depression (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n=2), Parkinson disease (n=1), and central nervous system vasculitis (n=1). Twenty-eight specimens (of 44 tested; 11/27 [40.7%] CSF, 13/17 [76.5%] serums) were confirmed by TBAs to be autoantibodies positive. However, only a few autoantibodies (1 with MOG and 1 with NMDAR) were detected by CBAs assays. Twenty-four patients received immunotherapy. After a mean time of 7.26 months of follow-up, 75.8% (25/33) of patients had good outcome (mRS score ≤2). Although no significant difference was observed between the two groups, the proportion of positive CSF autoantibodies in the poor outcomes group was higher than that in the good outcomes group (57.1% vs 31.5%, P = 0.369). Autoantibodies were frequently observed in COVID-19-associated CNS complications. The identification of these autoantibody-positive COVID-19 cases is important as they respond favorably to immunotherapy.",2024,Autoantibodies; CNS complications; COVID-19; Prognosis; Treatment,,"Lin, J; Zheng, D; Tian, D; Zheng, P; Zhang, H; Li, C; Lei, C; Shi, F; Wang, H"
Homocysteine-potentiated Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 promotes senescence of neuroblastoma 2a cells via inhibiting ubiquitination of β-catenin.,"Elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy) level is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and accelerates cell aging. However, the mechanism by which Hcy induces neuronal senescence remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed that Hcy significantly promoted senescence in neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells with elevated β-catenin and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) levels. Intriguingly, Hcy promoted the interaction between KEAP1 and the Wilms tumor gene on the X chromosome (WTX) while hampering the β-catenin-WTX interaction. Mechanistically, Hcy attenuated the methylation level of the KEAP1 promoter CpG island and activated KEAP1 transcription. However, a slow degradation rate rather than transcriptional activation contributed to the high level of β-catenin. Hcy-upregulated KEAP1 competed with β-catenin to bind to WTX. Knockdown of both β-catenin and KEAP1 attenuated Hcy-induced senescence in N2a cells. Our data highlight a crucial role of the KEAP1-β-catenin pathway in Hcy-induced neuronal-like senescence and uncover a promising target for AD treatment.",2024,KEAP1; homocysteine; methylation; senescence; β‐catenin,"beta Catenin; Cellular Senescence; Animals; Homocysteine; Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1; Mice; Cell Line, Tumor; Ubiquitination; Neuroblastoma; Humans; Neurons","Zhang, Y; Xie, JZ; Jiang, YL; Yang, SJ; Wei, H; Yang, Y; Wang, JZ"
Which neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers method is better in theranostic of Alzheimer's disease? An umbrella review.,"Biomarkers are measured to evaluate physiological and pathological processes as well as responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers can be classified as diagnostic, prognostic, predictor, clinical, and therapeutic. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple biomarkers have been reported so far. Nevertheless, finding a specific biomarker in AD remains a major challenge. Three databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were selected with the keywords of Alzheimer's disease, neuroimaging, biomarker, and blood. The results were finalized with 49 potential CSF/blood and 35 neuroimaging biomarkers.

Disturbed sex hormone milieu in males and females with major depressive disorder and low-grade inflammation.,"Sex hormones have biological effects on inflammation, and these might contribute to the sex-specific features of depression. C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most widely used inflammatory biomarker and consistent evidence shows a significant proportion (20-30 %) of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have CRP levels above 3 mg/L, a threshold indicating at least low-grade inflammation. Here, we investigate the interplay between sex hormones and CRP in the cross-sectional, observational Biomarkers in Depression Study. We measured serum high-sensitivity (hs-)CRP, in 64 healthy controls and 178 MDD patients, subdivided into those with hs-CRP below 3 mg/L (low-CRP; 53 males, 72 females) and with hs-CRP above 3 mg/L (high-CRP; 19 males, 34 females). We also measured interleukin-6, testosterone, 17-β-estradiol (E2), progesterone, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle-stimulating and luteinising hormones, and calculated testosterone-to-E2 ratio (T/E2), free androgen and estradiol indexes (FAI, FEI), and testosterone secretion index. In males, high-CRP patients had lower testosterone than controls (p = 0.001), and lower testosterone (p = 0.013), T/E2 (p < 0.001), and higher FEI (p = 0.015) than low-CRP patients. In females, high-CRP patients showed lower SHGB levels than controls (p = 0.033) and low-CRP patients (p = 0.034).

Kallistatin leads to cognition impairment via downregulating glutamine synthetase.,"In many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), glutamate-mediated neuronal excitotoxicity is considered the basis for cognitive impairment. The mRNA and protein expression of SERPINA4(Kallistatin) are higher in patients with AD. However, whether Kallistatin plays a regulatory role in glutamate-glutamine cycle homeostasis remains unclear. In this study, we identified impaired cognitive function in Kallistatin transgenic (KAL-TG) mice. Baseline glutamate levels were elevated and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency was increased in the hippocampus, suggesting the impairment of glutamate homeostasis in KAL-TG mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Kallistatin promoted lysine acetylation and ubiquitination of glutamine synthetase (GS) and facilitated its degradation via the proteasome pathway, thereby downregulating GS. Fenofibrate improved cognitive memory in KAL-TG mice by downregulating serum Kallistatin. Collectively, our study findings provide insights the mechanism by which Kallistatin regulates cognitive impairment, and suggest the potential of fenofibrate to prevente and treat of AD patients with high levels of Kallistatin.",2024,Cognition impairment; Glutamine synthetase; Kallistatin; Proteasome-mediated degradation,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase; Fenofibrate; Alzheimer Disease; Mice, Transgenic; Glutamic Acid; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Serpins","Long, Y; Zhao, Z; Xie, W; Shi, J; Yang, F; Zhu, D; Jiang, P; Tang, Q; Ti, Z; Jiang, B; Yang, X; Gao, G; Qi, W"

Magnesium-L-threonate treats Alzheimer's disease by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202410000-00029/figure1/v/2024-02-06T055622Z/r/image-tiff Disturbances in the microbiota-gut-brain axis may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Magnesium-L-threonate has recently been found to have protective effects on learning and memory in aged and Alzheimer's disease model mice. However, the effects of magnesium-L-threonate on the gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease remain unknown. Previously, we reported that magnesium-L-threonate treatment improved cognition and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in a double-transgenic line of Alzheimer's disease model mice expressing the amyloid-β precursor protein and mutant human presenilin 1 (APP/PS1). Here, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze changes in the microbiome and serum metabolome following magnesium-L-threonate exposure in a similar mouse model. Magnesium-L-threonate modulated the abundance of three genera in the gut microbiota, decreasing Allobaculum and increasing Bifidobacterium and Turicibacter. We also found that differential metabolites in the magnesium-L-threonate-regulated serum were enriched in various pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The western blotting detection on intestinal tight junction proteins (zona occludens 1, occludin, and claudin-5) showed that magnesium-L-threonate repaired the intestinal barrier dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggest that magnesium-L-threonate may reduce the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease through the microbiota-gut-brain axis in model mice, providing an experimental basis for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,,,"Liao, W; Wei, J; Liu, C; Luo, H; Ruan, Y; Mai, Y; Yu, Q; Cao, Z; Xu, J; Zheng, D; Sheng, Z; Zhou, X; Liu, J"
National plans and awareness campaigns as priorities for achieving global brain health.,"Neurological conditions are the leading cause of death and disability combined. This public health crisis has become a global priority with the introduction of WHO's Intersectoral Global Action Plan on Epilepsy and Other Neurological Disorders 2022-2031 (IGAP). 18 months after this plan was adopted, global neurology stakeholders, including representatives of the OneNeurology Partnership (a consortium uniting global neurology organisations), take stock and advocate for urgent acceleration of IGAP implementation. Drawing on lessons from relevant global health contexts, this Health Policy identifies two priority IGAP targets to expedite national delivery of the entire 10-year plan: namely, to update national policies and plans, and to create awareness campaigns and advocacy programmes for neurological conditions and brain health. To ensure rapid attainment of the identified priority targets, six strategic drivers are proposed: universal community awareness, integrated neurology approaches, intersectoral governance, regionally coordinated IGAP domestication, lived experience-informed policy making, and neurological mainstreaming (advocating to embed brain health into broader policy agendas). Contextualised with globally emerging IGAP-directed efforts and key considerations for intersectoral policy design, this novel framework provides actionable recommendations for policy makers and IGAP implementation partners. Timely, synergistic pursuit of the six drivers might aid WHO member states in cultivating public awareness and policy structures required for successful intersectoral roll-out of IGAP by 2031, paving the way towards brain health for all.",2024,,Humans; Global Health; Health Policy; Policy Making; Public Health; Brain,"Winter, SF; Walsh, D; Catsman-Berrevoets, C; Feigin, V; Destrebecq, F; Dickson, SL; Leonardi, M; Hoemberg, V; Tassorelli, C; Ferretti, MT; Dé, A; Chadha, AS; Lynch, C; Bakhtadze, S; Saylor, D; Hwang, S; Rostasy, K; Kluger, BM; Wright, C; Zee, PC; Dodick, DW; Jaarsma, J; Owolabi, MO; Zaletel, J; Albreht, T; Dhamija, RK; Helme, A; Laurson-Doube, J; Amos, A; Baingana, FK; Baker, GA; Sofia, F; Galvin, O; Hawrot, T"

Reducing brain Aβ burden ameliorates high-fat diet-induced fatty liver disease in APP/PS1 mice.,"High-fat diet (HFD)-induced fatty liver disease is a deteriorating risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitigating fatty liver disease has been shown to attenuate AD-like pathology in animal models. However, it remains unclear whether enhancing Aβ clearance through immunotherapy would in turn attenuate HFD-induced fatty liver or whether its efficacy would be compromised by long-term exposure to HFD. Here, the therapeutic potentials of an anti-Aβ antibody, NP106, was investigated in APP/PS1 mice by HFD feeding for 44 weeks. The data demonstrate that NP106 treatment effectively reduced Aβ burden and pro-inflammatory cytokines in HFD-fed APP/PS1 mice and ameliorated HFD-aggravated cognitive impairments during the final 18 weeks of the study. The rejuvenating characteristics of microglia were evident in APP/PS1 mice with NP106 treatment, namely enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis and attenuated microglial lipid accumulation, which may explain the benefits of NP106. Surprisingly, NP106 also reduced HFD-induced hyperglycemia, fatty liver, liver fibrosis, and hepatic lipids, concomitant with modifications in the expressions of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The data further reveal that brain Aβ burden and behavioral deficits were positively correlated with the severity of fatty liver disease and fasting serum glucose levels. In conclusion, our study shows for the first time that anti-Aβ immunotherapy using NP106, which alleviates AD-like disorders in APP/PS1 mice, ameliorates fatty liver disease. Minimizing AD-related pathology and symptoms may reduce the vicious interplay between central AD and peripheral fatty liver disease, thereby highlighting the importance of developing AD therapies from a systemic disease perspective.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Anti-Aβ antibody; Fatty liver; High-fat diet; Microglial phagocytosis,"Mice; Animals; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Mice, Transgenic; Diet, High-Fat; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Liver Diseases; Fatty Liver; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Tsay, HJ; Gan, YL; Su, YH; Sun, YY; Yao, HH; Chen, HW; Hsu, YT; Hsu, JT; Wang, HD; Shie, FS"

Sex-specific modification effects were noted: in women, cortisol exhibited stronger associations with Aβ load and frontal CMRglc, the latter being more pronounced postmenopause. In men, cortisol exhibited stronger associations with gray matter volume and PCr/ATP measures. Higher cortisol was associated with poorer delayed memory in men but not in women.

The Interplay Between Dietary Choline and Cardiometabolic Disorders: A Review of Current Evidence.,"Choline is an essential nutrient for human health and cellular homeostasis as it is necessary for the synthesis of lipid cell membranes, lipoproteins, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The aim of this review is to analyze the beneficial effects of choline and its significance in cellular metabolism and various inflammatory pathways, such as the inflammasome.

These procedures have been optimized for the analysis of multiple biological samples from human patients and transgenic animal models, including blood serum, various brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, striatum, olfactory bulbs), and other peripheral organs (e.g., liver, kidney, spleen, thymus).",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Direct MS analysis; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Multi-platform; Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography,"Animals; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics; Chromatography, Reverse-Phase","González-Domínguez, Á; Sayago, A; Fernández-Recamales, Á; González-Domínguez, R"
Glypican-4 serum levels are associated with cognitive dysfunction and vascular risk factors in Parkinson's disease.,"Glypicans are biomarkers for various pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Increasing evidence suggests that glypicans also play a role in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Initially described as supporting functionality of synapses via glutamate receptors during CNS development, Glypican 4 (GPC-4) also plays a role in the context of dementia via tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease, which is also a co-pathology in Parkinson's disease dementia. However, clinical evidence of circulating GPC-4 in Parkinson's disease (PD) is missing so far. We therefore investigated GPC-4 in biofluids of PD patients. We analyzed GPC-4 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n = 140), serum (n = 80), and tear fluid samples (n = 70) of PD patients and control subjects in a similar age range by ELISA (serum, CSF) and western blot (tear fluid). Expression of circulating GPC-4 was confirmed in all three biofluids, with highest levels in serum. Interestingly, GPC-4 levels were age-dependent, and multiple regression analysis revealed a significant association between GPC-4 serum levels and MoCA score, suggesting an involvement of GPC-4 in PD-associated cognitive decline. Furthermore, stratification of PD patients for vascular risk factors revealed a significant increase of GPC-4 serum levels in PD patients with vascular risk factors. Our results suggest GPC-4 as a clinical biomarker for vascular risk stratification in order to identify PD patients with increased risk of developing dementia.",2024,Biomarker; Dementia; Glypican-4; Parkinson’s disease; Vascular risk factors,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Glypicans; Parkinson Disease; Risk Factors; tau Proteins,"Tatenhorst, L; Maass, F; Paul, H; Dambeck, V; Bähr, M; Dono, R; Lingor, P"

Exploring the significance of caspase-cleaved tau in tauopathies and as a complementary pathology to phospho-tau in Alzheimer's disease: implications for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting.,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that typically require postmortem examination for a definitive diagnosis. Detecting neurotoxic tau fragments in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum provides an opportunity for in vivo diagnosis and disease monitoring. Current assays primarily focus on total tau or phospho-tau, overlooking other post-translational modifications (PTMs). Caspase-cleaved tau is a significant component of AD neuropathological lesions, and experimental studies confirm the high neurotoxicity of these tau species. Recent evidence indicates that certain caspase-cleaved tau species, such as D13 and D402, are abundant in AD brain neurons and only show a modest degree of co-occurrence with phospho-tau, meaning caspase-truncated tau pathology is partially distinct and complementary to phospho-tau pathology. Furthermore, these caspase-cleaved tau species are nearly absent in 4-repeat tauopathies. In this review, we will discuss the significance of caspase-cleaved tau in the development of tauopathies, specifically emphasizing its role in AD. In addition, we will explore the potential of caspase-cleaved tau as a biomarker and the advantages for drug development targeting caspase-6. Developing specific and sensitive assays for caspase-cleaved tau in biofluids holds promise for improving the diagnosis and monitoring of tauopathies, providing valuable insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Caspases; Diagnosis; Postmortem; Tau; Tauopathies,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Caspases; Tauopathies; Biomarkers,"Rizzi, L; Grinberg, LT"
"Icariin, astragaloside a and puerarin mixture attenuates cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice via inhibition of ferroptosis-lipid peroxidation.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that seriously threatens the quality of life of the elderly. Its pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. Ferroptosis, a cell death caused by excessive accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Uncontrolled lipid peroxidation is the core process of ferroptosis, and inhibiting lipid peroxidation of ferroptosis may be an important therapeutic target for AD. Based on previous studies, we mixed standards of icariin, astragaloside IV, and puerarin, named the standard mixture YHG, and investigated the effect of YHG on ferroptosis -lipid peroxidation in APP/PS1 mice. DFX, a ferroptosis inhibitor, was used as a control drug. In this study, APP/PS1 mice were used as an AD animal model, and behavioral experiments, iron level detection, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, lipid peroxidation level detection, antioxidant capacity detection, immunofluorescence, Western blot and real-time qPCR were performed. It was found that YHG could reduce body weight, significantly improve abnormal behaviors and the ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons in APP/PS1 mice. The results of biochemical tests showed that YHG reduced the contents of iron, malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid peroxide (LPO) in brain tissue and serum, and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH). Immunofluorescence, WesternBlot and real-time qPCR results showed that YHG could promote the expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) and glutathione peroxidase 4(GPX4). Inhibited the expression of long-chain acyllipid coenzyme a synthetase 4(ACSL4) and lysophosphatidyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3). This study suggests that the mechanism by which YHG improves cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice may be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis-lipid peroxidation.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Astragaloside A; Astragaloside IV (Pubchem CID: 13943297); Ferroptosis-lipid peroxidation; Iacriin (Pubchem CID: 5318997); Icariin; Puerarin; Puerarin (Pubchem CID: 5281807),Humans; Aged; Animals; Mice; Lipid Peroxidation; Ferroptosis; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Quality of Life; Lipid Peroxides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Iron; 1-Acylglycerophosphocholine O-Acyltransferase; Flavonoids; Isoflavones; Saponins; Triterpenes,"Zhang, TC; Lin, YC; Sun, NN; Liu, S; Hu, WZ; Zhao, Y; Dong, XH; He, XP"
Optical Imaging Demonstrates Tissue-Specific Metabolic Perturbations in Mblac1 Knockout Mice.,"Metabolic changes have been extensively documented in neurodegenerative brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mutations in the C. elegans swip-10 gene result in dopamine (DA) dependent motor dysfunction accompanied by DA neuron degeneration. Recently, the putative human ortholog of swip-10 (MBLAC1) was implicated as a risk factor in AD, a disorder that, like PD, has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, the AD risk associated with MBLAC1 arises in subjects with cardiovascular morbidity, suggesting a broader functional insult arising from reduced MBLAC1 protein expression and one possibly linked to metabolic alterations.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; MBLAC1; metabolic syndrome; optical metabolic imaging; redox state,"Animals; Female; Humans; Mice; Male; Aged; Mice, Knockout; Caenorhabditis elegans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; NAD; Dopaminergic Neurons; Optical Imaging","Ceyhan, B; Nategh, P; Neghabi, M; LaMar, JA; Konjalwar, S; Rodriguez, P; Hahn, MK; Gross, M; Grumbar, G; Salleng, KJ; Blakely, RD; Ranji, M"
Osteocyte-derived sclerostin impairs cognitive function during ageing and Alzheimer's disease progression.,"Ageing increases susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Serum levels of sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived Wnt-β-catenin signalling antagonist, increase with age and inhibit osteoblastogenesis. As Wnt-β-catenin signalling acts as a protective mechanism for memory, we hypothesize that osteocyte-derived sclerostin can impact cognitive function under pathological conditions. Here we show that osteocyte-derived sclerostin can cross the blood-brain barrier of old mice, where it can dysregulate Wnt-β-catenin signalling. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that abnormally elevated osteocyte-derived sclerostin impairs synaptic plasticity and memory in old mice of both sexes. Mechanistically, sclerostin increases amyloid β (Aβ) production through β-catenin-β-secretase 1 (BACE1) signalling, indicating a functional role for sclerostin in AD. Accordingly, high sclerostin levels in patients with AD of both sexes are associated with severe cognitive impairment, which is in line with the acceleration of Αβ production in an AD mouse model with bone-specific overexpression of sclerostin. Thus, we demonstrate osteocyte-derived sclerostin-mediated bone-brain crosstalk, which could serve as a target for developing therapeutic interventions against AD.",2024,,Humans; Male; Female; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Osteocytes; beta Catenin; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Cognition; Aging,"Shi, T; Shen, S; Shi, Y; Wang, Q; Zhang, G; Lin, J; Chen, J; Bai, F; Zhang, L; Wang, Y; Gong, W; Shao, X; Chen, G; Yan, W; Chen, X; Ma, Y; Zheng, L; Qin, J; Lu, K; Liu, N; Xu, Y; Shi, YS; Jiang, Q; Guo, B"
Beyond CSF and Neuroimaging Assessment: Evaluating Plasma miR-145-5p as a Potential Biomarker for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. New strategies for the early detection of MCI and sporadic AD are crucial for developing effective treatment options. Current techniques used for diagnosis of AD are invasive and/or expensive, so they are not suitable for population screening. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers such as amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) levels are core biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. Several studies have proposed the use of blood-circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential novel early biomarkers for AD. We therefore applied a novel approach to identify blood-circulating miRNAs associated with CSF biomarkers and explored the potential of these miRNAs as biomarkers of AD. In total, 112 subjects consisting of 28 dementia due to AD cases, 63 MCI due to AD cases, and 21 cognitively healthy controls were included. We identified seven Aβ1-42-associated plasma miRNAs, six P-tau181-associated plasma miRNAs, and nine Aβ1-42-associated serum miRNAs. These miRNAs were involved in AD-relevant biological processes, such as PI3K/AKT signaling. Based on this signaling pathway, we constructed an miRNA-gene target network, wherein miR-145-5p has been identified as a hub. Furthermore, we showed that miR-145-5p performs best in the prediction of both AD and MCI. Moreover, miR-145-5p also improved the prediction performance of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. The performance of this miRNA was validated using different datasets including an RT-qPCR dataset from plasma samples of 23 MCI cases and 30 age-matched controls. These findings indicate that blood-circulating miRNAs that are associated with CSF biomarkers levels and specifically plasma miR-145-5p alone or combined with the MMSE score can potentially be used as noninvasive biomarkers for AD or MCI screening in the general population, although studies in other AD cohorts are necessary for further validation.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; PI3K/AKT signaling; biomarkers; miR-145; microRNAs,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Cognitive Dysfunction; MicroRNAs; Biomarkers; Neuroimaging; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Wen, Q; Wittens, MMJ; Engelborghs, S; van Herwijnen, MHM; Tsamou, M; Roggen, E; Smeets, B; Krauskopf, J; Briedé, JJ"
Serum amyloid beta 42 levels correlated with metabolic syndrome and its components.,"Beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain appears to be a key initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and factors associated with increased deposition of beta-amyloid are of great interest. Enhanced deposition of amyloid-β peptides is due to an imbalance between their production and elimination. Previous studies show that diminished levels of CSF amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) is a biomarker in AD; however, the role of serum Aβ42 in AD is contradictory. BMI and obesity have been reported to be related to increased serum Aβ42 levels. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relation between metabolic syndrome (MetS), its clinical measures (abdominal obesity, high glucose, high triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and hypertension), and serum Aβ42 levels.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); blood lipids; blood pressure; body mass index (BMI); metabolic syndrome; serum amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42),"Humans; Aged, 80 and over; Metabolic Syndrome; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Obesity; Alzheimer Disease; Triglycerides; Lipoproteins, HDL; Biomarkers; Glucose","Li, K; Zhou, X; Liu, Y; Li, D; Li, Y; Zhang, T; Fu, C; Li, L; Hu, Y; Jiang, L"

Freestanding Nanofiber-Assembled Aptasensor for Precisely and Ultrafast Electrochemical Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers.,"Amyloid beta-protein (AβAβ) is a main hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a low amount of Aβ protein accumulation appears to be a potential marker for AD. Here, an electrochemical DNA biosensor based on polyamide/polyaniline carbon nanotubes (PA/PANI-CNTs) is developed with the aim of diagnosing AD early using a simple, low-cost, and accessible method to rapidly detect Aβ42 in human blood. Electrospun PA nanofibers served as the skeleton for the successive in situ deposition of PANI and CNTs, which contribute both high conductivity and abundant binding sites for the Aβ42 aptamers. After the aptamers are immobilized, this aptasensor exhibits precise and specific detection of Aβ42 in human blood within only 4 min with an extremely fast response rate, lower detection limit, and excellent linear detection range. These findings make a significant contribution to advancing the development of serum-based detection techniques for Aβ42, thereby paving the way for improved diagnostic capabilities in the field of AD.",2024,Alzheimer's; electrochemical aptasensors; electrospun nanofibers; real serum detection; ultrasensitive trace Aβ42 assay,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Nanofibers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biosensing Techniques; Electrochemical Techniques; Biomarkers; Nanotubes, Carbon; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Aniline Compounds; Limit of Detection; Peptide Fragments; Nylons","Liu, H; Yuan, X; Liu, T; Zhang, W; Dong, H; Chu, Z"
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 serum levels in frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) impedes brain plasmin synthesis. Reduced plasmin activity facilitates cumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since plasmin also regulates the synaptic activity, it is possible that altered PAI-1 is present in other neurodegenerative disorders. We investigated whether PAI-1 and its counter-regulatory tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are altered in serum of patients with dementia due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Thirty five FTLD patients (21 in mild cognitive impairment stage (MCI) and 14 in dementia stage) and 10 cognitively healthy controls were recruited. Serum tPA and PAI-1 protein levels were measured by anova. Correlation between biochemical and demographic data were explored by measuring Pearson correlation coefficient. Serum PAI-1 levels were elevated in the FTLD dementia group as compared to FTLD MCI and controls. tPA serum levels and PAI-1/tPA ratio did not significantly differ among groups. There was a negative correlation between PAI-1 serum levels and disease severity measured by MMSE score. No correlations of tPA serum levels and PAI-1/tPA ratio with MMSE were found. Increased PAI-1 serum levels may serve as a marker of dementia in FTLD, suggesting that, besides Aβ pathway, the plasmin system may affect cognition through synaptic activity.",2024,dementia; frontotemporal lobar degeneration; plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; tissue-type plasminogen activator,,"Angelucci, F; Veverova, K; Katonová, A; Vyhnalek, M; Hort, J"

Up-regulation of lncRNA WT1-AS ameliorates Aβ-stimulated neuronal injury through modulation of miR-186-5p/CCND2 axis in Alzheimer's disease.,"As a common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD) seriously threatens human life. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit essential functions in AD development. Nevertheless, the detailed effects and possible mechanisms of lncRNA Wilms tumor 1 Antisense RNA (WT1-AS) in AD are largely unknown. In our studies, a total of 30 serum samples from AD patients were collected, and WT1-AS expressions were detected through qRT-PCR analysis. Additionally, an in vitro AD model was constructed by treating Aβ1-42 in human neuroblastoma cells. Functional assays were implemented to assess the impacts of WT1-AS on Aβ1-42-stimulated human neuroblastoma cell proliferation together with apoptosis. Moreover, relationship of WT1-AS, microRNA (miR)-186-5p as well as cyclin D2 (CCND2) could be predicted through bioinformatics tools as well as proved via dual-luciferase reporter experiments. Our results showed that WT1-AS together with CCND2 were low-expressed, while miR-186-5p presented high expression in AD serum samples together with Aβ1-42-stimulated human neuroblastoma cells. WT1-AS over-expression or miR-186-5p depletion notably promoted the proliferation, reduced the apoptosis, and decreased the p-Tau protein expressions of human neuroblastoma cells induced with Aβ1-42. Moreover, miR-186-5p combined with WT1-AS, and CCND2 was modulated by miR-186-5p. Furthermore, CCND2 elevation partially offsets the impacts of miR-186-5p elevation on Aβ1-42-stimulated cell proliferation as well as apoptosis mediated with WT1-AS up-regulation. Our results indicated that up-regulation of lncRNA WT1-AS ameliorated Aβ-stimulated neuronal damage through modulating miR-186-5p/CCND2 axis, offering a novel direction for AD therapy.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Apoptosis; Cyclin D2; MicroRNAs; Neuroblastoma; RNA, Long Noncoding; Up-Regulation","Tang, Y; Zhang, X; Wang, S; Liu, L; Wang, Q; Liu, Y; Yu, Y; Zhai, Q"
Cognitively healthy APOE4/4 carriers show white matter impairment associated with serum NfL and amyloid-PET.,"Except for aging, carrying the APOE ε4 allele (APOE4) is the most important risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. APOE4 carriers may have reduced capacity to recycle lipids, resulting in white matter microstructural abnormalities. In this study, we evaluated whether white matter impairment measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) differs between healthy individuals with a different number of APOE4 alleles, and whether white matter impairment associates with brain beta-amyloid (Aβ) load and serum levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL). We studied 96 participants (APOE3/3, N = 37; APOE3/4, N = 39; APOE4/4, N = 20; mean age 70.7 (SD 5.22) years, 63% females) with a brain MRI including a DTI sequence (N = 96), Aβ-PET (N = 89) and a venous blood sample for the serum NfL concentration measurement (N = 88). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AxD) in six a priori-selected white matter regions-of-interest (ROIs) were compared between the groups using ANCOVA, with sex and age as covariates. A voxel-weighted average of FA, MD, RD and AxD was calculated for each subject, and correlations with Aβ-PET and NfL levels were evaluated. APOE4/4 carriers exhibited a higher MD and a higher RD in the body of corpus callosum than APOE3/4 (p = 0.0053 and p = 0.0049, respectively) and APOE3/3 (p = 0.026 and p = 0.042). APOE4/4 carriers had a higher AxD than APOE3/4 (p = 0.012) and APOE3/3 (p = 0.040) in the right cingulum adjacent to cingulate cortex. In the total sample, composite MD, RD and AxD positively correlated with the cortical Aβ load (r = 0.26 to 0.33, p < 0.013 for all) and with serum NfL concentrations (r = 0.31 to 0.36, p < 0.0028 for all). In conclusion, increased local diffusivity was detected in cognitively unimpaired APOE4/4 homozygotes compared to APOE3/4 and APOE3/3 carriers, and increased diffusivity correlated with biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration. White matter impairment seems to be an early phenomenon in the Alzheimer's disease pathologic process in APOE4/4 homozygotes.",2024,APOE; Alzheimer's disease; Apolipoprotein E; DTI; Diffusion tensor imaging; MRI; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurofilament light chain; Positron emission tomography; [(11)C]PiB,Female; Humans; Aged; Male; White Matter; Apolipoprotein E4; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E3; Brain,"Tato-Fernández, C; Ekblad, LL; Pietilä, E; Saunavaara, V; Helin, S; Parkkola, R; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Rinne, JO; Snellman, A"
A dual-signal amplification strategy based on rolling circle amplification and APE1-assisted amplification for highly sensitive and specific miRNA analysis for early diagnosis of alzheimer's disease.,"MicroRNA (miRNA) is involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and emerges as a promising AD biomarker and therapeutic target. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop convenient and precise miRNA detection methods for AD diagnosis. Herein, a dual-signal amplification strategy based on rolling circle amplification and APE1-assisted amplification for miRNA analysis for early diagnosis of AD was proposed. The strategy consisted of dumbbell-shaped probe (DP) as amplification template and a reporter probe (RP) with an AP site modification. In the presence of the target miRNA, the miRNAs bound to the toehold domain of DP and DP was activated into a circular template. Then, RCA reaction was triggered, producing a large number of long-stranded products containing repeated sequences. After RCA, APE1 enzyme recognized and removed AP site in the complex of RCA/RP products. By coupling RCA with APE1-assisted amplification, this method has high sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) of 1.82 fM.

"COP-22 Alleviates D-Galactose-Induced Brain Aging by Attenuating Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Apoptosis in Mice.","Aging is a natural and inevitable process of organisms. With the intensification of population aging, research on aging has become a hot topic of global attention. The most obvious manifestation of human aging is the aging of brain function, which has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, COP-22, a mono-carbonyl curcumin derivative, was evaluated for its anti-aging ability, especially its ability to resist brain aging induced by D-galactose (D-gal) in mice. For brain protection, COP-22 could resist D-gal-induced oxidative stress by increasing the activity of antioxidative defense enzymes and enhancing antioxidant capacity in the brain tissue; COP-22 could improve the dysfunction of the cholinergic system by decreasing the increased activity of acetylcholinesterase and increasing the reduced content of acetylcholine induced by D-gal; and COP-22 could protect nerve cells of the brain. Further, western blot was used to determine related proteins of the brain. We found that COP-22 could effectively protect against brain injury (SIRT1, p53, p21, and p16) by inhibiting oxidative stress (Nrf2 and HO-1), inflammation (IL-6 and TNF-α), and apoptosis (Bax and caspase-3) in D-gal-induced aging mice. Additionally, COP-22 demonstrated the ability to reduce oxidative stress in serum and liver caused by D-gal, as well as relieve the damages in the liver and kidney induced by D-gal. These results indicated that COP-22 had potential anti-aging activity and could be used in the therapy of aging and aging-associated diseases like Alzheimer disease.",2024,Anti-aging; Apoptosis; Brain aging; COP-22; Curcumin derivative; Inflammation; Oxidative stress,,"Ma, Y; Wang, X; Li, X; Chen, X; Teng, Z; Wang, X; Yang, J; Liu, G"
Overexpression of forebrain PTP1B leads to synaptic and cognitive impairments in obesity.,"Obesity has reached pandemic proportions and is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Chronic inflammation is common in obese patients, but the mechanism between inflammation and cognitive impairment in obesity remains unclear. Accumulative evidence shows that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a neuroinflammatory and negative synaptic regulator, is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative processes. We investigated the causal role of PTP1B in obesity-induced cognitive impairment and the beneficial effect of PTP1B inhibitors in counteracting impairments of cognition, neural morphology, and signaling. We showed that obese individuals had negative relationship between serum PTP1B levels and cognitive function. Furthermore, the PTP1B level in the forebrain increased in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and obese cognitive impairment mice with the expansion of white matter, neuroinflammation and brain atrophy. PTP1B globally or forebrain-specific knockout mice on an obesogenic high-fat diet showed enhanced cognition and improved synaptic ultrastructure and proteins in the forebrain. Specifically, deleting PTP1B in leptin receptor-expressing cells improved leptin synaptic signaling and increased BDNF expression in the forebrain of obese mice. Importantly, we found that various PTP1B allosteric inhibitors (e.g., MSI-1436, well-tolerated in Phase 1 and 1b clinical trials for obesity and type II diabetes) prevented these alterations, including improving cognition, neurite outgrowth, leptin synaptic signaling and BDNF in both obese cognitive impairment mice and a neural cell model of PTP1B overexpression. These findings suggest that increased forebrain PTP1B is associated with cognitive decline in obesity, whereas inhibition of PTP1B could be a promising strategy for preventing neurodegeneration induced by obesity.",2024,Cognition; Forebrain; Obesity; PTP1B; Synapse,"Animals; Humans; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Inflammation; Leptin; Obesity","Ge, X; Hu, M; Zhou, M; Fang, X; Chen, X; Geng, D; Wang, L; Yang, X; An, H; Zhang, M; Lin, D; Zheng, M; Cui, X; Wang, Q; Wu, Y; Zheng, K; Huang, XF; Yu, Y"
Emerging functions and therapeutic targets of IL-38 in central nervous system diseases.,"Interleukin (IL)-38 is a newly discovered cytokine of the IL-1 family, which binds various receptors (i.e., IL-36R, IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1, and IL-1R1) in the central nervous system (CNS). The hallmark physiological function of IL-38 is competitive binding to IL-36R, as does the IL-36R antagonist. Emerging research has shown that IL-38 is abnormally expressed in the serum and brain tissue of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting that IL-38 may play an important role in neurological diseases. Important advances include that IL-38 alleviates neuromyelitis optica disorder (NMOD) by inhibiting Th17 expression, improves IS by protecting against atherosclerosis via regulating immune cells and inflammation, and reduces IL-1β and CXCL8 release through inhibiting human microglial activity post-ASD. In contrast, IL-38 mRNA is markedly increased and is mainly expressed in phagocytes in spinal cord injury (SCI). IL-38 ablation attenuated SCI by reducing immune cell infiltration. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of IL-38 in CNS diseases remain inadequately characterized. In this review, we summarize the biological characteristics, pathophysiological role, and potential mechanisms of IL-38 in CNS diseases (e.g., NMOD, Alzheimer's disease, ASD, IS, TBI, and SCI), aiming to explore the therapeutic potential of IL-38 in the prevention and treatment of CNS diseases.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; IL-36R; IL-38; autism spectrum disorder; ischemic stroke; neuromyelitis optica disorder; spinal cord injury; traumatic brain injury,Humans; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Cytokines; Spinal Cord Injuries; Microglia; Neuromyelitis Optica; Interleukins,"Gao, Y; Cai, L; Wu, Y; Jiang, M; Zhang, Y; Ren, W; Song, Y; Li, L; Lei, Z; Wu, Y; Zhu, L; Li, J; Li, D; Li, G; Luo, C; Tao, L"

Effects and mechanisms of bisphenols exposure on neurodegenerative diseases risk: A systemic review.,"Environmental bisphenols (BPs) pose a global threat to human health because of their extensive use as additives in plastic products. BP residues are increasing in various environmental media (i.e., water, soil, and indoor dust) and biological and human samples (i.e., serum and brain). Both epidemiological and animal studies have determined an association between exposure to BPs and an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), including cognitive abnormalities and behavioral disturbances. Hence, understanding the biological responses to different BPs is essential for prevention, and treatment. This study provides an overview of the underlying pathogenic molecular mechanisms as a valuable basis for understanding neurodegenerative disease responses to BPs, including accumulation of misfolded proteins, reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine, abnormal hormone signaling, neuronal death, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, and inflammation. These findings provide new insights into the neurotoxic potential of BPs and ultimately contribute to a comprehensive health risk evaluation.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Bisphenols; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurotoxicity; Parkinson's disease,Animals; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Brain; Oxidative Stress,"Xu, Y; Nie, J; Lu, C; Hu, C; Chen, Y; Ma, Y; Huang, Y; Lu, L"
Sex-dependent association of serum uric acid levels with amyloid accumulation among amyloid-positive older adults.,"We aimed to examine the potential effect of sex on the longitudinal association of baseline serum uric acid levels with brain amyloid accumulation over time among older adults with and without abnormal amyloid. At baseline, the study sample comprised 499 older adults, including 276 men and 223 women. Linear mixed-effects regression models were fitted to estimate the individual slopes of change in brain amyloid accumulation [as measured by AV45 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)] over time. At baseline, we did not observe a relationship between serum uric acid levels and brain amyloid deposition in women or men regardless of amyloid status. Among amyloid negative subjects, women and men did not differ in the relationship between baseline serum uric acid and the annual change in amyloid accumulation in subjects with normal amyloid levels. In amyloid positive women, serum uric acid levels were not associated with the annual change in amyloid accumulation (unstandardized β = 0.0005, SE = 0.0006, p value = 0.4179). However, in amyloid positive men, serum uric acid levels were negatively associated with the annual change in amyloid accumulation (unstandardized β = -0.0015, SE = 0.0005, p value = 0.0048). These findings support a potential sex-specific effect on the relationship between serum uric acid levels and amyloid accumulation among amyloid positive older adults.",2024,,Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Uric Acid; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid; Brain; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Zhao, G; Guan, J"

Maternal history of Alzheimer's disease predisposes to altered serum cholesterol levels in adult offspring.,"Controversial findings regarding the association between serum cholesterol levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified through observational studies. The genetic basis shared by both factors and the causality between them remain largely unknown. The objective of this study is to examine the causal impact of maternal history of AD on changes in serum cholesterol levels in adult offspring. By retrieving genetic variants from summary statistics of large-scale genome-wide association study of maternal history of AD (European-based: Ncase = 27 696, Ncontrol = 260 980). The causal association between genetically predicted maternal history of AD and changes in serum cholesterol levels in adult offspring was examined using the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method. Causal impact estimates were calculated using single-nucleotide polymorphisms in both univariable MR (UMR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses. Additionally, other approaches, such as Cochran's Q test and leave-one-out variant analysis, were employed to correct for potential biases. The results of UMR presented that genetically predicted maternal history of AD was positively associated with hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1.014; 95% CI: 1.009-1.018; p < 0.001), total cholesterol (OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.134-1.466; p < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein (OR = 1.525; 95% CI: 1.272-1.828; p < 0.001) among adult offspring. Genetic predisposition for maternal history of AD to be negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein (OR = 0.889; 95% CI: 0.861-0.917; p < 0.001). The MVMR analysis remained robust and significant after adjusting for diabetes and obesity in offspring. Sufficient evidence was provided in this study to support the putative causal impact of maternal history of AD on the change of serum cholesterol profile in adult offspring. In clinical practice, priority should be given to the detection and monitoring of cholesterol levels in individuals with a maternal history of AD, particularly in the early stages.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Mendelian randomization; causal inference; cholesterol; family history,"Adult; Humans; Adult Children; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Cholesterol","Liang, Y; Deng, MG; Jian, Q; Liu, M; Fang, K; Chen, S"
Investigating metabolic dysregulation in serum of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice: implications for pathogenesis and potential biomarkers.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that lacks convenient and accessible peripheral blood diagnostic markers and effective drugs. Metabolic dysfunction is one of AD risk factors, which leaded to alterations of various metabolites in the body. Pathological changes of the brain can be reflected in blood metabolites that are expected to explain the disease mechanisms or be candidate biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of targeted metabolites within peripheral blood of AD mouse model, with the purpose of exploring the disease mechanism and potential biomarkers. Targeted metabolomics was used to quantify 256 metabolites in serum of triple transgenic AD (3 × Tg-AD) male mice. Compared with controls, 49 differential metabolites represented dysregulation in purine, pyrimidine, tryptophan, cysteine and methionine and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Among them, adenosine, serotonin, N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, and acetylcholine play a key role in regulating neural transmitter network. The alteration of S-adenosine-L-homocysteine, S-adenosine-L-methionine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide in AD mice serum can served as indicator of AD risk. The results revealed the changes of metabolites in serum, suggesting that metabolic dysregulation in periphery in AD mice may be related to the disturbances in neuroinhibition, the serotonergic system, sleep function, the cholinergic system, and the gut microbiota. This study provides novel insights into the dysregulation of several key metabolites and metabolic pathways in AD, presenting potential avenues for future research and the development of peripheral biomarkers.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarker; Serum; Target metabolomics; Triple-transgenic AD mice,"Animals; Male; Mice; Adenosine; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Metabolomics; Mice, Transgenic; Neurodegenerative Diseases; S-Adenosylhomocysteine","Zhuang, H; Cao, X; Tang, X; Zou, Y; Yang, H; Liang, Z; Yan, X; Chen, X; Feng, X; Shen, L"
Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.,"Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic 'bioenergetic capacity' as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.",2024,,,"Arnold, M; Buyukozkan, M; Doraiswamy, PM; Nho, K; Wu, T; Gudnason, V; Launer, LJ; Wang-Sattler, R; Adamski, J; De Jager, PL; Ertekin-Taner, N; Bennett, DA; Saykin, AJ; Peters, A; Suhre, K; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Kastenmüller, G; Krumsiek, J"

In this work, we design the directional growth of Ti-metal-organic frameworks on polar-functionalized magnetic particles. This design facilitates the rapid synergistic capture of exosomes with the assistance of an external magnetic field and additionally synergistically enhances the ionization of their metabolites during mass spectrometry detection. Benefiting from this dual synergistic effect, we identified three high-performance exosome metabolites through the differential comparison of a large number of serum samples from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal cognition. Notably, the accuracy of AD identification ranges from 93.18 to 100% using a single exosome metabolite and reaches a flawless 100% with three metabolites.

Gut microbiota-driven metabolic alterations reveal gut-brain communication in Alzheimer's disease model mice.,"The gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites affect the host nervous system and are involved in the pathogeneses of various neurological diseases. However, the specific GM alterations under pathogenetic pressure and their contributions to the ""microbiota - metabolite - brain axis"" in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. Here, we investigated the GM and the fecal, serum, cortical metabolomes in APP/PS1 and wild-type (WT) mice, revealing distinct hub bacteria in AD mice within scale-free GM networks shared by both groups.

Serum Brevican as a Biomarker of Cerebrovascular Disease in an Elderly Cognitively Impaired Cohort.,"In the brain, the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition shapes the neuronal microenvironment and can undergo substantial changes with cerebral pathology. Brevican is integral to the formation of the ECM's neuroprotective perineuronal nets (PNNs). Decreased brevican levels were reported in vascular dementia (VaD) but not in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the status of brevican in clinical cohorts with high concomitance of AD pathological burden and cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) is unclear. In this study, 32 non-cognitively impaired (NCI), 97 cognitively impaired no dementia (CIND), 46 AD, and 23 VaD participants recruited from memory clinics based in Singapore underwent neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessments, together with measurements of serum brevican. Association analyses were performed between serum brevican and neuroimaging measures of CeVDs, including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, cortical infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds.

"Role of Natural Compounds Modulating Heme Catabolic Pathway in Gut, Liver, Cardiovascular, and Brain Diseases.","The crucial physiological process of heme breakdown yields biliverdin (BV) and bilirubin (BR) as byproducts. BV, BR, and the enzymes involved in their production (the ""yellow players-YP"") are increasingly documented as endogenous modulators of human health. Mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentration has been correlated with a reduced risk of multiple chronic pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory diseases, especially in the elderly. BR and BV per se have been demonstrated to protect against neurodegenerative diseases, in which heme oxygenase (HMOX), the main enzyme in the production of pigments, is almost always altered. HMOX upregulation has been interpreted as a tentative defense against the ongoing pathologic mechanisms. With the demonstration that multiple cells possess YP, their propensity to be modulated, and their broad spectrum of activity on multiple signaling pathways, the YP have assumed the role of an adjustable system that can promote health in adults. Based on that, there is an ongoing effort to induce their activity as a therapeutic option, and natural compounds are an attractive alternative to the goal, possibly requiring only minimal changes in the life style.

Oxidative stress is associated with Aβ accumulation in chronic sleep deprivation model.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation is the main pathological change in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which results from the imbalance of production and clearance of Aβ in the brain. Our previous study found that chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) led to the deposition of Aβ in the brain by disrupting the balance of Aβ production and clearance, but the specific mechanism was not clear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of oxidative stress on Aβ accumulation in CSD rats. We found that the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly increased after CSD, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased in the brain. Furthermore, the serum ROS was elevated and SOD declined after CSD. The levels of oxidative stress in the brain were significantly correlated with β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), and receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) levels in hippocampus and prefrontal lobe, and the concentration of serum oxidative mediators were strongly correlated with plasma levels of soluble LRP1 (sLRP1) and soluble RAGE (sRAGE). These results suggested that the oxidative stress in the brain and serum may involved in the CSD-induced Aβ accumulation.

Age-Dependent and Aβ-Induced Dynamic Changes in the Subcellular Localization of HMGB1 in Neurons and Microglia in the Brains of an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"HMGB1 is a prototypical danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule that co-localizes with amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. HMGB1 levels are significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. However, the cellular and subcellular distribution of HMGB1 in relation to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease has not yet been studied in detail. Here, we investigated whether HMGB1 protein levels in brain tissue homogenates (frontal cortex and striatum) and sera from Tg-APP/PS1 mice, along with its cellular and subcellular localization in those regions, differed. Total HMGB1 levels were increased in the frontal cortices of aged wildtype (7.5 M) mice compared to young (3.5 M) mice, whereas total HMGB1 levels in the frontal cortices of Tg-APP/PS1 mice (7.5 M) were significantly lower than those in age-matched wildtype mice. In contrast, total serum HMGB1 levels were enhanced in aged wildtype (7.5 M) mice and Tg-APP/PS1 mice (7.5 M). Further analysis indicated that nuclear HMGB1 levels in the frontal cortices of Tg-APP/PS1 mice were significantly reduced compared to those in age-matched wildtype controls, and cytosolic HMGB1 levels were also significantly decreased. Triple-fluorescence immunohistochemical analysis indicated that HMGB1 appeared as a ring shape in the cytoplasm of most neurons and microglia in the frontal cortices of 9.5 M Tg-APP/PS1 mice, indicating that nuclear HMGB1 is reduced by aging and in Tg-APP/PS1 mice. Consistent with these observations, Aβ treatment of both primary cortical neuron and primary microglial cultures increased HMGB1 secretion in the media, in an Aβ-dose-dependent manner. Our results indicate that nuclear HMGB1 might be translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in both neurons and microglia in the brains of Tg-APP/PS1 mice, and that it may subsequently be secreted extracellularly.",2024,AD; Aβ; HMGB1; aging; frontal cortex,"Aged; Animals; Humans; Mice; Alarmins; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; HMGB1 Protein; Microglia; Neurons; Disease Models, Animal","Seol, SI; Davaanyam, D; Oh, SA; Lee, EH; Han, PL; Kim, SW; Lee, JK"

Reconsidering repurposing: long-term metformin treatment impairs cognition in Alzheimer's model mice.,"Metformin, a primary anti-diabetic medication, has been anticipated to provide benefits for Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known as ""type 3 diabetes"". Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated that metformin may trigger AD pathology and even elevate AD risk in humans. Despite this, limited research has elucidated the behavioral outcomes of metformin treatment, which would hold significant translational value. Thus, we aimed to perform thorough behavioral research on the prolonged administration of metformin to mice: We administered metformin (300 mg/kg/day) to transgenic 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic (NT) C57BL/6 mice over 1 and 2 years, respectively, and evaluated their behaviors across multiple domains via touchscreen operant chambers, including motivation, attention, memory, visual discrimination, and cognitive flexibility. We found metformin enhanced attention, inhibitory control, and associative learning in younger NT mice (≤16 months). However, chronic treatment led to impairments in memory retention and discrimination learning at older age. Furthermore, metformin caused learning and memory impairment and increased levels of AMPKα1-subunit, β-amyloid oligomers, plaques, phosphorylated tau, and GSK3β expression in AD mice. No changes in potential confounding factors on cognition, including levels of motivation, locomotion, appetite, body weight, blood glucose, and serum vitamin B12, were observed in metformin-treated AD mice. We also identified an enhanced amyloidogenic pathway in db/db mice, as well as in Neuro2a-APP",2024,,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Metformin; tau Proteins; Drug Repositioning; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mice, Transgenic; Cognition; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Cho, SY; Kim, EW; Park, SJ; Phillips, BU; Jeong, J; Kim, H; Heath, CJ; Kim, D; Jang, Y; López-Cruz, L; Saksida, LM; Bussey, TJ; Lee, DY; Kim, E"
Alzheimer's disease early diagnostic and staging biomarkers revealed by large-scale cerebrospinal fluid and serum proteomic profiling.,"Amyloid-β, tau pathology, and biomarkers of neurodegeneration make up the core diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, these proteins represent only a fraction of the complex biological processes underlying AD, and individuals with other brain diseases in which AD pathology is a comorbidity also test positive for these diagnostic biomarkers. More AD-specific early diagnostic and disease staging biomarkers are needed. In this study, we performed tandem mass tag proteomic analysis of paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples in a discovery cohort comprising 98 participants. Candidate biomarkers were validated by parallel reaction monitoring-based targeted proteomic assays in an independent multicenter cohort comprising 288 participants. We quantified 3,238 CSF and 1,702 serum proteins in the discovery cohort, identifying 171 and 860 CSF proteins and 37 and 323 serum proteins as potential early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. In the validation cohort, 58 and 21 CSF proteins, as well as 12 and 18 serum proteins, were verified as early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. Separate 19-protein CSF and an 8-protein serum biomarker panels were built by machine learning to accurately classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD from normal cognition with areas under the curve of 0.984 and 0.881, respectively. The 19-protein CSF biomarker panel also effectively discriminated patients with MCI due to AD from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we identified 21 CSF and 18 serum stage-associated proteins reflecting AD stages.

In this work, we provided a strategy to address this issue by constructing a combinatorial biomarker of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NFL). To achieve the convenient and sensitive detection of two proteins, we developed an electrochemical immunosandwich sensor using two metal-ion-doped carbon dots (Pb-CDs and Cu-CDs) as probes for signal output.

Entropy-driven catalysis-based lateral flow assay for sensitive detection of Alzheimer 's-associated MicroRNA.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the brain worldwide. Currently, there is no effective cure. But accurate and early diagnosis of AD is critical to the development of patient care and future treatments. MiRNA-16 has been considered as an effective diagnostic biomarker for AD because of its regulatory effect on key proteins of AD. Herein, a colorimetric lateral flow assay (LFA) was developed for sensitive detection of miRNA-16 based on entropy-driven catalysis (EDC) amplification strategy. MiRNA-16 triggered EDC and released more linker DNAs (LDNA) of sandwich structure. Thus, AuNPs were enriched at the T-line to enhance the colorimetric signal and improve the sensitivity of visual assay. It showed good specificity and sensitivity for detecting miRNA-16 with a detection limit of 1.01 pM. The practical detection of miRNA-16 in human serum obtained satisfactory result. Significantly, EDC achieved signal amplification in homogeneous solution without enzyme and DNA labeling, leading to a cheap and easy detection of miRNA-16. Therefore, it provided a portable and rapid assay for AD-related nucleic acid, which holds a potential for point-of-care testing (POCT) of AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Entropy-driven catalysis; Lateral flow assay; MiRNA-16,Humans; MicroRNAs; Alzheimer Disease; Entropy; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; DNA; Catalysis; Limit of Detection; Biosensing Techniques; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques,"Wang, J; Shi, L; Zhu, X; Tang, Q; Wu, M; Li, B; Liu, W; Jin, Y"

Levels of 18 tryptophan-related neuroactive substances were determined by high throughput and sensitive ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in time-linked blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from 100 age-matched participants belonging to five cohorts: healthy volunteers (,2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; Tryptophan metabolic pathway; cerebrospinal fluid; neurodegenerative disease; serum,Humans; Tryptophan; Kynurenine; Serum; Alzheimer Disease; Tauopathies; Proteostasis Deficiencies; Biomarkers,"Kaleta, M; Hényková, E; Menšíková, K; Friedecký, D; Kvasnička, A; Klíčová, K; Koníčková, D; Strnad, M; Kaňovský, P; Novák, O"
Silica Nanoparticle Exposure Implicates β-Amyloid (1-42) Inbound and the Accelerating Alzheimer's Disease Progression in Mice Overexpressing Mutated Forms of Human Amyloid Precursor Protein and Presenilin 1 Genes.,"The increasing nanoparticle (NP) applications in the biomedical field have become an emerging concern regarding human health. NP exposure may play a role in the accelerating Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression; however, the etiology of this disorder is complex and remains largely unclear. Here, we identified that intravenous injection of silica NPs (SiNPs) caused the blood-brain barrier breakdown via downregulating tight junction-related gene expressions. Meanwhile, SiNPs upregulate the transport receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) that govern the β-amyloid (Aβ) influx to the brain; however, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) that controls the efflux of Aβ from the brain was not affected. Consequently, an increase in Aβ burden in the brain of SiNP-challenged APP/PS1 mice was found. Intriguingly, plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorbed on the surface of SiNPs partially relieves this effect. Using ApoE knockout (ApoE",2024,,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Presenilin-1; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoproteins E; Nanoparticles; Silicon Dioxide; Mice, Transgenic; Disease Models, Animal; Peptide Fragments","Wei, W; Sun, H; Yang, B; Zhu, C; Song, E; Song, Y"

"Metabolomics profiling reveals distinct, sex-specific signatures in the serum and brain metabolomes in the mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.",Increasing evidence suggests that metabolic impairments contribute to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) mechanisms and subsequent dementia. Signals in metabolic pathways conserved across species provides a promising entry point for translation. METHODS: We investigated differences of serum and brain metabolites between the early-onset 5XFAD and late-onset LOAD1 (APOE4.Trem2*R47H) mouse models of AD to C57BL/6J controls at six months of age.,2023,5XFAD; APOE4; Alzheimer’s disease; Metabolomics; animal models,,"Pandey, RS; Arnold, M; Batra, R; Krumsiek, J; Kotredes, KP; Garceau, D; Williams, H; Sasner, M; Howell, GR; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Carter, GW"
Elevated CSF angiopoietin-2 correlates with blood-brain barrier leakiness and markers of neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Breakdown of the neurovascular unit is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness contributing to cognitive decline and disease pathology in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular stability depends on angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT-1) signalling, antagonised by angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT-2) expressed upon endothelial injury. We examined the relationship between CSF ANGPT-2 and CSF markers of BBB leakiness and core AD biomarkers across three independent cohorts: (i) 31 AD patients and 33 healthy controls grouped according to their biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and Aβ42 < 550 pg/mL); (ii) 121 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research study (84 participants cognitively unimpaired (CU) enriched for a parental history of AD, 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 17 with AD); (iii) a neurologically normal cohort aged 23-78 years with paired CSF and serum samples. CSF ANGPT-2, sPDGFRβ, albumin and fibrinogen levels were measured by sandwich ELISA. In cohort (i), CSF ANGPT-2 was elevated in AD and correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau181 but not Aβ42. ANGPT-2 also correlated positively with CSF sPDGFRβ and fibrinogen - markers of pericyte injury and BBB leakiness. In cohort (ii), CSF ANGPT-2 was highest in MCI and correlated with CSF albumin in the CU and MCI cohorts but not in AD. CSF ANGPT-2 also correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau and with markers of neuronal injury (neurogranin and α-synuclein) and neuroinflammation (GFAP and YKL-40). In cohort (iii), CSF ANGPT-2 correlated strongly with the CSF/serum albumin ratio. Serum ANGPT-2 showed non-significant positive associations with CSF ANGPT-2 and the CSF/serum albumin ratio. Together, these data indicate that CSF and possibly serum ANGPT-2 is associated with BBB leakiness in early AD and is closely related to tau pathology and neuronal injury. The utility of serum ANGPT-2 as a biomarker of BBB damage in AD requires further study.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Angiopoietin-2; Biomarkers; Blood-Brain Barrier; Fibrinogen; Serum Albumin,"Van Hulle, C; Ince, S; Okonkwo, OC; Bendlin, BB; Johnson, SC; Carlsson, CM; Asthana, S; Love, S; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Scott Miners, J"

Copper and cuproptosis: new therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease.,"Copper (Cu) plays a crucial role as a trace element in various physiological processes in humans. Nonetheless, free copper ions accumulate in the brain over time, resulting in a range of pathological changes. Compelling evidence indicates that excessive free copper deposition contributes to cognitive decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Free copper levels in the serum and brain of AD patients are notably elevated, leading to reduced antioxidant defenses and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, free copper accumulation triggers a specific form of cell death, namely copper-dependent cell death (cuproptosis). This article aimed to review the correlation between copper dysregulation and the pathogenesis of AD, along with the primary pathways regulating copper homoeostasis and copper-induced death in AD. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of natural and synthetic agents, including copper chelators, lipid peroxidation inhibitors, and antioxidants, were examined. These treatments can restore copper equilibrium and prevent copper-induced cell death in AD cases. Another aim of this review was to highlight the significance of copper dysregulation and promote the development of pharmaceutical interventions to address it.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; chelators; copper; cuproptosis; long-term potentiation,,"Li, X; Chen, X; Gao, X"
Nanotechnology for microglial targeting and inhibition of neuroinflammation underlying Alzheimer's pathology.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to have a multifactorial etiology. The hallmark of AD is progressive neurodegeneration, which is characterized by the deepening loss of memory and a high mortality rate in the elderly. The neurodegeneration in AD is believed to be exacerbated following the intercoupled cascades of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, uncontrolled microglial activation, and neuroinflammation. Current therapies for AD are mostly designed to target the symptoms, with limited ability to address the mechanistic triggers for the disease.

Meta-analysis of the serum/plasma proteome identifies significant associations between COVID-19 with Alzheimer's/Parkinson's diseases.,"In recent years, we have seen the widespread devastations and serious health complications manifested by COVID-19 globally. Although we have effectively controlled the pandemic, uncertainties persist regarding its potential long-term effects, including prolonged neurological issues. To gain comprehensive insights, we conducted a meta-analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data retrieved from different studies with a total of 538 COVID-19 patients and 523 healthy controls. The meta-analysis revealed that top-enriched pathways were associated with neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Further analysis confirmed a direct correlation in the expression patterns of 24 proteins involved in Alzheimer's and 23 proteins in Parkinson's disease with COVID-19. Protein-protein interaction network and cluster analysis identified SNCA as a hub protein, a known biomarker for Parkinson's disease, in both AD and PD.

The long-term effects of heated tobacco product exposure on the central nervous system in a mouse model of prodromal Alzheimer's disease.,"Heated tobacco products (HTPs) have emerged as novel alternatives to conventional cigarettes (CCs), marketed by the tobacco industry as having a reduced potential for harm. Nevertheless, a significant dearth of information remains regarding the long-term effects of HTPs on the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we sought to shed light on the repercussions of prolonged exposure to HTPs on the CNS, employing a mouse model mimicking prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study entailed subjecting App knock-in mice to 16 weeks of HTP exposure, administered 5 days per week, with serum cotinine concentration serving as confirmation of HTP exposure within this model. Histological analysis, aimed at assessing amyloid pathology, unveiled a minimal impact attributable to HTPs. However, exploration of differentially expressed genes in the cerebral cortex, using unadjusted p values, indicated an association between HTP exposure and non-inflammatory pathways, specifically linked to neurohypophyseal and neuropeptide hormone activity within the CNS. Of note, similar results have already been observed after exposure to CCs in vivo. Our study not only contributes insights into the potential non-inflammatory effects of HTPs within the context of AD pathogenesis but also underscores the significance of continued research to comprehend the full scope of their impact on the CNS.",2024,,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Central Nervous System; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Tobacco Products; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems","Yamada, H; Yamazaki, Y; Takebayashi, Y; Yazawa, K; Sasanishi, M; Motoda, A; Nakamori, M; Morino, H; Takahashi, T; Maruyama, H"

Proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by ADAM10 promotes proliferation and migration via activating MAPKs pathway in tongue squamous cell carcinoma in vitro.,"APP, well-studied in the development of Alzheimer's disease, has been recently identified as the key gene correlated with TSCC. Here, we investigate the function of APP and its proteolytic cleavage by ADAM10 in the pathogenesis of TSCC. A total of 63 TSCC patients and 30 healthy controls were included and the results of IHC assay showed high expressions of ADAM10 and APP in TSCC tissues compared to paired para-carcinoma tissues. Interestingly, APP expression in TSCC patients was correlated with ADAM10 expression and their combined expression was related to the poor patients' survival. We found that APP was ɑ-cleaved in TSCC cells to form sAPPα, and the serum level of sAPPα but not sAPPβ in TSCC patients was higher than healthy controls. Both overexpression with full-length APP and sAPPα promoted TSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Downregulation of APP or ADAM10 by siRNA decreased the generation of sAPPα and inhibited the activity of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways, thereby reducing TSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Treatment with ERK1/2 or p38 agonist or sAPPα overexpression reversed the effects of APP or ADAM10 knockdown. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the pathogenic roles of APP cleaved by ADAM10 to activate ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in TSCC cells. Both high expressions of ADAM10 and APP were related to poor prognosis. Targeting APP cleaved by ADAM10 might be a potential strategy in TSCC treatment.",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Tongue Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; ADAM10 Protein; Cell Proliferation; Tongue; Cell Line, Tumor; Membrane Proteins; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases","Hong, Y; Wei, Z; Wang, Y"
UPLC-Q-TOF/MS based serum and urine metabolomics strategy to analyze the mechanism of nervonic acid in treating Alzheimer's disease.,"Nervonic acid is a natural component of breast milk and is frequently used as a food additive due to its excellent neuroprotective effects. Although it has been reported that nervonic acid may play a role in the recovery of human cognitive impairment, its specific mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, the results of serum biochemical indexes showed that nervonic acid improved inflammation and reduced amyloid β peptide (Aβ) deposition and tau protein phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. Subsequently, we further used a metabolomics approach to investigate the potential mechanism of action of nervonic acid in the treatment of AD. The results of serum and urine metabolomics study showed that the intervention of nervonic acid significantly reversed the metabolic profile disorder in AD rats. A total of 52 metabolites were identified. They mainly involved linoleic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism, and all these metabolic pathways were associated with the emergence of inflammation in vivo. It suggests that the therapeutic effect of nervonic acid on AD is likely to be produced by ameliorating inflammation. The results obtained in this study provide new insights into the mechanism of nervonic acid treatment of AD and lay a foundation for the clinical application of nervonic acid in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Inflammation; Metabolomics; Nervonic acid; Unsaturate fatty acid,"Humans; Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Metabolomics; Inflammation; Biomarkers; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated","Chen, Z; Liu, S; Zhou, H; Wang, M; Pei, S; Wang, R; Liu, Z"

Signature of paraoxonases in the altered redox homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease.,"Paraoxonase (PON) enzymes (PON1, PON2 and PON3) exert antioxidant properties through arylesterase, lactonase and paraoxonase activities. Increasing findings suggested their potential involvement, particularly PON1 and PON2, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative pathology characterized by early oxidative stress. Specifically, decreased serum PON1-arylesterase and lactonase activities seem to be associated with an increased brain oxidative damage in early AD, leading to hypothesize that PON activity alterations might be an early event in AD. To address this hypothesis, the levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE; i.e. a marker of oxidative stress damage) along with the protein expression and enzymatic activity of PON1 and PON2 have been investigated in the brain and serum of young [Postnatal day (PD)8-10, 20-25 and 60-65] asymptomatic 3xTg-AD female mice, one of the most used transgenic models of AD. At PD 8-10, there were no differences in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) 4-HNE expression levels between 3xTg-AD mice compared to controls (Non-Tg mice). On the other hand, significant increased levels of 4-HNE were detected in PD 20-30 3xTg-AD mice hippocampus, while a significant reduction was observed in 3xTg-AD group at PD 60-65. In the PFC, 4-HNE levels were significantly reduced in 3xTg-AD mice brain at PD 20-30, while no differences in 4-HNE levels were detected at PD 60-65. No significant differences in arylesterase and lactonase activities were observed in the plasma of 3xTg-AD and Non-Tg mice at the different considered ages. Compared to Non-Tg mice, a reduction of brain arylesterase activity was found in 3xTg-AD female at PD 20-30 and PD 60-65, but it was significant only in the younger group. Finally, a similar trend was observed also for PON1 and PON2 protein levels, with both significantly, and solely, decreased in 3xTg-AD mice brain at PD 20-30. Overall, these findings suggest that the altered oxidative stress homeostasis in the 3xTg-AD female mice may be related to an early reduction in activity and expression of PONs enzymes most likely via a reduced brain arylesterases activity.",2024,4-Hydroxynonenal; Oxidative stress; Paraoxonase 1; Paraoxonase 2,"Female; Mice; Animals; Aryldialkylphosphatase; Alzheimer Disease; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Mice, Transgenic; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases","Beggiato, S; Ferrara, F; Romani, A; Cassano, T; Trentini, A; Valacchi, G; Cervellati, C; Ferraro, L"

A novel near-infrared fluorescent probe for high-sensitivity detection of butyrylcholinesterase in various pathological states.,"Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a crucial hydrolytic enzyme predominantly synthesized in the liver, playing a significant role in conditions like liver disorders, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and fat metabolism regulation. This study aims to address the current limitations in visualizing BChE activity in diseases at various states by introducing an ultra-sensitive near-infrared fluorescent probe, FDCM-BChE. The probe was engineered to have several properties, such as a large Stokes shift, rapid response time, high stability, excellent selectivity, and low detection limits. We validated the efficacy of FDCM-BChE in quantifying BChE activity in human serum and leveraged its low cytotoxicity for cellular imaging. The study revealed the downregulation of BChE activity in liver cancer and hepatic injury and the upregulation in diabetes. Thus, FDCM-BChE shows promise as a tool for specific applications, providing insights into diseases associated with BChE activity.",2024,Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE); Diabetes; Fluorescent probe; Liver diseases; Near-infrared,Humans; Butyrylcholinesterase; Fluorescent Dyes; Alzheimer Disease; Liver; Diabetes Mellitus,"Jiang, Y; Cui, H; Yu, Q"
Dysuricemia.,"Gout results from elevated serum urate (SU) levels, or hyperuricemia, and is a globally widespread and increasingly burdensome disease. Recent studies have illuminated the pathophysiology of gout/hyperuricemia and its epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and complications. The genetic involvement of urate transporters and enzymes is also proven. URAT1, a molecular therapeutic target for gout/hyperuricemia, was initially derived from research into hereditary renal hypouricemia (RHUC). RHUC is often accompanied by complications such as exercise-induced acute kidney injury, which indicates the key physiological role of uric acid. Several studies have also revealed its physiological role as both an anti-oxidant and a pro-oxidant, acting as both a scavenger and a generator of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). These discoveries have prompted research interest in SU and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), an enzyme that produces both urate and ROSs, as status or progression biomarkers of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The notion of ""the lower, the better"" is therefore incorrect; a better understanding of uric acid handling and metabolism/transport comes from an awareness that excessively high and low levels both cause problems. We summarize here the current body of evidence, demonstrate that uric acid is much more than a metabolic waste product, and finally propose the novel disease concept of ""dysuricemia"" on the path toward ""normouricemia"", or optimal SU level, to take advantage of the dual roles of uric acid. Our proposal should help to interpret the spectrum from hypouricemia to hyperuricemia/gout as a single disease category.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Parkinson’s disease (PD); anti-oxidative effects; bucket-and-balls theory; cardiovascular disease (CVD); chronic kidney disease (CKD); crystal formation; monosodium urate (MSU); neurodegenerative diseases (NDs); pro-oxidative effects,,"Nakayama, A; Kurajoh, M; Toyoda, Y; Takada, T; Ichida, K; Matsuo, H"
Navigating the Complexities of Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES): Current State and Future Challenges.,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a unique neurodegenerative disease that is associated with repetitive head impacts (RHI) in both civilian and military settings. In 2014, the research criteria for the clinical manifestation of CTE, traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES), were proposed to improve the clinical identification and understanding of the complex neuropathological phenomena underlying CTE. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the neuropathological and clinical features of CTE, proposed biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both research and clinical settings, and a range of treatments based on previous preclinical and clinical research studies. Due to the heterogeneity of TBI, there is no universally agreed-upon serum, CSF, or neuroimaging marker for its diagnosis. However, as our understanding of this complex disease continues to evolve, it is likely that there will be more robust, early diagnostic methods and effective clinical treatments. This is especially important given the increasing evidence of a correlation between TBI and neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and CTE. As public awareness of these conditions grows, it is imperative to prioritize both basic and clinical research, as well as the implementation of necessary safe and preventative measures.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); repetitive head impacts (RHI); traumatic brain injury (TBI); traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES),,"Fesharaki-Zadeh, A"

Elevated Homocysteine Level and Brain Atrophy Changes as Markers to Screen the Alzheimer Disease: Case Series.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Its clinical manifestations include a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive domains, as well as brain atrophy. An elevated homocysteine level (&gt;15 µmol/L), known as hyperhomocysteinemia, is also an attributing risk factor for AD, vascular pathologies, and brain atrophy. Neuroimaging studies including T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed white matter hyperintensities in the periventricular and deep white matter, enlarged ventricles, widened sulci, and decreased white matter mass, which are features of aging, as well as cerebrovascular changes. This case series investigated changes in biochemical marker levels including serum homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12, and the degree of atrophic variations in cortical-subcortical white matter in AD. The present study hypothesized that serum homocysteine levels might be used as a surrogate marker to screen for AD at an earlier stage.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Brain atrophy; Homocysteine; Vitamin B12,,"Sah, RP; Vidya, CS; Pereira, P; Jayaram, S; Yadav, AK; Sujatha, P"

Serum Bile Acids Improve Prediction of Alzheimer's Progression in a Sex-Dependent Manner.,"Sex disparities in serum bile acid (BA) levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence have been established. However, the precise link between changes in serum BAs and AD development remains elusive. Here, authors quantitatively determined 33 serum BAs and 58 BA features in 4 219 samples collected from 1 180 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The findings revealed that these BA features exhibited significant correlations with clinical stages, encompassing cognitively normal (CN), early and late mild cognitive impairment, and AD, as well as cognitive performance. Importantly, these associations are more pronounced in men than women. Among participants with progressive disease stages (n = 660), BAs underwent early changes in men, occurring before AD. By incorporating BA features into diagnostic and predictive models, positive enhancements are achieved for all models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve improved from 0.78 to 0.91 for men and from 0.76 to 0.83 for women for the differentiation of CN and AD. Additionally, the key findings are validated in a subset of participants (n = 578) with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and tau levels. These findings underscore the role of BAs in AD progression, offering potential improvements in the accuracy of AD prediction.",2024,alzheimer's disease; bile acid; cholesterol; mild cognitive impairment; sex difference,Male; Humans; Female; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Bile Acids and Salts,"Chen, T; Wang, L; Xie, G; Kristal, BS; Zheng, X; Sun, T; Arnold, M; Louie, G; Li, M; Wu, L; Mahmoudiandehkordi, S; Sniatynski, MJ; Borkowski, K; Guo, Q; Kuang, J; Wang, J; Nho, K; Ren, Z; Kueider-Paisley, A; Blach, C; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Jia, W"

A Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet mitigates modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer's Disease: a serum and CSF-based metabolic analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a variety of modifiable risk factors, including a person's dietary habits. While the ketogenic diet (KD) holds promise in reducing metabolic risks and potentially affecting AD progression, only a few studies have explored KD's metabolic impact, especially on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our study involved participants at risk for AD, either cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment. The participants consumed both a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and the American Heart Association diet (AHAD) for 6 weeks each, separated by a 6-week washout period. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics to profile serum and CSF and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples. While the AHAD induced no notable metabolic changes, MMKD led to significant alterations in both serum and CSF. These changes included improved modifiable risk factors, like increased HDL-C and reduced BMI, reversed serum metabolic disturbances linked to AD such as a microbiome-mediated increase in valine levels, and a reduction in systemic inflammation. Additionally, the MMKD was linked to increased amino acid levels in the CSF, a breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and decreased valine levels. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between metabolic changes in the CSF and serum, suggesting a systemic regulation of metabolism. Our findings highlight that MMKD can improve AD-related risk factors, reverse some metabolic disturbances associated with AD, and align metabolic changes across the blood-CSF barrier.",2023,,,"Schweickart, A; Batra, R; Neth, BJ; Martino, C; Shenhav, L; Zhang, AR; Shi, P; Karu, N; Huynh, K; Meikle, PJ; Schimmel, L; Dilmore, AH; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Blach, C; Dorrestein, PC; Knight, R; Craft, S; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Krumsiek, J"

An overview of mild traumatic brain injuries and emerging therapeutic targets.,"The majority of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), approximately 90%, are classified as mild (mTBIs). Globally, an estimated 4 million injuries occur each year from concussions or mTBIs, highlighting their significance as a public health crisis. TBIs can lead to substantial long-term health consequences, including an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease (PD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and nearly doubling one's risk of suicide. However, the current management of mTBIs in clinical practice and the available treatment options are limited. There exists an unmet need for effective therapy. This review addresses various aspects of mTBIs based on the most up-to-date literature review, with the goal of stimulating translational research to identify new therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. First, we provide a summary of mTBI symptomatology and current diagnostic parameters such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) for classifying mTBIs or concussions, as well as the utility of alternative diagnostic parameters, including imaging techniques like MRI with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and serum biomarkers such as S100B, NSE, GFAP, UCH-L1, NFL, and t-tau. Our review highlights several pre-clinical concussion models employed in the study of mTBIs and the underlying cellular mechanisms involved in mTBI-related pathogenesis, including axonal damage, demyelination, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Finally, we examine a selection of new therapeutic targets currently under investigation in pre-clinical models. These targets may hold promise for clinical translation and address the pressing need for more effective treatments for mTBIs.",2024,Axonal damage; Demyelination; Inflammation; Oxidative stress; mTBI,"Humans; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Brain Concussion; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Brain Injuries; Treatment Outcome","Bielanin, JP; Metwally, SAH; Paruchuri, SS; Sun, D"

A body of evidence suggest that oxidative stress and autophagy are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Andrographis paniculata (AP) is a native plant with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, and regulation of autophagy properties. AP significantly alleviated cognitive impairments, reduced Aβ deposition and has neuroprotective effect. However, its effects on aluminum-induced AD model have not been studied much.

Interfacial Electromigration for Analysis of Biofluid Lipids in Small Volumes.,"Lipids are important biomarkers within the field of disease diagnostics and can serve as indicators of disease progression and predictors of treatment effectiveness. Although lipids can provide important insight into how diseases initiate and progress, mass spectrometric methods for lipid characterization and profiling are limited due to lipid structural diversity, particularly the presence of various lipid isomers. Moreover, the difficulty of handling small-volume samples exacerbates the intricacies of biological analyses. In this work, we have developed a strategy that electromigrates a thin film of a small-volume biological sample directly to the air-liquid interface formed at the tip of a theta capillary. Importantly, we seamlessly integrated in situ biological lipid extraction with accelerated chemical derivatization, enabled by the air-liquid interface, and conducted isomeric structural characterization within a unified platform utilizing theta capillary nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry, all tailored for small-volume sample analysis. We applied this unified platform to the analysis of lipids from small-volume human plasma and Alzheimer's disease mouse serum samples. Accelerated electro-epoxidation of unsaturated lipids at the interface allowed us to characterize lipid double-bond positional isomers. The unique application of electromigration of a thin film to the air-liquid interface in combination with accelerated interfacial reactions holds great potential in small-volume sample analysis for disease diagnosis and prevention.",2023,,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Mass Spectrometry; Isomerism; Lipids; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization","Edwards, ME; Freitas, DP; Hirtzel, EA; White, N; Wang, H; Davidson, LA; Chapkin, RS; Sun, Y; Yan, X"

Here, the effects of 2 months of treatment with α-D-1,6-glucan (CPA) and selenium-containing α-D-1,6-glucan (Se-CPA) on early cognitive dysfunction and neuropathology were explored in the 3-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mouse. The results of the Morris water maze and open-field test revealed that Se-CPA exerted more significant effects than CPA in improving cognitive function and depressive-like behavior by attenuating the oxidative stress, decreasing serum LPS level, downregulating the inflammation of astrocytes and microglia through inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, mitigating neuronal cells loss and improving synaptic plasticity. Moreover, Se-CPA exerted beneficial effects on reshaping gut microbiome by increasing the microbial α-diversity, enhancing the proportion of beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila and promoting the SCFAs concentration. These findings provide evidence that Se-CPA might be a potentially viable compound for AD prevention.",2024,"Alzheimer's disease; Antiinflammatory activity; Glucan; Intestinal microbiota; Selenium-containing α-D-1,6-glucan","Mice; Animals; Selenium; Alzheimer Disease; Mice, Transgenic; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Che, H; Wang, X; He, S; Dong, X; Lv, L; Xie, W; Li, H"
"Aggregation and cytotoxicity of food additive dye (Azorubine)-albumin adducts: a multi-spectroscopic, microscopic and computational analysis.","Protein and peptide misfolding is a central factor in the formation of pathological aggregates and fibrils linked to disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, it's essential to understand how food additives, particularly Azorubine, affect protein structures and their ability to induce aggregation. In this study, human serum albumin (HSA) was used as a model protein to investigate the binding and conformational changes caused by azorubine, a common food and drink colorant. The research revealed that azorubine destabilized the conformation of HSA at both physiological (pH 7.4) and acidic (pH 3.5) conditions. The loss of tryptophan fluorescence in HSA suggested significant structural alterations, particularly around aromatic residues. Far UV-CD analysis demonstrated disruptions in HSA's secondary structure, with a notable reduction in α-helical structures at pH 7.4. At pH 3.5, Azorubine induced even more extensive perturbations, resulting in a random coil conformation at higher azorubine concentrations. The study also investigated aggregation phenomena through turbidity measurements, RLS analysis, and TEM imaging. At pH 3.5, larger insoluble aggregates formed, while at pH 7.4, only conformational changes occurred without aggregate formation. Cytotoxicity assessments on neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells highlighted the concentration-dependent toxicity of albumin aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reaffirmed the stable interaction between azorubine and HSA. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms by which azorubine influences protein conformations. To further advance our understanding and contribute to the broader knowledge in this area, several future directions can be considered such as exploring other proteins, studying dose-response relationship, gaining mechanistic insights, biological relevance, toxicity assessment, identifying alternative food colorants, and mitigation strategies to prevent adverse effects of azorubine on serum proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TRIM22 facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by mediating the association of GABARAPs and PLEKHM1.,"Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are a large family of E3 ubiquitin ligases implicated in antiviral defense systems, tumorigenesis, and protein quality control. TRIM proteins contribute to protein quality control by regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, and macroautophagy/autophagy. However, the detailed mechanisms through which various TRIM proteins regulate downstream events have not yet been fully elucidated. Herein, we identified a novel function of TRIM22 in the regulation of autophagy. TRIM22 promotes autophagosome-lysosome fusion by mediating the association of GABARAP family proteins with PLEKHM1, thereby inducing the autophagic clearance of protein aggregates, independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, a TRIM22 variant associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer disease interferes with autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagic clearance. These findings suggest TRIM22 as a critical autophagic regulator that orchestrates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by scaffolding autophagy-related proteins, thus representing a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,Alzheimer disease; PLEKHM1; TRIM22; autophagosome-lysosome fusion; autophagy,"Autophagosomes; Humans; Lysosomes; Autophagy; Tripartite Motif Proteins; Membrane Fusion; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; HEK293 Cells; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Protein Binding; Animals; Autophagy-Related Proteins; Repressor Proteins; Minor Histocompatibility Antigens","Heo, H; Park, H; Lee, MS; Kim, J; Kim, J; Jung, SY; Kim, SK; Lee, S; Chang, J"
Psychological and neurobiological mechanisms involved in the relationship between loneliness and cognitive decline in older adults.,"Loneliness, among older adults, is one of the risk factors for developing dementia. Still, little is known about the neurobiological and psychological conditions that link loneliness to cognitive decline. The current study investigated several research aims: First, it sought to identify neurobiological and psychological pathways that may account for the relationship between loneliness and decline across several cognitive domains. These pathways included depressive symptoms, total gray matter volume, and conditional analyses of pro-inflammatory cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Second, it examined loneliness as a predictor of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Third, it sought to determine whether the relationship between loneliness and cognitive decline is sex-specific in older adults. Longitudinal data were collected from 2130 Rush Memory and Aging Project participants. Participants underwent annual cognitive and psychological assessments and neuroimaging procedures every year. BDNF gene expression was measured in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cytokines were measured in serum, and the final consensus clinical diagnosis was identified at the time of death. All linear mixed and multinomial logistic regression models controlled for age at baseline, education, sex, and APOE genotype. Participants were largely women (73 %), and Caucasian (93 %). The average education was 14.93 (SD = 3.34). The average age at baseline was 80.05 (SD = 7.57). Results showed that gray matter volume and depressive symptoms partially mediated the relationship between loneliness and cognitive decline. There was a significant interaction between loneliness and BDNF expression in relation to cognitive decline. Higher levels of BDNF expression was associated with slower decline in semantic memory and visuospatial ability. Finally, the current study also established that higher levels of loneliness was positively associated with the incidence of AD and other dementias. The present findings support the growing literature, which tends to show that the consequence of loneliness goes beyond the feeling of being isolated. Loneliness may induce physiological changes in our brains, leading to cognitive decline. Future research can explore a wide range of biological and psychological expressions of loneliness to clarify how loneliness relates to dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; BDNF; Cognitive decline; Depressive symptoms; Gray matter volume; IL-6; Loneliness,Male; Humans; Female; Aged; Loneliness; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Cytokines,"Dabiri, S; Mwendwa, DT; Campbell, A"

"Potential Implications of miRNAs in the Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Therapeutics of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial disorder that poses a substantial burden on patients, caregivers, and society. Considering the increased aging population and life expectancy, the incidence of AD will continue to rise in the following decades. However, the molecular pathogenesis of AD remains controversial, superior blood-based biomarker candidates for early diagnosis are still lacking, and effective therapeutics to halt or slow disease progression are urgently needed. As powerful genetic regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) are receiving increasing attention due to their implications in the initiation, development, and theranostics of various diseases, including AD. In this review, we summarize miRNAs that directly target microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) transcripts and regulate the alternative splicing of tau and APP. We also discuss related kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), as well as apolipoprotein E, that are directly targeted by miRNAs to control tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenic APP processing leading to Aβ pathologies. Moreover, there is evidence of miRNA-mediated modulation of inflammation. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs in the serum or plasma of AD patients as noninvasive biomarkers with diagnostic potential are reviewed. In addition, miRNA-based therapeutics optimized with nanocarriers or exosomes as potential options for AD treatment are discussed.",2023,APOE; Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid precursor protein; beta-amyloid; diagnosis; microRNA; neuroinflammation; tau; therapy,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; MicroRNAs; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; tau Proteins; Phosphorylation; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Wang, L; Shui, X; Diao, Y; Chen, D; Zhou, Y; Lee, TH"

Serum biomarkers associated with aging and neurodegeneration in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).,"The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small South American monkey, is an important nonhuman primate model in the study of aging and age-related neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and related dementias. Thorough characterization of the wild type marmoset brain agingmodel, including biomarkers of aging and neural degeneration, will further the marmoset's utility in translational research. We measured serum concentration of four key biomarkers of neural degeneration [total tau (T-tau), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1)] via single molecule array from 24 marmosets (female n = 13, male n = 11) ranging in age from 1.3 to 18.7 years. Aged marmosets (>7 years) had significantly higher GFAP, NfL, UCH-L1, and T-tau than adult marmosets. Sex differences were not detected for any of these biomarker concentrations. These data provide an important initial range of reference values for GFAP, NfL, T-tau, and UCH-L1 to evaluate aging and neural health in marmosets, as well as evaluation of therapeutics in clinical models of disease.",2024,Biomarkers; Common marmoset; GFAP; Neurodegeneration; Neurofilament light; Tau; UCH-L1,Animals; Male; Female; Callithrix; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Biomarkers; Brain; Aging; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase,"Phillips, KA; Lopez, M; Bartling-John, E; Meredith, R; Buteau, A; Alvarez, A; Ross, CN"

Vascularized Brain Assembloids With Enhanced Cellular Complexity Provide Insights Into the Cellular Deficits of Tauopathy.,"Advanced technologies have enabled the engineering of self-organized 3-dimensional (3D) cellular structures from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), namely organoids, which recapitulate some key features of tissue development and functions of the human central nervous system (CNS). While hiPSC-derived 3D CNS organoids hold promise in providing a human-specific platform for studying CNS development and diseases, most of them do not incorporate the full range of implicated cell types, including vascular cell components and microglia, limiting their ability to accurately recreate the CNS environment and their utility in the study of certain aspects of the disease. Here we have developed a novel approach, called vascularized brain assembloids, for constructing hiPSC-derived 3D CNS structures with a higher level of cellular complexity. This is achieved by integrating forebrain organoids with common myeloid progenitors and phenotypically stabilized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (VeraVecs), which can be cultured and expanded in serum-free conditions. Compared with organoids, these assembloids exhibited enhanced neuroepithelial proliferation, advanced astrocytic maturation, and increased synapse numbers. Strikingly, the assembloids derived from hiPSCs harboring the tauP301S mutation exhibited increased levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau, along with a higher proportion of rod-like microglia-like cells and enhanced astrocytic activation, when compared to the assembloids derived from isogenic hiPSCs. Additionally, the tauP301S assembloids showed an altered profile of neuroinflammatory cytokines. This innovative assembloid technology serves as a compelling proof-of-concept model, opening new avenues for unraveling the intricate complexities of the human brain and accelerating progress in the development of effective treatments for neurological disorders.",2024,brain assembloid; brain organoid; human induced pluripotent stem cells; tauopathy,Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Brain; Central Nervous System; Organoids; Tauopathies; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells,"Sun, X; Kofman, S; Ogbolu, VC; Karch, CM; Ibric, L; Qiang, L"
Nano-Brush Structure for Rapid Label-Free Differentiation of Alzheimer's Disease Stages and Direct Capture of Neuron-Derived Exosomes from Human Blood Plasma.,"The measurement of the neurofilament light chain (NFL) in human blood plasma/serum is a promising liquid biopsy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, offering advantages over conventional neuroimaging techniques recommended in clinical guidelines. Here, a controllable nano-brush structure comprising upstanding silicon nanowires coated with indium tin oxide was employed as the sensing substrate. This nano-brush structure was modified with an NFL antibody (NFLAb) via silane coupling and then further connected as the extended gate in a field-effect transistor (EGFET). Notable signal differences emerged within a 2 min timeframe, enabling the label-free differentiation in human blood plasmas among four distinct cohorts: healthy controls, subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia due to AD. Our study indicates that achieving a surface roughness exceeding 400 nm on the modified nano-brush structure enables the effective electrical sensing in our EGFETs. These distinct electrical responses measured via the NFLAb-modified nano-brush EGFETs can be attributed to the combined effects of the captured NFLs and NFL-specific neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) found in dementia patients, as confirmed by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Finally, the potential of quantitatively detecting NDEs on the NFLAb-modified nano-brush structure was demonstrated using spiked solutions containing NFL-specific NDEs from IMR-32 neuroblast cells, wherein concentration-dependent changes were observed in the EGFETs output signal. Our findings show that the NFLAb-modified nano-brush EGFET enables rapid, label-free differentiation between healthy individuals and patients at varying stages of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease stage; nano-brush structure; neurofilament light chain; neuron-derived exosome; sensing substrate; upstanding nanowires,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Exosomes; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neurons; Plasma; Biomarkers,"Lin, SP; Lee, WJ; Sun, MC; Yang, YH; Vinzons, LU; Lin, YM; Wei, YT"
Electroacupuncture modulates glutamate neurotransmission to alleviate PTSD-like behaviors in a PTSD animal model.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that develops after exposure to a traumatic event. Owing to the relatively low rates of response and remission with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as the primary treatment for PTSD, there is a recognized need for alternative strategies to effectively address the symptoms of PTSD. Dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission plays a critical role in various disorders, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the regulation of glutamate levels holds great promise as a therapeutic target for the treatment of mental disorders. Electroacupuncture (EA) has become increasingly popular as a complementary and alternative medicine approach. It maintains the homeostasis of central nervous system (CNS) function and alleviates symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia. This study investigated the effects of EA at the GV29 (Yintang) acupoint three times per week for 2 weeks in an animal model of PTSD. PTSD was induced using single prolonged stress/shock (SPSS) in mice, that is, SPS with additional foot shock stimulation. EA treatment significantly reduced PTSD-like behavior and effectively regulated serum corticosterone and serotonin levels in the PTSD model. Additionally, EA treatment decreased glutamate levels and glutamate neurotransmission-related proteins (pNR1 and NR2B) in the hippocampus of a PTSD model. In addition, neuronal activity and the number of Golgi-impregnated dendritic spines were significantly lower in the EA treatment group than in the SPSS group. Notably, EA treatment effectively reduced glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (caspase-3, Bax, and pJNK). These findings suggest that EA treatment at the GV29 acupoint holds promise as a potential therapeutic approach for PTSD, possibly through the regulation of NR2B receptor-mediated glutamate neurotransmission to reduce PTSD-like behaviors.",2023,,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Glutamic Acid; Electroacupuncture; Hippocampus; Disease Models, Animal; Synaptic Transmission","Cai, M; Park, HR; Yang, EJ"
Multi-omics data reveals aberrant gut microbiota-host glycerophospholipid metabolism in association with neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice.,"Numerous studies have described the notable impact of gut microbiota on the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) via the gut - brain axis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of gut microbiota in the development of AD are limited. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms of gut microbiota in AD by integrating multi-omics data. In this study, APP/PS1 and WT mice at nine months of age were used as study mouse model. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test. The levels of Aβ plaque and neuroinflammation in the brain were detected using immunofluorescence and PET/CT. In addition, we not only used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics to explore the variation characteristics of gut microbiota and serum metabolism abundance, but also combined spatial metabolomics and transcriptomics to explore the change in the brain and identify their potential correlation. APP/PS1 mice showed significant cognitive impairment and amyloid-β deposits in the brain.

Evaluation of possible neuroprotective effects of virgin coconut oil on aluminum-induced neurotoxicity in an in vitro Alzheimer's disease model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects various cognitive functions, behavior, and personality. AD is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including exposure to aluminum (Al). Virgin coconut oil (VCO) may have potential as a natural neuroprotectant against AD. Aim of this study was to determine neuroprotective effects of VCO on Al-induced neurotoxicity in an in vitro AD model. SH-SY5Y cells were initially cultured in normal growth medium and then differentiated by reducing fetal bovine serum content and adding retinoic acid (RA). Later, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was added along with RA. The differentiation process was completed on the seventh day. Study groups (n = 3) were designed as control group, VCO group, Al group, Al-VCO group, Alzheimer model (AD) group, AD + Al-exposed group (AD+Al), AD + VCO applied group (AD + VCO) and AD + Al-exposed + VCO applied group (AD + Al + VCO). Specific markers of AD (hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, amyloid beta 1-40 peptide, and amyloid precursor protein) were measured in all groups. In addition, oxidative stress parameters (total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidase, protein carbonyl, and reactive oxygen species) and neurotransmitter-related parameters (dopamine, dopamine transporter acetylcholine, and synuclein alpha levels, acetylcholinesterase activity) were measured comparatively in the study groups. VCO reduced amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein levels in the study groups. In addition, oxidative stress levels decreased, and neurotransmitter parameters improved with VCO. Our study shows that VCO may have potential therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease and further experiments are needed to determine its efficacy.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; aluminum; coconut oil; neurotransmitter,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Coconut Oil; Neuroprotective Agents; Aluminum; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Acetylcholinesterase; Neuroblastoma; Neurotransmitter Agents,"Demirel, G; Sanajou, S; Yirün, A; Çakir, DA; Berkkan, A; Baydar, T; Erkekoğlu, P"

Specific serum autoantibodies predict the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease with high accuracy.,"Autoimmunity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether autoantibodies in peripheral blood can be used as biomarkers for AD has been elusive. Serum samples were obtained from 1,686 participants, including 767 with AD, 146 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 255 with other neurodegenerative diseases, and 518 healthy controls. Specific autoantibodies were measured using a custom-made immunoassay. Multivariate support vector machine models were employed to investigate the correlation between serum autoantibody levels and disease states. As a result, seven candidate AD-specific autoantibodies were identified, including MAPT, DNAJC8, KDM4D, SERF1A, CDKN1A, AGER, and ASXL1. A classification model with high accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.94) was established. Importantly, these autoantibodies could distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative diseases and out-performed amyloid and tau protein concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid in predicting cognitive decline (P < 0.001). This study indicated that AD onset and progression are possibly accompanied by an unappreciated serum autoantibody response. Therefore, future studies could optimize its application as a convenient biomarker for the early detection of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarker; Early detection; Predicting; Serum autoantibodies,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Autoantibodies; Disease Progression; Peptide Fragments; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases; Nerve Tissue Proteins,"Fang, L; Jiao, B; Liu, X; Wang, Z; Yuan, P; Zhou, H; Xiao, X; Cao, L; Guo, J; Tang, B; Shen, L"

Alterations in Immune Responses Are Associated with Dysfunctional Intracellular Signaling in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Men and Women with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,"Deficits in the neuroendocrine-immune network in the periphery associated with the onset and progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been extensively studied. The present study correlatively examines the association between cell-mediated immune responses, stress hormones, amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and intracellular signaling molecules in the pathophysiology of MCI and AD compared to adults. Serum APP, lymphocyte proliferation, total cholinesterase (TChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities, cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α), and intracellular signaling molecules (p-ERK, p-CREB, and p-Akt) were measured in the PBMCs of adult, old, MCI, and AD men and women initially and after 3 years in the same population. An age- and disease-associated decline in mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and lymphocyte proliferation of MCI and AD men and women were observed. An age- and disease-related increase in serum APP, cortisol levels, and TChE activity were observed in men and women. Enhanced production of Th1 cytokine, IL-2, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and suppressed intracellular transcription factors may promote the inflammatory environment in MCI and AD patients. The expression of CREB and Akt was lower in MCI and AD men, while the expression of p-ERK was higher, and p-CREB was lower in MCI and AD women after 3 years.

Interleukin 10 (IL10) promoter region polymorphism is associated with IL10 serum concentrations and processing speed in healthy community-dwelling older adults.,"Inflammation is repressed by interleukin 10 (IL10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, and unchecked inflammation can have detrimental effects on cognition. In healthy older adults enrolled in the Australian Research Council Longevity Intervention (ARCLI) cohort we explored whether a known functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of IL10, -1082 G/A (rs1800896), was associated with reaction times on computerized cognitive testing that included elements of processing speed (i.e., reaction time). Participants were aged 60-75 years (240 females, 158 males), free of dementia and psychiatric disorders, and provide a blood sample. Processing speed was measured using the Swinburne University Computerized Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB), which includes measures of reaction time (in milliseconds, ms) on six tasks. Blood-derived DNA was genotyped for the IL10 rs1800896 SNP and presence of the APOE E4 allele. General linear models for each SUCCAB subtest were fitted, with age, sex, education (years), APOE E4 carrier status, and IL10 genotype as independent variables.

Chiral nanoparticle-remodeled gut microbiota alleviates neurodegeneration via the gut-brain axis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β accumulation in the brain and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation, as well as neuroinflammation. The gut-brain axis has emerged as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases by modulating metabolic activity, neuroimmune functions and sensory neuronal signaling. Here we investigate interactions between orally ingested chiral Au nanoparticles and the gut microbiota in AD mice. Oral administration of chiral Au nanoparticles restored cognitive abilities and ameliorated amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau pathologies in AD mice via alterations in the gut microbiome composition and an increase in the gut metabolite, indole-3-acetic acid, which was lower in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD compared with age-matched controls. Oral administration of indole-3-acetic acid was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and alleviated cognitive decline and pathology including neuroinflammation in AD mice. These findings provide a promising therapeutic target for the amelioration of neuroinflammation and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",2023,,Humans; Mice; Animals; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Brain-Gut Axis; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Guo, X; Li, C; Zhang, J; Sun, M; Xu, J; Xu, C; Kuang, H; Xu, L"
A systematic review of the neuropathology and memory decline induced by monosodium glutamate in the Alzheimer's disease-like animal model.,"This systematic review analyzes monosodium glutamate (MSG) in the Alzheimer's disease-like condition to enhance translational research. Our review seeks to understand how MSG affects the brain and causes degenerative disorders. Due to significant preclinical data linking glutamate toxicity to Alzheimer's disease and the lack of a comprehensive review or meta-analysis, we initiated a study on MSG's potential link. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, DOAJ, and Scopus for animal research and English language papers without time constraints. This study used the PRISMA-P framework and PICO technique to collect population, intervention or exposure, comparison, and result data. It was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022371502. MSG affected mice's exploratory behaviors and short-term working memory. The brain, hippocampus, and cerebellar tissue demonstrated neuronal injury-related histological and histomorphometric changes. A total of 70% of MSG-treated mice had poor nesting behavior. The treated mice also had more hyperphosphorylated tau protein in their cortical and hippocampus neurons. Glutamate and glutamine levels in the brain increased with MSG, and dose-dependent mixed horizontal locomotor, grooming, and anxiety responses reduced. MSG treatment significantly decreased phospho-CREB protein levels, supporting the idea that neurons were harmed, despite the increased CREB mRNA expression. High MSG doses drastically lower brain tissue and serum serotonin levels. In conclusion, MSG showed AD-like pathology, neuronal atrophy, and short-term memory impairment. Further research with a longer time span and deeper behavioral characterization is needed.

Development of a P-tau217 Electrochemiluminescent Immunosensor Reinforced with Au-Cu Nanoparticles for Alzheimer's Disease Precaution.,"To simply and rapidly detect the highly phosphorylated tau protein at threonine 217 (p-tau217) as a precautionary measure against Alzheimer's disease and distinguish it from other neurodegenerative diseases, a novel immunosensor was prepared using luminol as the electrochemiluminescent (ECL) sensing probe reinforced by Au-Cu nanoparticles (Au-Cu NPs). The Au-Cu alloy NPs were prepared via a co-reduction reaction, exhibiting excellent conductivity and catalytic activity. These properties remarkably enhanced the ECL of luminol, providing a suitable background for the sensing response. After the Au-Cu NPs were decorated on the surface of indium tin oxide glass using 3-amino-propyl trimethoxysilane, the antibody of p-tau217 was immobilized via dominant Au-N bonding to enable the biological specificity of the immunosensor. When p-tau217 specifically interacted with an antibody to form an immune complex on the sensing interface, the ECL signal of the sensor was considerably inhibited by the resulting giant biomolecular complex. This complex prevented luminol diffusion to the electrode surface and electron transfer. The resulting immunosensor showed remarkable sensitivity to p-tau217, with a wide linear detection range from 5 to 600 pg/mL. A detection limit of 0.56 pg/mL was achieved, with recoveries in human serum ranging from 92.3 to 109%. This ECL immunosensor demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity toward p-tau217, along with good reproducibility and stability, providing a new approach for clinical research on Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Au−Cu nanoparticles; P-tau217; electrochemiluminescence; immunosensor,Humans; Luminol; Alzheimer Disease; Biosensing Techniques; Reproducibility of Results; Immunoassay; Nanoparticles; Antibodies; Luminescent Measurements; Metal Nanoparticles; Gold; Electrochemical Techniques,"Kong, S; Wen, X; Wang, Y; Tan, R; Li, H; Tu, Y"

Synthesis and biological evaluation of indane-based fluorescent probes for detection of amyloid-β aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.,"In this article, the development of fluorescent imaging probes for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated protein aggregates is described. Indane derivatives with a donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) structure were designed and synthesized. The probes were evaluated for their ability to bind to β-amyloid (Aβ) protein aggregates, which are a key pathological hallmark of AD. The results showed that several probes exhibited significant changes in fluorescence intensity at wavelengths greater than 600 nm when they were bound to Aβ aggregates compared to the Aβ monomeric form. Among the tested probes, four D-π-A type indane derivatives showed promising binding selectivity to Aβ aggregates over non-specific proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). The molecular docking study showed that our compounds were appropriately located along the Aβ fibril axis through the hydrophobic tunnel structure. Further analysis revealed that the most active compound having dimethylaminopyridyl group as an election donor and dicyano group as an electron acceptor could effectively stain Aβ plaques in brain tissue samples from AD transgenic mice. These findings suggest that our indane-based compounds have the potential to serve as fluorescent probes for the detection and monitoring of Aβ aggregation in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta; Donor-π-acceptor; Fluorescence; Indane,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Fluorescent Dyes; Protein Aggregates; Molecular Docking Simulation; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mice, Transgenic; Brain; Plaque, Amyloid","Lee, H; Kim, Y; Aziz, H; Kang, DM; Lee, J; Lee, S; Jung, S; Hyeon, S; Choo, H; Nam, G; Kim, YK; Lim, S; Min, SJ"
Human herpesvirus 6A and axonal injury before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis.,"Recent research indicates that multiple sclerosis is preceded by a prodromal phase with elevated levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), a marker of axonal injury. The effect of environmental risk factors on the extent of axonal injury during this prodrome is unknown. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study was to determine if HHV-6A serostatus is associated with the level of sNfL in the multiple sclerosis prodrome, which would support a causative role of HHV-6A. A nested case-control study was performed by crosslinking multiple sclerosis registries with Swedish biobanks. Individuals with biobank samples collected before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis were included as cases. Controls without multiple sclerosis were randomly selected, matched for biobank, sex, sampling date and age. Serostatus of HHV-6A and Epstein-Barr virus was analysed with a bead-based multiplex assay. The concentration of sNfL was analysed with single molecule array technology. The association between HHV-6A serology and sNfL was assessed by stratified t-tests and linear regressions, adjusted for Epstein-Barr virus serostatus and sampling age. Within-pair ratios of HHV-6A seroreactivity and sNfL were calculated for each case and its matched control. To assess the temporal relationship between HHV-6A antibodies and sNfL, these ratios were plotted against the time to the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis and compared using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regressions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Samples from 519 matched case-control pairs were included. In cases, seropositivity of HHV-6A was significantly associated with the level of sNfL (+11%, 95% CI 0.2-24%, P = 0.045) and most pronounced in the younger half of the cases (+24%, 95% CI 6-45%, P = 0.007). No such associations were observed among the controls. Increasing seroreactivity against HHV-6A was detectable before the rise of sNfL (significant within-pair ratios from 13.6 years versus 6.6 years before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis). In this study, we describe the association between HHV-6A antibodies and the degree of axonal injury in the multiple sclerosis prodrome. The findings indicate that elevated HHV-6A antibodies both precede and are associated with a higher degree of axonal injury, supporting the hypothesis that HHV-6A infection may contribute to multiple sclerosis development in a proportion of cases.",2024,Epstein-Barr virus; axonal injury; human herpesvirus 6-A; multiple sclerosis; neurofilament light chain,"Humans; Antibodies; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Herpesvirus 6, Human; Multiple Sclerosis; Male; Female","Grut, V; Biström, M; Salzer, J; Stridh, P; Jons, D; Gustafsson, R; Fogdell-Hahn, A; Huang, J; Butt, J; Lindam, A; Alonso-Magdalena, L; Bergström, T; Kockum, I; Waterboer, T; Olsson, T; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Andersen, O; Nilsson, S; Sundström, P"

High burdens of phosphorylated tau protein and distinct precuneus atrophy in sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is a rare devastating subclassification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). EOAD affects individuals <65 years old, and accounts for 5%-10% of all AD cases. Previous studies on EOAD primarily focused on familial forms, whereas research on sporadic EOAD (sEOAD), which represents 85%-90% of EOAD cases, is limited. In this prospective cohort study, participants were recruited between 2018 and 2023 and included patients with sEOAD (n = 110), late-onset AD (LOAD, n = 89), young controls (YC, n = 50), and older controls (OC, n = 25). All AD patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria based on biomarker evidence. Familial EOAD patients or non-AD dementia patients were excluded. Single molecule array technology was used to measure fluid biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, phosphorylated tau (P-tau) 181, total tau (T-tau), serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Patients with sEOAD exhibited more severe executive function impairment and bilateral precuneus atrophy (P < 0.05, family-wise error corrected) than patients with LOAD. Patients with sEOAD showed elevated CSF and plasma P-tau181 levels (154.0 ± 81.2 pg/mL, P = 0.002; and 6.1 ± 2.3 pg/mL, P = 0.046). Moreover, precuneus atrophy was significantly correlated with serum GFAP levels in sEOAD (P < 0.001). Serum GFAP levels (area under the curve (AUC) = 96.0%, cutoff value = 154.3 pg/mL) displayed excellent diagnostic value in distinguishing sEOAD patients from the control group.

Identification and diagnostic potential of serum microRNAs as biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"This study aimed to investigate the differential expression of serum microRNAs in cognitive normal subjects (NC), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the objective of identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers. A total of 320 clinical samples, including 32 MCI patients, 288 AD patients, and 288 healthy controls, were collected following international standards. The expression of microRNAs in serum was analyzed using the Agilent human microRNA oligonucleotide microarray, and bioinformatics methods were employed to predict target genes and their involvement in AD-related pathways. Among the 122 microRNAs screened, five microRNAs (hsa-miR-208a-5p, hsa-miR-125b-1-3p, hsa-miR-3194-3p, hsa-miR-4652-5p, and hsa-miR-4419a) exhibited differential expression and met quality control standards. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the target genes of these microRNAs were involved in multiple AD-related pathways, which changed with disease progression. These findings demonstrate significant differences in serum microRNA expression between NC, MCI, and AD patients. Three microRNAs were identified as potential candidates for the development of diagnostic models for MCI and AD. The results highlight the crucial role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD and provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and personalized treatment approaches for AD. This study contributes to the understanding of AD at the molecular level and offers potential avenues for early diagnosis and intervention in AD patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; diagnostic models; microRNA; serum,Humans; MicroRNAs; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Early Diagnosis,"Han, YH; Xiang, HY; Lee, DH; Feng, L; Sun, HN; Jin, MH; Kwon, T"

Relationship of Klotho with cognition and dementia: Results from the NHANES 2011-2014 and Mendelian randomization study.,"The relationships of Klotho levels with cognition and dementia are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between Klotho levels and cognitive function and to determine causality between Klotho and dementia using Mendelian randomization (MR). Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014, this study consisted of 1875 older adults aged 60-79 years. Cognitive function was assessed by the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). We performed weighted multivariable-adjusted linear regression to assess the association between Klotho concentrations and cognitive function. Then, 2-sample MR was conducted to assess the causal relationship between Klotho and dementia. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis. We observed a positive association between serum Klotho concentrations and the results of the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST) (T2: β 2.16, 95% CI: 0.30-4.01, P = 0.03, T3: β 2.48, 95% CI: 0.38-4.57, P = 0.02) after adjusting for the covariates. Moreover, there was also a potential nonlinear relationship between Klotho and DSST. The IVW method showed that genetically predicted high Klotho levels were not significantly associate with any type of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.96-1.10, P = 0.46), vascular dementia (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.87-1.25, P = 0.66), frontotemporal dementia (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.47-1.14, P = 0.16), or dementia with Lewy bodies (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.87-1.23, P = 0.73). In the cross-sectional observational study, Klotho and cognitive function were significantly correlated; however, findings from MR studies did not indicate a causal relationship between Klotho and dementia.",2023,,Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Nutrition Surveys,"Wu, Y; Lei, S; Li, D; Li, Z; Zhang, Y; Guo, Y"
"Piperazine-2-carboxylic acid derivatives as MTDLs anti-Alzheimer agents: Anticholinesterase activity, mechanistic aspect, and molecular modeling studies.","Development of Multitarget-Directed Ligands (MTDLs) is a promising approach to combat the complex etiologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a new series of 1,4-bisbenzylpiperazine-2-carboxylic acid derivatives 3-5(a-g), 7a-f, 8a-s, and their piperazine-2-yl-1,3,4-oxadiazole analogs 6a-g. In vitro inhibitory effect against Electrophorus electricus acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) from Equine serum was evaluated using modified Ellman's method, considering donepezil and tacrine as reference drugs. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis of the results proved competitive inhibition of AChE and BChE with Ki values, in low micromolar range. The free carboxylic acid series 4a-g showed enhanced selectivity for AChE. Hence, 4c, 1,4-bis (4-chlorobenzyl)-piperazinyl-2-carboxylic acid), was the most active member of this series (Ki (AChE) = 10.18 ± 1.00 µM) with clear selectivity for AChE (SI ∼ 17.90). However, the hydroxamic acids 7a-f and carboxamides 8a-s congeners were more potent and selective inhibitors of BChE (SI ∼ 5.38 - 21862.5). Extraordinarily, 1,4-bis (2-chlorobenzyl)-piperazinyl-2-hydroxamic acid 7b showed promising inhibitory activity against BChE enzyme (Ki = 1.6 ± 0.08 nM, SI = 21862.5), that was significantly superior to that elicited by donepezil (Ki = 12.5 ± 2.6 µM) and tacrine (Ki = 17.3 ± 2.3 nM). Cytotoxicity assessment of 4c and 7b, on human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines, revealed lower toxicity than staurosporine and was nearly comparable to that of donepezil. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation afforded unblemished insights into the structure-activity relationships for AChE and BChE inhibition. The results showed stable binding with fair H-bonding, hydrophobic and/or ionic interactions to the catalytic and peripheral anionic sites of the enzymes. In silico predicted ADME and physicochemical properties of conjugates showed good CNS bioavailability and safety parameters. In this regard, compound (7b) might be considered as a promising inhibitor of BChE with an innovative donepezil-based anti-Alzheimer activity. Further assessments of the most potent AChE and BChE inhibitors as potential MTDLs anti-Alzheimer's agents are under investigation with our research group and will be published later.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cholinesterase inhibitors; Cytotoxicity; Molecular modeling; Piperazinylcarboxylic acids,Animals; Horses; Humans; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Butyrylcholinesterase; Donepezil; Acetylcholinesterase; Tacrine; Molecular Docking Simulation; Neuroblastoma; Piperazines; Carboxylic Acids; Structure-Activity Relationship; Alzheimer Disease; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Molecular Structure,"Soliman, AM; Abd El-Wahab, HAA; Akincioglu, H; Gülçin, İ; Omar, FA"
Identifying Sex-Specific Serum Patterns of Alzheimer's Mice through Deep TMT Profiling and a Concentration-Dependent Concatenation Strategy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, disproportionately affecting women in disease prevalence and progression. Comprehensive analysis of the serum proteome in a common AD mouse model offers potential in identifying possible AD pathology- and gender-associated biomarkers. Here, we introduce a multiplexed, nondepleted mouse serum proteome profiling via tandem mass-tag (TMTpro) labeling. The labeled sample was separated into 475 fractions using basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), which were categorized into low-, medium-, and high-concentration fractions for concatenation. This concentration-dependent concatenation strategy resulted in 128 fractions for acidic RPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, collecting ∼5 million MS/MS scans and identifying 3972 unique proteins (3413 genes) that cover a dynamic range spanning at least 6 orders of magnitude. The differential expression analysis between wild type and the commonly used AD model (5xFAD) mice exhibited minimal significant protein alterations. However, we detected 60 statistically significant (FDR < 0.05), sex-specific proteins, including complement components, serpins, carboxylesterases, major urinary proteins, cysteine-rich secretory protein 1, pregnancy-associated murine protein 1, prolactin, amyloid P component, epidermal growth factor receptor, fibrinogen-like protein 1, and hepcidin.

Repurposing and clinical attributes of antidiabetic drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.,"The risk of neurodegeneration was found to be increased among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others are considered neurodegenerative diseases and can be characterized by progressive loss of neurons. The deficiency of insulin, impaired signaling, and its resistance lead to alteration in the neuronal functioning of the brain. Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a significant role in the amyloid β metabolism, aggregation, and deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain's hippocampal and cortical neuronal regions. The insulin signaling via IP3 activation upregulates the IDE and could be a promising approach to regulate neurodegeneration. The repurposing of existing antidiabetic drugs such as Metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1), sodium-glucose co-transport-2 (SGCT-2) inhibitors, and insulin could be an alternative and effective strategy to treat neurodegeneration via modulating insulin signaling, insulin resistance, IDE activity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, serum lipid profile and neuroinflammation in the brain. Antidiabetic medications reduce the risk of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and Aβ deposition by enhancing their clearance rate. The downregulation of IDE alters the degradation of Aβ monomers in the Tg2576 APP mice. Also, the treatment with metformin activated the AMPK pathway and suppressed mTOR and BACE-1 protein expression in the APP/PS1-induced mice model. Thus, the primary intention of this review is to explore the link between T2DM and neurodegenerative disorders, and the possible role of various antidiabetic drugs in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,AMPK/mTOR/BACE1; Antidiabetic drugs; Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE); Insulin resistance; Neurodegenerative disorders; Oxidative stress,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Hypoglycemic Agents; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Repositioning; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Insulin; Metformin","Birajdar, SV; Mazahir, F; Alam, MI; Kumar, A; Yadav, AK"

BAG3 regulates the specificity of the recognition of specific MAPT species by NBR1 and SQSTM1.,"Macroautophagy/autophagy receptors are essential for the recognition and clearance of specific cargos by selective autophagy, which is essential for maintaining MAPT proteostasis. Previous studies have implicated different autophagy receptors in directing distinct species of MAPT to autophagy, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Here we examine how the autophagy receptors NBR1 and SQSTM1 differentially associate with specific forms of MAPT. In primary neurons depletion of NBR1, unlike depletion of SQSTM1, significantly increased phosphorylated MAPT levels. The specificity of the interactions was confirmed using in vitro binding assays with purified proteins. We provide direct evidence that the co-chaperone BAG3 promotes the preferential association of NBR1 with monomeric MAPT and SQSTM1 with oligomeric MAPT. Using an in vitro affinity-isolation assay, we show that SQSTM1 only binds to monomeric MAPT when BAG3 is absent and fails to bind when BAG3 is present. The opposite is true of NBR1; its association with monomeric MAPT was dependent on the presence of BAG3. Interestingly, in Alzheimer disease brain the association of NBR1 with BAG3 was significantly decreased. In a mouse model, ablation of BAG3 in neural cells disrupted the association of NBR1 with phosphorylated MAPT and led to increased levels of phosphorylated and oligomeric MAPT. Overall, our results uncover a novel role for BAG3 in regulating the specificity of selective autophagy receptors in targeting different species of MAPT and provide compelling evidence that BAG3 plays a key role in maintaining MAPT proteostasis.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Autophagy receptor; BAG3; MAPT; NBR1; SQSTM1,"Mice; Animals; Sequestosome-1 Protein; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Alzheimer Disease; Autophagy; Carrier Proteins","Lin, H; Sandkuhler, S; Dunlea, C; Rodwell-Bullock, J; King, DH; Johnson, GVW"

Alteration of Metabolic Profiles during the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.,"(1) Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that threatens the population health of older adults. However, the mechanisms of the altered metabolism involved in AD pathology are poorly understood. The aim of the study was to identify the potential biomarkers of AD and discover the metabolomic changes produced during the progression of the disease. (2) Methods: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to measure the concentrations of the serum metabolites in a cohort of subjects with AD (n = 88) and a cognitively normal control (CN) group (n = 85). The patients were classified as very mild (n = 25), mild (n = 27), moderate (n = 25), and severe (n = 11). The serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using multivariate and univariate approaches. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to identify the potential biomarkers of AD. Biofunctional enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. (3) Results: Our results revealed considerable separation between the AD and CN groups. Six metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of AD (AUC > 0.85), and the diagnostic model of three metabolites could predict the risk of AD with high accuracy (AUC = 0.984). The metabolic enrichment analysis revealed that carbohydrate metabolism deficiency and the disturbance of amino acid, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism were involved in AD progression. Especially, the pathway analysis highlighted that l-glutamate participated in four crucial nervous system pathways (including the GABAergic synapse, the glutamatergic synapse, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, and the synaptic vesicle cycle). (4) Conclusions: Carbohydrate metabolism deficiency and amino acid dysregulation, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism disorders were pivotal events in AD progression. Our study may provide novel insights into the role of metabolic disorders in AD pathogenesis and identify new markers for AD diagnosis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; metabolic pathway; metabolomics; serum metabolic change,,"Yu, W; Chen, L; Li, X; Han, T; Yang, Y; Hu, C; Yu, W; Lü, Y"
The Connection between Chronic Liver Damage and Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease: Evidence and Insights from a Rat Model.,"Junk foods are typically low in essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are also loaded with trans fats and saturated fats, which can increase the level of triglycerides in the blood. High triglyceride levels can contribute to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver. A high intake of junk foods can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin. A diet lacking in nutrients and loaded with unwanted toxins can impair the liver's ability to detoxify harmful substances and damage its overall function. It is known that the regular consumption of junk food can be linked to memory impairment and cognitive decline. Several studies have shown that diets high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and processed foods can negatively impact brain health, including memory function. In this study, Wistar rats were used to model Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD), which was inspired by knowledge of the liver-brain axis's role in causing dementia. The model mimicked junk-food-induced liver-brain damage, and was developed by using the toxins d-galactosamine, ethanol and d-galactose. To begin with, the model rats demonstrated insulin resistance, a characteristic of LOAD patients. Glucose levels in both the brain and liver tissues were significantly elevated in the model, paralleling clinical findings in LOAD patients. High glucose levels in the brain lead to the increased production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which, along with amyloid beta, harm neighbouring neurons. Histopathological analysis revealed deformed glial nodules, apoptotic neurons, and amyloid plaques in the brain section in the later stages of the disease. Simultaneously, the liver section displayed features of cirrhosis, including an effaced lobular architecture and the extravasation of red blood cells. Liver enzymes ALT, AST and ALP were consistently elevated with disease progression. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the diseased brain. The positive expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 3-Alpha (HIF3A) in the brain indicated hypoxic conditions, which is consistent with other LOAD studies. This model also exhibited damaged intestinal villi and excessive bowel and urinary incontinence, indicating malnutrition and a disturbed gut microbiome, which is also consistent with LOAD patients. Bioinformatics analysis on serum protein suggests a few affected molecular pathways, like the amyloid secretase pathway, androgen/oestrogen/progesterone biosynthesis, the apoptosis signalling pathway, the insulin/IGF pathway-protein kinase B signalling cascade, the Metabotropic glutamate receptor group I pathway, the Wnt signalling pathway, etc. Behavioural analysis confirmed memory decline and the loss of muscle strength with disease progression. Overall, this rat model of LOAD sheds valuable light on LOAD pathology and highlights the potential link between liver dysfunction, particularly induced by the excessive consumption of junk food, and LOAD. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in LOAD, paving the way for new possibilities in therapeutic interventions.",2023,ALT; APP; Alzheimer’s disease; brain; junk food; liver,,"Jakhmola Mani, R; Dogra, N; Katare, DP"
Peripheral Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of YKL-40 in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is particularly complicated, and early diagnosis and course monitoring of the disease are not ideal based on the available core biomarkers. As a biomarker closely related to neuroinflammation, YKL-40 provides a potential scalable approach in AD, but its association remains controversial and inconclusive with AD. We conducted this study to assess the utility of YKL-40 levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) by meta-analysis. We systematically searched and screened relevant trials for comparing YKL-40 levels between AD patients and HCs in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a search deadline of 14 March 2023 for each database. A total of 17 eligible and relevant studies involving 1811 subjects, including 949 AD patients and 862 HCs, were included. The results showed that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral blood of AD patients and HCs did not possess significant differences. Subgroup analysis showed YKL-40 significantly differed in plasma (SMD = 0.527, 95%CI: [0.302, 0.752]; ",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; YKL-40; biomarkers; blood; cerebrospinal fluid; meta-analysis,,"Zhang, Y; Tian, J; Ni, J; Wei, M; Li, T; Shi, J"

Chronic kidney disease causes blood-brain barrier breakdown via urea-activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 and insolubility of tau protein.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes cognitive impairment and contributes to the overall global burden of dementia. However, mechanisms through which the kidneys and brain communicate are not fully understood. We established a CKD mouse model through adenine-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Novel object recognition tests indicated that CKD decreased recognition memory. Sarkosyl-insoluble-proteomic analyses of the CKD mouse hippocampus revealed an accumulation of insoluble MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) and RNA-binding proteins such as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1 subunit 70 (SNRNP70). Additionally, there was an accumulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. We identified that expressions of essential tight-junction protein claudin-5 and adherens-junction protein platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) were decreased in the brain endothelial cells of CKD mice. We determined urea as a major uremic solute that dose dependently decreased both claudin-5 and PECAM-1 expression in the mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 cells. Gelatin zymography indicated that the serum of CKD mice activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), while marimastat ameliorated the reduction of claudin-5 expression by urea in bEnd.3 cells. This study established a brain proteomic signature of CKD indicating BBB breakdown and insolubility of tau protein, which are pathologically linked to Alzheimer's disease. Urea-mediated activation of MMP2 was partly responsible for BBB breakdown in CKD.",2023,blood brain barrier; chronic kidney disease; cognitive impairment; proteomics; urea,"Animals; Mice; Blood-Brain Barrier; Claudin-5; Endothelial Cells; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Proteomics; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; tau Proteins","Matsuki, H; Mandai, S; Shiwaku, H; Koide, T; Takahashi, N; Yanagi, T; Inaba, S; Ida, S; Fujiki, T; Mori, Y; Ando, F; Mori, T; Susa, K; Iimori, S; Sohara, E; Takahashi, H; Uchida, S"

Associations Between Blood Nutritional Biomarkers and Cerebral Amyloid-β: Insights From the COGFRAIL Cohort Study.,"Understanding the relationship between blood nutrients and neurodegeneration could contribute to devising strategies for preventing Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the associations between fatty acids, vitamins D, B6, B12, folate, homocysteine, and the cerebral load of amyloid β (Aβ). This cross-sectional study included 177 older adults (70-96 years, 65% female) with objective cognitive impairment, prefrail, or frail. Cerebral Aβ load was determined using positron emission tomography Standardized Uptake Value ratios. Fatty acids were assessed in erythrocytes, vitamins D and homocysteine in serum, and the other vitamins in plasma. Linear regression models corrected for multiple comparisons evaluated the associations between each nutrient and Aβ. The principal component factor followed by linear regression grouped the fatty acids strongly correlated (factor) and associated with Aβ. Higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): clupanodonic acid (22:5n-3; β: -0.13; p = .001), mead acid (20:3n-9; β: -0.07; p = .036), and adrenic acid (22:4n-6; β: -0.05; p = .031) were associated with lower global Aβ load, whereas linoleic acid (18:2n-6) was associated with higher global Aβ load (β: 0.18; p = .042). Clupanodonic acid was inversely associated with Aβ in all cerebral regions except the thalamus. The factor composed of mead, clupanodonic, and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids was associated with a lower global Aβ load (β: -0.02; p = .002). Some erythrocyte PUFAs were inversely associated with Aβ load in the brain, and most of them were metabolites of the essential fatty acids linoleic and α-linolenic. Given the cross-sectional design, these results must be carefully interpreted, and longitudinal studies are needed.",2024,Fatty acids; Neurodegeneration; Vitamins,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fatty Acids; Homocysteine; Positron-Emission Tomography; Vitamins,"Grande de França, NA; Díaz, G; Lengelé, L; Soriano, G; Caspar-Bauguil, S; Saint-Aubert, L; Payoux, P; Rouch, L; Vellas, B; de Souto Barreto, P; Sourdet, S"

Metallic Nanocarriers for Therapeutic Peptides: Emerging Solutions Addressing the Delivery Challenges in Brain Ailments.,"Peptides and proteins have recently emerged as efficient therapeutic alternatives to conventional therapies. Although they emerged a few decades back, extensive exploration of various ailments or disorders began recently. The drawbacks of current chemotherapies and irradiation treatments, such as drug resistance and damage to healthy tissues, have enabled the rise of peptides in the quest for better prospects. The chemical tunability and smaller size make them easy to design selectively for target tissues. Other remarkable properties include antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, protection from hemorrhage stroke, and as therapeutic agents for gastric disorders and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Despite these unmatched properties, their practical applicability is often hindered due to their weak susceptibility to enzymatic digestion, serum degradation, liver metabolism, kidney clearance, and immunogenic reactions. Several methods are adapted to increase the half-life of peptides, such as chemical modifications, fusing with Fc fragment, change in amino acid composition, and carrier-based delivery. Among these, nanocarrier-mediated encapsulation not only increases the half-life of the peptides in vivo but also aids in the targeted delivery. Despite its structural complexity, they also efficiently deliver therapeutic molecules across the blood-brain barrier. Here, in this review, we tried to emphasize the possible potentiality of metallic nanoparticles to be used as an efficient peptide delivery system against brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this review, we have emphasized the various therapeutic applications of peptides/proteins, including antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. We also focused on these peptides' challenges under physiological conditions after administration. We highlighted the importance and potentiality of metallic nanocarriers in the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, increasing the stability and half-life of peptides, their efficiency in targeting the delivery, and their diagnostic applications.",2024,,Humans; Drug Carriers; Nanoparticles; Brain; Blood-Brain Barrier; Peptides; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Drug Delivery Systems,"Rathnam, SS; Deepak, T; Sahoo, BN; Meena, T; Singh, Y; Joshi, A"

Microbiota from Alzheimer's patients induce deficits in cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder leading to a decline in cognitive function and mental health. Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms. To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; adult hippocampal neurogenesis; faecal microbiota transplantation; memory,Humans; Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Hippocampus; Cognition; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Neurogenesis,"Grabrucker, S; Marizzoni, M; Silajdžić, E; Lopizzo, N; Mombelli, E; Nicolas, S; Dohm-Hansen, S; Scassellati, C; Moretti, DV; Rosa, M; Hoffmann, K; Cryan, JF; O'Leary, OF; English, JA; Lavelle, A; O'Neill, C; Thuret, S; Cattaneo, A; Nolan, YM"

Supplementation of Medium-Chain Triglycerides Combined with Docosahexaenoic Acid Inhibits Amyloid Beta Protein Deposition by Improving Brain Glucose Metabolism in APP/PS1 Mice.,"The deterioration of brain glucose metabolism predates the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) positively improve brain glucose metabolism and decrease the expression of AD-related proteins. However, the effects of the combined intervention are unclear. The present study explored the effects of the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA in improving brain glucose metabolism and decreasing AD-related protein expression levels in APP/PS1 mice. The mice were assigned into four dietary treatment groups: the control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. The corresponding diet of the respective groups was fed to mice from the age of 3 to 11 months. The results showed that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could increase serum octanoic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), DHA, and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) levels; improve glucose metabolism; and reduce nerve cell apoptosis in the brain. Moreover, it also aided with decreasing the expression levels of amyloid beta protein (Aβ), amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1) in the brain. Furthermore, the supplementation of MCTs + DHA was significantly more beneficial than that of MCTs or DHA alone. In conclusion, the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could improve energy metabolism in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, thus decreasing nerve cell apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of Aβ.",2023,18F-FDG-PET-CT; APP/PS1 mouse; Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid beta protein; docosahexaenoic acid; glucose metabolism; medium-chain triglycerides,"Mice; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Presenilin-1; Mice, Transgenic; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Disease Models, Animal; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Dietary Supplements; Triglycerides","Wang, Z; Zhang, D; Cheng, C; Lin, Z; Zhou, D; Sun, Y; Li, W; Yan, J; Luo, S; Qian, Z; Li, Z; Huang, G"
Effects of autologous serum on TREM2 and APOE in a personalized monocyte-derived macrophage assay of late-onset Alzheimer's patients.,"Age-associated deterioration of the immune system contributes to a chronic low-grade inflammatory state known as ""inflammaging"" and is implicated in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Whether changes in the tissue environment caused by circulatory factors associated with aging may alter the innate immune response is unknown. Monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-MФs) infiltrating the brain alongside microglia are postulated to play a modulatory role in LOAD and both express triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) acts as a ligand for TREM2, and their role in amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance highlights their importance in LOAD. However, the influence of the patient's own milieu (autologous serum) on the synthesis of TREM2 and APOE in infiltrating macrophages remains unknown.",2023,APOE; Amyloid-beta uptake; Inflammaging; Late-onset Alzheimer's disease; Monocyte-derived macrophages; Patient-derived personalized assay; Sex differences; TREM2,,"Eren, N; Gerike, S; Üsekes, B; Peters, O; Cosma, NC; Hellmann-Regen, J"
Accumulation of β-Amyloid Leads to a Decrease in Lynx1 and Lypd6B Expression in the Hippocampus and Increased Expression of Proinflammatory Cytokines in the Hippocampus and Blood Serum.,"Alzheimer's disease is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease, the development of which is associated with the accumulation of β-amyloid oligomers, dysfunction of the α7-nAChR nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and activation of inflammation. Previously, we showed that the neuromodulator Lynx1, which belongs to the Ly6/uPAR family, competes with β-amyloid(1-42) for binding to α7-nAChR. In this work, we studied the expression and localization of Ly6/uPAR family proteins in the hippocampus of 2xTg-AD transgenic mice that model AD and demonstrate increased amyloidosis in the brain. Using real-time PCR, we showed a decrease in the expression of the genes encoding Lynx1, Lypd6b, and the postsynaptic marker PSD95, as well as an increase in the expression of the TNFα gene in the hippocampus of 2xTg-AD mice. Histochemical analysis showed that, in the hippocampus of 2xTg-AD mice, Lynx1 does not colocalize with α7-nAChR, which can lead to the development of pathology when the receptor interacts with oligomeric β-amyloid. In addition, in 2xTg-AD mice, activation of systemic inflammation was shown, which manifests itself in a decrease in the serum level of SLURP-1, a Ly6/uPAR family protein capable of regulating inflammatory processes, as well as in an increase in the content of proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and TNFβ. Thus, α7-nAChR dysfunction and maintenance of the inflammatory microenvironment in the brain in Alzheimer's disease may be associated with a decrease in the expression of Ly6/uPAR family proteins that regulate α7-nAChR activity and inflammation.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Ly6/uPAR; Lynx1; Lypd6b; SLURP-1; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,"Animals; Mice; alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cytokines; Hippocampus; Inflammation; Mice, Transgenic; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Receptors, Nicotinic; Serum; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Bychkov, ML; Kirichenko, AV; Paramonov, AS; Kirpichnikov, MP; Lukmanova, EN"

Serum PAI-1/BDNF Ratio Is Increased in Alzheimer's Disease and Correlates with Disease Severity.,"We previously demonstrated that serum levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which inhibits both the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasmin activity, are increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. tPA/plasmin not only prevents the accumulation of β-amyloid in the brain but also is involved in the synthesis of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin whose levels are reduced in Alzheimer. In the present study, we compared BDNF serum levels in Alzheimer patients with dementia to those in Alzheimer patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and to cognitively healthy controls. Moreover, we examined whether the PAI-1/BDNF ratio correlates with disease severity, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination. Our results showed that BDNF serum levels are lower (13.7% less) and PAI-1 levels are higher in Alzheimer patients with dementia than in Alzheimer patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients (23% more) or controls (36% more). Furthermore, the PAI-1/BDNF ratio was significantly increased in Alzheimer patients as compared to amnestic mild cognitive impairment (36.4% more) and controls (40% more). Lastly, the PAI-1/BDNF ratio negatively correlated with the Mini-Mental score. Our results suggest that increased PAI-1 levels in Alzheimer, by impairing the production of the BDNF, are implicated in disease progression. They also indicate that the PAI-1/BDNF ratio could be used as a marker of Alzheimer.

To test the idea that circulating factors mediate age-dependent changes in peripheral rhythms, we compared the ability of human serum from young and old individuals to synchronize circadian rhythms in culture. We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25-30) and old (age 70-76) individuals at 14:00 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts. We found that young and old sera are equally competent at initiating robust ~24h oscillations of a luciferase reporter driven by clock gene promoter. However, cyclic gene expression is affected, such that young and old sera promote cycling of different sets of genes. Genes that lose rhythmicity with old serum entrainment are associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer's Disease as identified by STRING and IPA analyses. Conversely, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increased in the cells entrained with old serum. Genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions. We did not observe a global difference in the distribution of phase between groups, but found that peak expression of several clock-controlled genes (",2024,,,"Schwarz, JE; Mrčela, A; Lahens, NF; Li, Y; Hsu, CT; Grant, G; Skarke, C; Zhang, SL; Sehgal, A"

[Xixin Decoction improves learning and memory ability of SAMP8 by enhancing neuroprotective effect and inhibiting neuroinflammation].,"This study aimed to explore the possible effect of Xixin Decoction(XXD) on the learning and memory ability of Alzheimer's disease(AD) model senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8(SAMP8) and the related mechanism in enhancing neuroprotective effect and reducing neuroinflammation. Forty SAMP8 were randomly divided into a model group(10 mL·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)), a probiotics group(0.39 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)), a high-dose group of XXD granules(H-XXD, 5.07 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)), a medium-dose group of XXD granules(M-XXD, 2.535 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)), and a low-dose group of XXD granules(L-XXD, 1.267 5 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)). Eight senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1(SAMR1) of the same age and strain were assigned to the control group(10 mL·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)). After ten weeks of intragastric administration, the Morris water maze was used to test the changes in spatial learning and memory ability of mice after treatment. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the positive expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products(AGER), Toll-like receptor 1(TLR1), and Toll-like receptor 2(TLR2) in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice. Western blot was employed to test the protein expression levels of silencing information regulator 2 related enzyme 1(SIRT1), AGER, TLR1, and TLR2 in the hippocampus of mice. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) was applied to assess the levels of Aβ_(1-42) in the hippocampus of mice and the levels of nuclear factor κB p65(NF-κB p65), NOD-like receptor protein 3(NLRP3), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), and interleukin-1β(IL-1β) in the serum and hippocampus of mice. Compared with the model group, XXD significantly improved the spatial learning and memory ability of SAMP8, increased the expression of neuroprotective factors in the hippocampus, decreased the levels of neuroinflammatory factors, and inhibited the expression of Aβ_(1-42). In particular, H-XXD significantly increased the expression of SIRT1 in the hippocampus of mice, reduced the expression levels of NF-κB p65, NLRP3, TNF-α, and IL-1β in the serum and hippocampus of mice, and decreased the expression of AGER, TLR1, and TLR2 in the hippocampus of mice(P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01).

[Serum metabolomics study of Psoraleae Fructus in improving learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice].,"This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of Psoraleae Fructus in improving the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice by serum metabolomics, screen the differential metabolites of Psoraleae Fructus on APP/PS1 mice, and reveal its influence on the metabolic pathway of APP/PS1 mice. Thirty 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into a model group and a Psoraleae Fructus extract group, and another 15 C57BL/6 mice of the same age were assigned to the blank group. The learning and memory ability of mice was evaluated by the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests, and metabolomics was used to analyze the metabolites in mouse serum. The results of the Morris water maze test showed that Psoraleae Fructus shortened the escape latency of APP/PS1 mice(P&lt;0.01), and increased the number of platform crossing and residence time in the target quadrant(P&lt;0.01). The results of the novel object recognition test showed that Psoraleae Fructus could improve the novel object recognition index of APP/PS1 mice(P&lt;0.01). Eighteen differential metabolites in serum were screened out by metabolomics, among which the levels of arachidonic acid, tryptophan, and glycerophospholipid decreased after drug administration, while the levels of glutamyltyrosine increased after drug administration. The metabolic pathways involved included arachidonic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, α-linolenic acid metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. Therefore, Psoraleae Fructus can improve the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice, and its mechanism may be related to the effects in promoting energy metabolism, reducing oxidative damage, protecting central nervous system, reducing neuroinflammation, and reducing Aβ deposition. This study is expected to provide references for Psoraleae Fructus in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease(AD) and further explain the mechanism of Psoraleae Fructus in the treatment of AD.",2023,APP/PS1; Alzheimer′s disease; Psoraleae Fructus; energy metabolism; metabolomics,"Mice; Animals; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Mice, Transgenic; Arachidonic Acid; Tryptophan; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Alzheimer Disease; Maze Learning; Glycerophospholipids; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Gu, JM; Xue, H; Xue, A; Jiang, J; Geng, F; Zhao, JH; Yang, B; Zhang, N"

"Longitudinal associations of serum biomarkers with early cognitive, amyloid and grey matter changes.","Blood-based biomarkers have been extensively evaluated for their diagnostic potential in Alzheimer's disease. However, their relative prognostic and monitoring capabilities for cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and grey matter loss in cognitively unimpaired elderly require further investigation over extended time periods. This prospective cohort study in cognitively unimpaired elderly [n = 185, mean age (range) = 69 (53-84) years, 48% female] examined the prognostic and monitoring capabilities of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and phosphorylated tau (pTau)181 through their quantification in serum. All participants underwent baseline Aβ-PET, MRI and blood sampling as well as 2-yearly cognitive testing. A subset additionally underwent Aβ-PET (n = 109), MRI (n = 106) and blood sampling (n = 110) during follow-up [median time interval (range) = 6.1 (1.3-11.0) years]. Matching plasma measurements were available for Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and pTau181 (both n = 140). Linear mixed-effects models showed that high serum GFAP and NfL predicted future cognitive decline in memory (βGFAP×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.007 and βNfL×Time = -0.031, PFDR = 0.002) and language (βGFAP×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.002 and βNfL×Time = -0.018, PFDR = 0.03) domains. Low serum Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 equally but independently predicted memory decline (βAβ1-42/Aβ1-40×Time = -0.024, PFDR = 0.02). Whole-brain voxelwise analyses revealed that low Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 predicted Aβ accumulation within the precuneus and frontal regions, high GFAP and NfL predicted grey matter loss within hippocampal regions and low Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 predicted grey matter loss in lateral temporal regions. Serum GFAP, NfL and pTau181 increased over time, while Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 decreased only in Aβ-PET-negative elderly. NfL increases associated with declining memory (βNfLchange×Time = -0.030, PFDR = 0.006) and language (βNfLchange×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.02) function and serum Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 decreases associated with declining language function (βAβ1-42/Aβ1-40×Time = -0.020, PFDR = 0.04). GFAP increases associated with Aβ accumulation within the precuneus and NfL increases associated with grey matter loss. Baseline and longitudinal serum pTau181 only associated with Aβ accumulation in restricted occipital regions. In head-to-head comparisons, serum outperformed plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 (ΔAUC = 0.10, PDeLong, FDR = 0.04), while both plasma and serum pTau181 demonstrated poor performance to detect asymptomatic Aβ-PET positivity (AUC = 0.55 and 0.63, respectively). However, when measured with a more phospho-specific assay, plasma pTau181 detected Aβ-positivity with high performance (AUC = 0.82, PDeLong, FDR < 0.007). In conclusion, serum GFAP, NfL and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 are valuable prognostic and/or monitoring tools in asymptomatic stages providing complementary information in a time- and pathology-dependent manner.",2024,blood biomarkers; monitoring; positron emission tomography; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease; prognosis,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Gray Matter; Prospective Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Positron-Emission Tomography,"De Meyer, S; Blujdea, ER; Schaeverbeke, J; Reinartz, M; Luckett, ES; Adamczuk, K; Van Laere, K; Dupont, P; Teunissen, CE; Vandenberghe, R; Poesen, K"

The Cracked Potential of Boron-containing Compounds in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a relevant neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Its relevancy is mainly due to its high prevalence and high global burden. Metalloids have attracted attention as their serum levels seem to differ between affected patients and healthy individuals. On the other hand, atoms of some metalloids have been included in bioactive molecules, exerting some interesting effects, mainly due to their ameliorative effects in neurodegeneration. In this sense, boron-containing compounds (BCC) have been explored to regulate or prevent neurodegeneration. As an example, boric acid has been reported as a compound with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects. Other natural BCCs have also shown amelioration of metabolic conditions often related to increased risk of neurodegenerative maladies. However, in recent years, additional organoboron compounds have been reported as active in several processes linked to neurodegeneration and especially attractive as regulators of the origin and progression of AD. In this mini-review, some data are collected suggesting that some natural BCC could be used as preventive agents, but also the potential of some BODIPYs as tools for diagnosis and some other BCC (particularly boronic acids and pinacol boronic esters) for acting as promising therapeutic agents for AD.",2023,alzheimer; amyloid; bodipy; boron; boronic; neurodegeneration,,"Soriano-Ursúa, MA; Farfán-García, ED"

Identification of Candidate Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease via Multiplex Cerebrospinal Fluid and Serum Proteomics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia among elderly people worldwide. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the optimal fluid source for AD biomarkers, while serum biomarkers are much more achievable. To search for novel diagnostic AD biomarkers, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of CSF and serum samples from AD and normal cognitive controls (NC). CSF and serum proteomes were analyzed via data-independent acquisition quantitative mass spectrometry. Our bioinformatic analysis was based on Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment. In comparison to the controls, 8 proteins were more abundant in AD CSF, and 60 were less abundant in AD CSF, whereas 55 proteins were more and 10 were less abundant in the serum samples. ATPase-associated activity for CSF and mitochondrial functions for CSF and serum were the most enriched GO terms of the DEPs. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the most significant pathways for the differentially expressed proteins were the N-glycan biosynthesis pathways. The area under the curve (AUC) values for CSF sodium-/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 (AT1B1), serglycin (SRGN), and thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, mitochondrial (PRDX3) were 0.867 (",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; bioinformatics analysis; differentially expressed proteins; proteomes,Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Proteomics; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Area Under Curve; Biomarkers,"Liu, P; Li, L; He, F; Meng, F; Liu, X; Su, Y; Su, X; Luo, B; Peng, G"
Adipocyte-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles from Patients with Alzheimer Disease Carry miRNAs Predicted to Target the CREB Signaling Pathway in Neurons.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction, and progressive dementia. Midlife obesity increases the risk of developing AD. Adipocyte-derived small extracellular vesicles (ad-sEVs) have been implicated as a mechanism in several obesity-related diseases. We hypothesized that ad-sEVs from patients with AD would contain miRNAs predicted to downregulate pathways involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We isolated ad-sEVs from the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD and controls and compared miRNA expression profiles. We performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on differentially expressed miRNAs to identify highly interconnected clusters correlating with clinical traits. The WGCNA identified a module of differentially expressed miRNAs, in both the serum and CSF, that was inversely correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Within this module, miRNAs that downregulate CREB signaling in neurons were highly represented. These results demonstrate that miRNAs carried by ad-sEVs in patients with AD may downregulate CREB signaling and provide a potential mechanistic link between midlife obesity and increased risk of AD.",2023,EVs; adipose tissue; dementia; exosomes; obesity,"Humans; Adipocytes; Alzheimer Disease; Extracellular Vesicles; MicroRNAs; Neurons; Obesity; Plaque, Amyloid; Signal Transduction","Batabyal, RA; Bansal, A; Cechinel, LR; Authelet, K; Goldberg, M; Nadler, E; Keene, CD; Jayadev, S; Domoto-Reilly, K; Li, G; Peskind, E; Hashimoto-Torii, K; Buchwald, D; Freishtat, RJ"

Direct Competition of ATCUN Peptides with Human Serum Albumin for Copper(II) Ions Determined by LC-ICP MS.,"Copper is an indispensable biometal, primarily serving as a redox-competent cofactor in numerous proteins.

These motifs are common for serum albumin, but they are also present in a wide range of proteins and peptides. These proteins and peptides can be involved in copper metabolism, and copper ions can affect their biological role. The distribution of copper between the ATCUN peptides, including truncated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides Aβ4-42 and Aβ11-42, which may be involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, is mainly determined by their concentrations and relative Cu(II)-binding affinities.

Tau suppresses microtubule-regulated pancreatic insulin secretion.,"Tau protein is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, but its physiological function is in debate. Mostly explored in the brain, tau is also expressed in the pancreas. We further explored the mechanism of tau's involvement in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in islet β-cells, and established a potential relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and AD. We demonstrate that pancreatic tau is crucial for insulin secretion regulation and glucose homeostasis. Tau levels were found to be elevated in β-islet cells of patients with T2DM, and loss of tau enhanced insulin secretion in cell lines, drosophila, and mice. Pharmacological or genetic suppression of tau in the db/db diabetic mouse model normalized glucose levels by promoting insulin secretion and was recapitulated by pharmacological inhibition of microtubule assembly. Clinical studies further showed that serum tau protein was positively correlated with blood glucose levels in healthy controls, which was lost in AD.

A murine model of BSCL2-associated Celia's encephalopathy.,"Celia's encephalopathy or progressive encephalopathy with/without lipodystrophy is a neurodegenerative disease with a fatal prognosis in childhood. It is generally caused by the c.985C > T variant in the BSCL2 gene, leading to the skipping of exon 7 and resulting in an aberrant seipin protein (Celia-seipin).

The comprehensive mechanism underlying Schisandra polysaccharide in AD-like symptoms of Aβ25-35-induced rats based on hippocampal metabolomics and serum lipidomics techniques.,"As is well documented, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Meanwhile, Schisandra polysaccharide (SCP) has been reported to exert a protective effect on the nervous system and can regulate metabolic disorders in AD-like symptoms of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) 25-35-induced rats. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms and metabolic markers for the diagnosis of AD are yet to be determined. This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effect and potential mechanism of action of SCP in AD-like symptoms of Aβ25-35-induced rats by combining pharmacodynamics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. The pharmacodynamic results revealed that SCP significantly improved the spatial learning and long-term memory function and the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region, alleviated inflammatory damage and oxidative stress, inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and increased the proportion of mature neurons of AD-like symptoms of Aβ25-35-induced rats. The results of hippocampal metabolomics and serum lipidomics showed 46 and 48 potential biomarkers were identified for the SCP treatment of AD, respectively. The involved pathways principally comprised lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism. This study elucidates the neuroprotective effect of SCP in AD and its mechanism from the perspective of metabolomics and lipidomics and provides a theoretical basis for the therapeutic effect of SCP in AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Lipidomics; Mechanism; Metabolomics; Schisandra polysaccharide,,"Zhao, S; Zhang, J; Chen, Y; Cui, X; Liu, H; Yan, Y; Sun, Y; Qi, Y; Liu, Y"

SIRT2 Inhibition Rescues Neurodegenerative Pathology but Increases Systemic Inflammation in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) has been proposed to have a central role on aging, inflammation, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases; however, its specific function remains controversial. Recent studies propose SIRT2 pharmacological inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Surprisingly, none of these published studies regarding the potential interest of SIRT2 inhibition has assessed the peripheral adverse side consequences of this treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that the specific SIRT2 inhibitor, the compound 33i, does not exhibit genotoxic or mutagenic properties. Moreover, pharmacological treatment with 33i, improved cognitive dysfunction and long-term potentiation, reducing amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model. However, this treatment increased peripheral levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF, IL-6 and MCP-1. Accordingly, peripheral SIRT2 inhibition with the blood brain barrier impermeable compound AGK-2, worsened the cognitive capacities and increased systemic inflammation. The analysis of human samples revealed that SIRT2 is increased in the brain but not in the serum of AD patients. These results suggest that, although SIRT2 pharmacological inhibition may have beneficial consequences in neurodegenerative diseases, its pharmacological inhibition at the periphery would not be recommended and the systemic adverse side effects should be considered. This information is essential to maximize the therapeutic potential of SIRT2 inhibition not only for AD but also for other neurodegenerative diseases.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Inflammation; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroinflammation; Sirtuin 2,"Animals; Humans; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Inflammation; Mice, Transgenic; Sirtuin 2; Neurodegenerative Diseases","Sola-Sevilla, N; Mesa-Lombardo, A; Aleixo, M; Expósito, S; Diaz-Perdigón, T; Azqueta, A; Zamani, F; Suzuki, T; Maioli, S; Eroli, F; Matton, A; Ramírez, MJ; Solas, M; Tordera, RM; Martín, ED; Puerta, E"

"Preservation of Biomarkers Associated with Alzheimer's Disease (Amyloid Peptides 1-38, 1-40, 1-42, Tau Protein, Beclin 1) in the Blood of Neonates after Perinatal Asphyxia.","Perinatal asphyxia is a complex disease involving massive death of brain cells in full-term newborns. The most impressive consequence of perinatal asphyxia is a neurodegenerative brain injury called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Management of newborns after perinatal asphyxia is very difficult due to the lack of measurable biomarkers that would be able to assess the severity of the brain injury in the future, help in the selection of therapy, assess the results of treatment and determine the prognosis for the future. Thus, these limitations make long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes unpredictable during life. Quantifying biomarkers that can detect subclinical changes at a stage where routine brain monitoring or imaging is still mute would be a major advance in the care of neonates with brain neurodegeneration after asphyxia. Understanding the effect of perinatal asphyxia on changes in blood neurodegenerative biomarkers over time, which would be commonly used to assess the severity of postpartum encephalopathy, would be an important step in developing precision in predicting the consequences of brain injuries. We urgently need more accurate early predictive markers to guide clinicians when to use neuroprotective therapy. The needed neurodegenerative biomarkers may represent neuronal pathological changes that can be recognized by new technologies such as genomic and proteomic. Nevertheless, the simultaneous blood tau protein and various amyloid changes with the addition of an autophagy marker beclin 1 after perinatal asphyxia have not been studied. We decided to evaluate serum biomarkers of neuronal injury characteristic for Alzheimer's disease such as amyloid peptides (1-38, 1-40 and 1-42), tau protein and beclin 1, which can predict the progression of brain neurodegeneration in future. In this paper, we report for the first time the significant changes in the above molecules in the blood after asphyxia compared to healthy controls during the 1-7, 8-14 and 15+ days ELISA test.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; autophagy; beclin 1; biomarkers; blood; perinatal asphyxia; tau protein,"Infant, Newborn; Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Beclin-1; Asphyxia; Proteomics; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Brain Injuries; Biomarkers","Tarkowska, A; Furmaga-Jabłońska, W; Bogucki, J; Kocki, J; Pluta, R"

Interfacial Self-assembly of Chiral Selenide Nanomembrane for Enantiospecific Recognition.,"Here, we report the synthesis of chiral selenium nanoparticles (NPs) using cysteine and the interfacial assembly strategy to generate a self-assembled nanomembrane on a large-scale with controllable morphology and handedness. The selenide (Se) NPs exhibited circular dichroism (CD) bands in the ultraviolet and visible region with a maximum intensity of 39.96 mdeg at 388 nm and optical anisotropy factors (g-factors) of up to 0.0013 while a self-assembled monolayer nanomembrane exhibited symmetrical CD approaching 72.8 mdeg at 391 nm and g-factors up to 0.0034. Analysis showed that a photocurrent of 20.97±1.55 nA was generated by the D-nanomembrane when irradiated under light while the L-nanomembrane generated a photocurrent of 20.58±1.36 nA. Owing to the asymmetric intensity of the photocurrent with respect to the handedness of the nanomembrane, an ultrasensitive recognition of enantioselective kynurenine (Kyn) was achieved by the ten-layer (10L) D-nanomembrane exhibiting a photocurrent for L-kynurenine (L-Kyn) that was 8.64-fold lower than that of D-Kyn, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0074 nM for the L-Kyn, which was attributed to stronger affinity between L-Kyn and D-Se NPs. Noticeably, the chiral Se nanomembrane precisely distinguished L-Kyn in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy subjects.",2023,Chirality; Enantioselective Recognition; Membranes; Selenium Nanoparticle; Self-Assembly,,"Meng, D; Li, C; Hao, C; Shi, W; Xu, J; Sun, M; Kuang, H; Xu, C; Xu, L"
Ginsenoside Rh4 Alleviates Amyloid β Plaque and Tau Hyperphosphorylation by Regulating Neuroinflammation and the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β Signaling Pathway.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary neurodegenerative disease.

Therefore, it seriously threatens the mental and physical health of humans worldwide. As a traditional Chinese medicine, ginsenosides have been proven to have a variety of pharmacological activities.

Electrochemical miRNA-34a-based biosensor for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia type and a leading cause of death and disability in the elderly. Diagnosis is expensive and invasive, urging the development of new, affordable, and less invasive diagnostic tools. The identification of changes in the expression of non-coding RNAs prompts the development of diagnostic tools to detect disease-specific blood biomarkers. Building on this idea, this work reports a novel electrochemical microRNA (miRNA) biosensor for the diagnosis of AD, based on carbon screen-printed electrodes (C-SPEs) modified with two gold nanostructures and a complementary anti-miR-34a oligonucleotide probe. This biosensor showed good target affinity, reflected on a 100 pM to 1 μM linearity range and a limit of detection (LOD) of 39 pM in buffer and 94 aM in serum. Moreover, the biosensor's response was not affected by serum compounds, indicating selectivity for miR-34a. The biosensor also detected miR-34a in the cell culture medium of a common AD model, stimulated with a neurotoxin to increase miR-34a secretion. Overall, the proposed biosensor makes a solid case for the introduction of a novel, inexpensive, and minimally invasive tool for the early diagnosis of AD, based on the detection of a circulating miRNA overexpressed in this pathology.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Carbon screen-printed electrodes; Electrochemical biosensor; Gold nanoparticles; miRNA-34a,Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; MicroRNAs; Carbon; Cell Culture Techniques; Electrodes,"Pereira, RL; Oliveira, D; Pêgo, AP; Santos, SD; Moreira, FTC"

Cis P-tau is a central circulating and placental etiologic driver and therapeutic target of preeclampsia.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is the leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality globally and may trigger dementia later in life in mothers and their offspring. However, the etiological drivers remain elusive. Cis P-tau is an early etiological driver and blood biomarker in pre-clinical Alzheimer's and after vascular or traumatic brain injury, which can be targeted by stereo-specific antibody, with clinical trials ongoing. Here we find significant cis P-tau in the placenta and serum of PE patients, and in primary human trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia or sera from PE patients due to Pin1 inactivation. Depletion of cis P-tau from PE patient sera by the antibody prevents their ability to disrupt trophoblast invasion and endovascular activity and to cause the PE-like pathological and clinical features in pregnant humanized tau mice. Our studies uncover that cis P-tau is a central circulating etiological driver and its stereo-specific antibody is valuable for early PE diagnosis and treatment.",2023,,Female; Pregnancy; Humans; Animals; Mice; Placenta; Pre-Eclampsia; Causality; Trophoblasts; Antibodies; Mothers,"Jash, S; Banerjee, S; Cheng, S; Wang, B; Qiu, C; Kondo, A; Ernerudh, J; Zhou, XZ; Lu, KP; Sharma, S"

Acteoside ameliorates learning and memory impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by increasing Aβ degradation and inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are pathological hallmarks of AD. Recent studies have described the improved cognitive and neuroprotective functions of acteoside (AS). This study aimed to investigate whether the improved cognition of AS was mediated by Aβ degradation and tau phosphorylation in APP/PS1 mice. The open field, Y maze, and novel object recognition tests were used to assess cognitive behavioral changes. We evaluated the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in serum, cortex, and hippocampus, and Aβ-related scavenging enzymes, phosphorylated GSK3β and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice by western blotting. Our results revealed that AS treatment ameliorated anxious behaviors, spatial learning, and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice and significantly reduced Aβ deposition in their serum, cortex, and hippocampus. AS significantly increased Aβ degradation, inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of tau, and significantly decreased the activity of GSK3β, which is involved in tau phosphorylation. Altogether, these findings indicated that the beneficial effects of AS on AD-associated anxious behaviors and cognitive impairments could be attributed to promoting Aβ degradation and inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation, which might be partly mediated by GSK3β.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Aβ degradation; acteoside; cognitive; tau phosphorylation,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Models, Animal; Glucosides; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Memory Disorders; Mice, Transgenic; Polyphenols; tau Proteins","Gao, L; Wang, D; Ren, J; Tan, X; Chen, J; Kong, Z; Nie, Y; Yan, M"
"Gynecological surgery in adulthood imparts cognitive and brain changes in rats: A focus on hysterectomy at short-, moderate-, and long-term intervals after surgery.","Premenopausal hysterectomy is associated with a greater relative risk of dementia. We previously demonstrated cognitive impairments in adult rats six weeks after hysterectomy with ovarian conservation compared with intact sham-controls and other gynecological surgery variations. Here, we investigated whether hysterectomy-induced cognitive impairments are transient or persistent. Adult rats received sham-control, ovariectomy (Ovx), hysterectomy, or Ovx-hysterectomy surgery. Spatial working memory, reference memory, and anxiety-like behavior were tested either six-weeks post-surgery, in adulthood; seven-months post-surgery, in early middle-age; or twelve-months post-surgery, in late middle-age. Hysterectomy in adulthood yielded spatial working memory deficits at short-, moderate-, and long-term post-surgery intervals. Serum hormone levels did not differ between ovary-intact, but differed from Ovx, groups. Hysterectomy had no significant impact on healthy ovarian follicle or corpora lutea counts for any post-surgery timepoint compared with intact sham-controls. Frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex were assessed for activity-dependent markers. In entorhinal cortex, there were alterations in FOSB and ΔFOSB expression during the early middle-age timepoint, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels at the adult timepoint. Collectively, results suggest a primary role for the uterus in regulating cognition, and that memory-related neural pathways may be modified following gynecological surgery. This is the first preclinical report of long-term effects of hysterectomy with and without ovarian conservation on cognition, endocrine, ovarian, and brain assessments, initiating a comprehensive framework of gynecological surgery effects. Translationally, findings underscore critical needs to decipher how gynecological surgeries, especially those involving the uterus, impact the brain and its functions, the ovaries, and overall aging from a systems perspective.",2023,Aging; Cognition; ERK1/2; FOSB; Hysterectomy; Learning; Memory; Menopause; Ovariectomy; Rat model,Female; Humans; Rats; Animals; Hysterectomy; Ovary; Ovariectomy; Brain; Cognition; Maze Learning,"Koebele, SV; Bernaud, VE; Northup-Smith, SN; Willeman, MN; Strouse, IM; Bulen, HL; Schrier, AR; Newbern, JM; DeNardo, DF; Mayer, LP; Dyer, CA; Bimonte-Nelson, HA"

Discovery of age-related early-stage glycated proteins based on deep quantitative serum glycated proteome analysis.,"Aging is a pressing global health issue that is linked to various diseases, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. It is well known that glycation plays a pathological role in the aging process and age-related diseases. Thus, it is of great significance to discover protein glycation at an early stage for monitoring and intervention in the aging process. However, the endogenous age-related early-stage glycated proteome remains insufficiently profiled. To address this research gap, our study focuses on assessing glycated proteomics profiles in the serum of mice. We employ a robust and quantitative strategy previously developed by our team, to analyze endogenous glycated proteome in serum samples of 4 age groups of mice (10 weeks, 16 weeks, 48 weeks and 80 weeks). In total, 2959 endogenous glycated peptides corresponding to 296 serum proteins are identified from 48 runs of serum samples from 16 mice across the four age groups. By comparing these glycated peptides between adjacent age groups, we discover 49 glycated peptides from 35 proteins that show significant upregulation between the 48-week and 80-week age groups. Furthermore, we identify 10 glycated proteins (or protein groups) that are significantly upregulated only between the 48-week and 80-week age groups, including lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and apolipoprotein A-II (Apo A-II). These novel findings provide unique signatures for understanding the aging process and age-related diseases. By shedding light on the early-stage glycated proteome, our study contributes valuable insights that may have implications for future interventions and therapeutic approaches.",2023,aging; early glycation; glycated proteome,Animals; Mice; Proteome; Glycosylation; Glycated Proteins; Diabetes Mellitus; Peptides,"Ren, X; Wu, L; Zhang, L; Liu, Y; Wang, G; Lu, H"
Effect of exercise on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis dysregulation was suggested to play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the effects of exercise on HPG hormones in an AD rat model, as a possible mechanism underlying the favorable effect of exercise on AD. Forty male Wistar albino rats 2-3 months old were subdivided randomly into two groups (n = 20 each): AD group (injected intraperitoneally with aluminum chloride (70 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks) and Control group. Each group was subdivided into exercised or non-exercised group (n = 10 each). Exercised groups were subjected to a swimming protocol (60 min/day, 5 days/week, 4 weeks). Serum HPG hormones, hippocampal β-amyloid levels and Morris water-maze cognition were assessed. Results demonstrated higher levels of β-amyloid, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) together with lower testosterone levels and cognitive impairment in the AD rats compared to controls. Β-amyloid levels negatively correlated with testosterone levels and positively correlated with GnRH, LH and FSH among the AD rats. Higher testosterone and lower GnRH, LH, FSH and β-amyloid levels, as well as cognitive improvement, were observed in the exercised compared to non-exercised AD rats, suggesting a modulatory role of exercise training on AD-associated HPG axis dysregulation.",2023,,"Male; Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Rats, Wistar; Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Luteinizing Hormone; Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Human; Testosterone","Khairy, EY; Salama, OA"
Polydopamine-coated hexagonal boron nitride-based electrochemical immunosensing of T-Tau as a marker of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex pathological process that is one of the leading causes of dementia globally. The demand for diagnostic tools that are minimally invasive, timely, and accurate is on the rise. Total tau (T-Tau) protein in blood serum is a promising biomarker for predicting early-stage AD diagnosis. In this study, the hexagonal boron nitride (HBN) based immunosensor platform was developed to detect T-Tau in artificial blood serum. After the exfoliation of HBN, its surface was coated with polydopamine (PDA) in alkaline conditions. The Anti-T-Tau was immobilized on a hydrophilic nanocomposite surface using PDA's reactive catechol and quinone groups, eliminating the need for extra crosslinkers. The working electrode surface of the screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was coated with HBN-PDA nanocomposite using the drop-casting method. The biofunctional surface was created by directly immobilizing Anti-T-Tau on the HBN-PDA nanocomposite-modified SPCE. The analytical performance of the HBN-PDA/Anti-T-Tau/T-Tau immunosensor in the presence of T-Tau isoforms was determined through electrochemical measurements.

Comparative Serum and Brain Pharmacokinetics of Quercetin after Oral and Nasal Administration to Rats as Lyophilized Complexes with β-Cyclodextrin Derivatives and Their Blends with Mannitol/Lecithin Microparticles.,"Quercetin (Que) is one of the most studied flavonoids with strong antioxidant properties ascribed to its ability to bind free radicals and inactivate them. However, the low solubility of the compound along with its inadequate absorption after oral administration limit its beneficial effects. Que's complexation with two different cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives (hydroxypropyl-β-CD and methyl-β-CD) via the neutralization/lyophilization method has been found to improve its physicochemical properties. Moreover, blends of the lyophilized powders with mannitol/lecithin microparticles (MLMPs) have been proposed as candidates for intranasal (IN) administration after in vitro and ex vivo evaluations. In this context, a comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) study of the IN vs oral administration of Que lyophilized powders and their blends with MLMPs (75:25 ",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cyclodextrins; nasal powders; nose-to-brain transport; pharmacokinetics; quercetin,,"Manta, K; Papakyriakopoulou, P; Nikolidaki, A; Balafas, E; Kostomitsopoulos, N; Banella, S; Colombo, G; Valsami, G"
GV1001 Inhibits the Severity of the Ligature-Induced Periodontitis and the Vascular Lipid Deposition Associated with the Periodontitis in Mice.,"GV1001, a 16 amino acid peptide derived from the catalytic segment of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, was developed as an anti-cancer vaccine. Subsequently, it was found to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-Alzheimer's disease properties. Periodontitis is a risk factor for a variety of systemic diseases, including atherosclerosis, a process in which chronic systemic and vascular inflammation results in the formation of plaques containing lipids, macrophages, foam cells, and tissue debris on the vascular intima. Thus, we investigated the effect of GV1001 on the severity of ligature-induced periodontitis, vascular inflammation, and arterial lipid deposition in mice. GV1001 notably reduced the severity of ligature-induced periodontitis by inhibiting gingival and systemic inflammation, alveolar bone loss, and vascular inflammation in wild-type mice. It also significantly lowered the amount of lipid deposition in the arterial wall in ",2023,GV1001; atherosclerosis; periodontitis; systemic and vascular inflammation,"Humans; Animals; Mice; Endothelial Cells; Arteries; Periodontitis; Inflammation; Cancer Vaccines; Vaccines, Subunit; Atherosclerosis","Kim, SY; Kim, YJ; Kim, S; Momeni, M; Lee, A; Treanor, A; Kim, S; Kim, RH; Park, NH"
Isoniazid derivatization strategy of carboxyl-containing metabolites for LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics.,"Metabolomics is a biochemical analysis tool for identifying metabolic phenotypes and used to reveal the pathogenic mechanisms of disease and to inform drug-targeted therapies. Carboxyl-containing metabolites (CCMs) account for an important proportion of the metabolome, but because of the diversity of physical and chemical properties of CCMs in biological samples, traditional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) targeted metabolome analysis methods cannot achieve simultaneous quantification of multiple types of CCMs. Therefore, we proposed for the first time a targeted metabolomics strategy using isoniazid derivatization combined with LC-MS/MS to simultaneously quantify 39 CCMs of 5 different types (short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, bile acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolic pathway acids) with large polarity differences associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and significantly improve the detection coverage and sensitivity. The yields of isoniazid derivative CCMs were high and could guarantee the accuracy of CCM quantification. The LODs of CCMs increased significantly (1.25-2000-fold) after derivatization. The method showed good selectivity, intra-day and inter-day accuracies and precisions, and repeatability. There was no significant effect on the determination of CCMs in terms of matrix effect and recovery. CCMs showed good stability. And CCMs showed good stability under short-term storage and freeze-thaw cycles. At the same time, the regulatory effects of Schisandrae chinensis Fructus and Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma (SG) herb pair on CCM metabolic disorders in feces, urine, serum, and the brain of AD rats were elucidated from the perspective of targeted metabolomics. In combination with pharmacodynamic evaluation and gut microbiota analysis, the mechanism of SG herb pair on AD rats was comprehensively understood. In summary, this innovative isoniazid derivatization combined with a targeted metabolomics method has great potential for trace biological lineage analysis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Carboxyl-containing metabolites; Isoniazid derivatization; Targeted metabolomics,,"Wang, A; Fan, Y; Fu, J; Song, F; Liu, Z; Liu, S"
Lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in patients with Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"Lipid metabolism and oxidative stress are key mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The link between plasma lipid metabolites and oxidative stress in AD patients is poorly understood. This study was to identify markers that distinguish AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from NC, and to reveal potential links between lipid metabolites and oxidative stress. We performed non-targeted lipid metabolism analysis of plasma from patients with AD, aMCI, and NC using LC-MS/MS. The plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were assessed. We found significant differences in lipid metabolism between patients with AD and aMCI compared to those in NC. AD severity is associated with lipid metabolites, especially TG (18:0_16:0_18:0) + NH4, TG (18:0_16:0_16:0) + NH4, LPC(16:1e)-CH3, and PE (20:0_20:4)-H. SPH (d16:0) + H, SPH (d18:1) + H, and SPH (d18:0) + H were high-performance markers to distinguish AD and aMCI from NC. The AUC of three SPHs combined to predict AD was 0.990, with specificity and sensitivity as 0.949 and 1, respectively; the AUC of three SPHs combined to predict aMCI was 0.934, with specificity and sensitivity as 0.900, 0.981, respectively. Plasma MDA concentrations were higher in the AD group than in the NC group (p = 0.003), whereas plasma SOD levels were lower in the AD (p < 0.001) and aMCI (p = 0.045) groups than in NC, and GSH-Px activity were higher in the AD group than in the aMCI group (p = 0.007). In addition, lipid metabolites and oxidative stress are widely associated. In conclusion, this study distinguished serum lipid metabolism in AD, aMCI, and NC subjects, highlighting that the three SPHs can distinguish AD and aMCI from NC. Additionally, AD patients showed elevated oxidative stress, and there are complex interactions between lipid metabolites and oxidative stress.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; biomarkers; lipid metabolism; oxidative stress,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Lipid Metabolism; Chromatography, Liquid; Neuropsychological Tests; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Cognitive Dysfunction; Oxidative Stress; Lipids; Superoxide Dismutase","Nie, Y; Chu, C; Qin, Q; Shen, H; Wen, L; Tang, Y; Qu, M"

Spinal cord and brain concentrations of riluzole after oral and intrathecal administration: A potential new treatment route for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Riluzole is the only treatment known to improve survival in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, oral riluzole efficacy is modest at best, further it is known to have large inter-individual variability of serum concentration and clearance, is formulated as an oral drug in a patient population plagued with dysphagia, and has known systemic side-effects like asthenia (limiting patient compliance) and elevated liver enzymes. In this context, we postulated that continuous intrathecal (IT) infusion of low doses of riluzole could provide consistent elevations of the drug spinal cord (SC) concentrations at or above those achieved with oral dosing, without increasing the risk for adverse events associated with systemic drug exposure or off-target side effects in the brain. We developed a formulation of riluzole for IT delivery and conducted our studies in purpose-bred hound dogs. Our non-GLP studies revealed that IT infusion alone was able to increase SC concentrations above those provided by oral administration, without increasing plasma concentrations. We then conducted two GLP studies that combined IT infusion with oral administration at human equivalent dose, to evaluate SC and brain concentrations of riluzole along with assessments of safety and tolerability. In the 6-week study, the highest IT dose (0.2 mg/hr) was well tolerated by the animals and increased SC concentrations above those achieved with oral riluzole alone, without increasing brain concentrations. In the 6-month study, the highest dose tested (0.4 mg/hr) was not tolerated and yielded SC significantly above those achieved in all previous studies. Our data show the feasibility and safety profile of continuous IT riluzole delivery to the spinal cord, without concurrent elevated liver enzymes, and minimal brain concentrations creating another potential therapeutic route of delivery to be used in isolation or in combination with other therapeutics.""",2023,,"Humans; Animals; Dogs; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Riluzole; Brain; Administration, Oral; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions","Keifer, OP; Gutierrez, J; Butt, MT; Cramer, SD; Bartus, R; Tansey, M; Deaver, D; Betourne, A; Boulis, NM"

"Aging to 24 months increased C57BL/6J mouse social sniffing and hippocampal Neto1 levels, and impaired female spatial learning.","Understanding how natural aging impacts rodent performance in translational behavior tests is critical to teasing apart impairments due to age-related decline from neurodegenerative disorder modeling. Reduced neuropilin and tolloid-like 1 (NETO1), an accessory protein of ionotropic glutamate receptors involved in synaptic plasticity, was associated with Alzheimer's disease, yet aging effects on Neto1 remain unclear. For these reasons, our goal was to characterize how Neto1 expression corresponded with social, repetitive, and spatial learning behaviors and stress response across the C57BL/6J mouse lifespan. We measured social preferences in three-chamber tests, and motor stereotypies by marble burying. Cognitive flexibility is typically assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM), wherein C57BL/6J mice exhibit deficits with age. However, fatigue or locomotor impairment may confound interpretation of MWM performance. Therefore, we used a less arduous water T-maze (WTM) to compare spatial learning flexibility in 2, 9-15, and 24-month-old male and female mice to test the hypothesis that deficits would emerge with age. In both sexes, 9-15-month-olds made more chamber entries during social preference tests, while 2-month-olds did less social sniffing than aged mice. No age or sex differences emerged in marble burying or serum corticosterone measurements. In 24-month-olds hippocampal Neto1was increased relative to 2-month-olds, and male cognitive flexibility was strong, while spatial learning and reversal learning of 24-month-old females was impaired in WTM irrespective of Neto1 expression. The WTM is a useful alternative assessment for cognitive flexibility deficits in aged mice, and the role of hippocampal Neto1 in promoting social sniffing is of interest.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive flexibility; NETO1; Social preference,,"Greene, SM; Klein, PR; Alcala, GA; Bustamante, I; Bordas, B; Johnson, A; Vu, V; Uhm, SY; Gould, GG"

Comparing the acute and chronic effects of metformin and antioxidant protective effects of N-acetyl cysteine on memory retrieval and oxidative stress in rats with Alzheimer's disease.,"It has been suggested that oxidative stress plays an important role in neural degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. Some studies have shown that metformin has some beneficial effects on the brain and reduces oxidative stress, while others reveal that metformin increases oxidative stress in diabetic patients. In this study acute and chronic effects of metformin and antioxidant protective effects of N-acetyl cysteine in Alzheimeric rats were investigated. Animals were divided into seven groups (n=8): Control, STZ, STZ + metformin (one, three and eleven weeks), STZ+ metformin (eleven weeks) +N-acetyl cysteine (eleven weeks) and N-acetyl cysteine (eleven weeks). ICV injections of saline (1μl/rat) or STZ (3mg/kg) and IP injections of Saline (1ml/kg), metformin (200mg/kg) and/or N-acetyl cysteine (100mg/kg) were done. Memory retrieval, CA1 neurons density and serums oxidative stress were investigated. STZ injections reduced memory retention, intact neurons and increased serum oxidative stress compared to the control (p<0/001). Metformin injection for one and three weeks (but not eleven weeks) improved the effects of STZ (p<0/001). Administration of N-acetylcysteine with metformin (eleven weeks) improved STZ bad effects (p<0/001).

"Triangulating brain alterations in anorexia nervosa: a multimodal investigation of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, morphometry and blood-based biomarkers.","The acute state of anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with widespread reductions in cortical gray matter (GM) thickness and white matter (WM) volume, suspected changes in myelin content and elevated levels of the neuronal damage marker neurofilament light (NF-L), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. To gain a deeper understanding of brain changes in AN, we applied a multimodal approach combining advanced neuroimaging methods with analysis of blood-derived biomarkers. In addition to standard measures of cortical GM thickness and WM volume, we analyzed tissue-specific profiles of brain metabolites using multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, T1 relaxation time as a proxy of myelin content leveraging advanced quantitative MRI methods and serum NF-L concentrations in a sample of 30 female, predominately adolescent patients with AN and 30 age-matched female healthy control participants. In patients with AN, we found a reduction in GM cortical thickness and GM total N-acetyl aspartate. The latter predicted higher NF-L levels, which were elevated in AN. Furthermore, GM total choline was elevated. In WM, there were no group differences in either imaging markers, choline levels or N-acetyl aspartate levels. The current study provides evidence for neuronal damage processes as well as for increased membrane lipid catabolism and turnover in GM in acute AN but no evidence for WM pathology.

One potential reason is not excluding the EEG aperiodic components, which are less associated with cognition than the periodic components.

Inflammation and the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease are associated with low circulating choline levels.,"Deficiency of dietary choline, an essential nutrient, is observed worldwide, with ~ 90% of Americans being deficient. Previous work highlights a relationship between decreased choline intake and an increased risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The associations between blood circulating choline and the pathological progression in both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD remain unknown. Here, we examined these associations in a cohort of patients with MCI with presence of either sparse or high neuritic plaque density and Braak stage and a second cohort with either moderate AD (moderate to frequent neuritic plaques, Braak stage = IV) or severe AD (frequent neuritic plaques, Braak stage = VI), compared to age-matched controls. Metabolomic analysis was performed on serum from the AD cohort. We then assessed the effects of dietary choline deficiency (Ch-) in 3xTg-AD mice and choline supplementation (Ch+) in APP/PS1 mice, two rodent models of AD. The levels of circulating choline were reduced while pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα was elevated in serum of both MCI sparse and high pathology cases. Reduced choline and elevated TNFα correlated with higher neuritic plaque density and Braak stage. In AD patients, we found reductions in choline, its derivative acetylcholine (ACh), and elevated TNFα. Choline and ACh levels were negatively correlated with neuritic plaque load, Braak stage, and TNFα, but positively correlated with MMSE, and brain weight. Metabolites L-Valine, 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic, Methylmalonic, and Ferulic acids were significantly associated with circuiting choline levels. In 3xTg-AD mice, the Ch- diet increased amyloid-β levels and tau phosphorylation in cortical tissue, and TNFα in both blood and cortical tissue, paralleling the severe human-AD profile. Conversely, the Ch+ diet increased choline and ACh while reducing amyloid-β and TNFα levels in brains of APP/PS1 mice. Collectively, low circulating choline is associated with AD-neuropathological progression, illustrating the importance of adequate dietary choline intake to offset disease.",2023,Acetylcholine; Choline; Human serum; Metabolomics; Mouse models; TNFα,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Choline; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Plaque, Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Acetylcholine; Inflammation; tau Proteins","Judd, JM; Jasbi, P; Winslow, W; Serrano, GE; Beach, TG; Klein-Seetharaman, J; Velazquez, R"

This study recruited 50 AD patients who were divided into two groups, one receiving donepezil (DON) treatment and the other receiving DON + HLJD treatment for 3 months. The curative effect, inflammatory and oxidative stress levels were analyzed. The PES-D/11, MMSE, and ADL scales were used to evaluate traditional Chinese medicine syndrome elements, cognitive function, mental state, and life ability. There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics and vital sign indicators. After drug treatment, the results showed that AD patients with HLJD combined with DON treatment didn't increase the adverse effects and had good compliance. HLJD combined with DON could improve the disease syndrome, making the differences in PES-D/11, MMSE, and ADL scores before and after the intervention larger. Furthermore, both DON and DON+HLJD treatment inhibited the levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MDA, raised SOD level, and HLJD enhances the inhibitory effect of DON on inflammation and oxidative stress. IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MDA levels were significantly correlated with curative effect. Moreover, this study found 107 (206) up-regulated metabolites and 1430 (145) down-regulated metabolites in urine (serum) and conducted differential metabolite screening and correlation analysis suggesting that HLJD may interfere with oxidative stress and inflammation in AD by regulating lipid metabolism and glutamic acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid, diaminopimelic acid, and 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid may play an important role in HLJD to improve AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Huanglian Jiedu Decoction; Inflammation; Metabolomics; Oxidative stress,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Donepezil; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Interleukin-6; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Metabolomics; Inflammation","Xu, M; Yue, Y; Huang, J"
Administration of recombinant FOXN1 protein attenuates Alzheimer's pathology in mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults and characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive functions that are associated with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Immune cells play an important role in the clearance of Aβ deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. T cells are the major component of the immune system. The thymus is the primary organ for T cell generation. T cell development in the thymus depends on thymic epithelial cells (TECs). However, TECs undergo both qualitative and quantitative loss over time. We have previously reported that a recombinant (r) protein containing FOXN1 and a protein transduction domain can increase the number of TECs and subsequently increases the number of T cells in mice. In this study we determined the ability of rFOXN1 to affect cognitive performance and AD pathology in mice.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid-beta; FOXN1; T cells; Thymic epithelial cells; Thymus,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Transgenic; Plaque, Amyloid; Humans","Zhao, J; Zhang, Z; Lai, KC; Lai, L"
The potential of blood neurofilament light as a marker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease.,"Over the past several years, there has been a surge in blood biomarker studies examining the value of plasma or serum neurofilament light (NfL) as a biomarker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease. However, there have been limited efforts to combine existing findings to assess the utility of blood NfL as a biomarker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we still need better insight into the specific aspects of neurodegeneration that are reflected by the elevated plasma or serum concentration of NfL. In this review, we survey the literature on the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between blood-based NfL levels and other, neuroimaging-based, indices of neurodegeneration in individuals on the Alzheimer's continuum. Then, based on the biomarker classification established by the FDA-NIH Biomarker Working group, we determine the utility of blood-based NfL as a marker for monitoring the disease status (i.e. monitoring biomarker) and predicting the severity of neurodegeneration in older adults with and without cognitive decline (i.e. a prognostic or a risk/susceptibility biomarker). The current findings suggest that blood NfL exhibits great promise as a monitoring biomarker because an increased NfL level in plasma or serum appears to reflect the current severity of atrophy, hypometabolism and the decline of white matter integrity, particularly in the brain regions typically affected by Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal evidence indicates that blood NfL can be useful not only as a prognostic biomarker for predicting the progression of neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease but also as a susceptibility/risk biomarker predicting the likelihood of abnormal alterations in brain structure and function in cognitively unimpaired individuals with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (e.g. those with a higher amyloid-β). There are still limitations to current research, as discussed in this review. Nevertheless, the extant literature strongly suggests that blood NfL can serve as a valuable prognostic and susceptibility biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration in clinical settings, as well as in research settings.",2024,atrophy; dementia; glucose metabolism; white matter microstructure,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofilament Proteins; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Jung, Y; Damoiseaux, JS"
"25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and risk of incident dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and delirium in 443,427 UK Biobank participants.","This study aimed to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and delirium. Participants from the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank with complete information on serum 25(OH)D concentrations were enrolled. Dementia, MCI and delirium were defined using the UK Biobank algorithm. 443,427 participants with a mean (standard deviation) age of 56.8 (8.0) years were included in this study. Based on Cox regression models, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with the risk of dementia, MCI, and delirium in a dose-dependent manner after adjusting for demographics (P-trend <0.001). In comparison with 25(OH)D levels less than 32.4 nmol/L, participants with the highest 25(OH)D levels (i.e., >64.4 nmol/L) had the lowest risk of dementia (hazards ratio [HR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.69, P<0.001), MCI (HR: 0.55, 95% CI 0.37-0.84, P=0.005), and delirium (HR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.79, P<0.001). These results were consistent with the sensitivity analysis, in which participants with events occurring within the first two years of follow-up were excluded. This study found that a lower serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of dementia (including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia), MCI, and delirium.",2023,25-hydroxyvitamin D; Cognitive decline; Delirium; Dementia; Mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Middle Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Delirium,"Ma, JH; Huang, NH; Huang, T; Mu, DL"
Optimizing animal models of autoimmune encephalitis using active immunization.,"Encephalitis is a devastating neurologic disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Autoimmune causes are roughly as common as infectious ones. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis (NMDARE), characterized by serum and/or spinal fluid NMDAR antibodies, is the most common form of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). A translational rodent NMDARE model would allow for pathophysiologic studies of AE, leading to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of this debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder. The main objective of this work was to identify optimal active immunization conditions for NMDARE in mice.",2023,NMDA receptor encephalitis; active immunization; autoimmune encephalitis; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); mouse model,"Mice; Female; Animals; Emulsions; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Encephalitis; Antibodies; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Vaccination; Disease Models, Animal; Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System","Linnoila, J; Jalali Motlagh, N; Jachimiec, G; Lin, CJ; Küllenberg, E; Wojtkiewicz, G; Tanzi, R; Chen, JW"
Liquid Biopsy in Neurological Diseases.,"The most recent and non-invasive approach for studying early-stage biomarkers is liquid biopsy. This implies the extraction and analysis of non-solid biological tissues (serum, plasma, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid) without undergoing invasive procedures to determine disease prognosis. Liquid biopsy can be used for the screening of several components, such as extracellular vesicles, microRNAs, cell-free DNA, cell-free mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, transfer RNA, and circular DNA or RNA derived from body fluids. Its application includes early disease diagnosis, the surveillance of disease activity, and treatment response monitoring, with growing evidence for validating this methodology in cancer, liver disease, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This review will provide an overview of mentioned liquid biopsy components, which could serve as valuable biomarkers for the evaluation of complex neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, CNS tumours, and neuroinfectious diseases. Furthermore, this review highlights the future directions and potential limitations associated with liquid biopsy.",2023,cfDNA; liquid biopsy; microRNA; neurological diseases,Humans; Liquid Biopsy; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; MicroRNAs; Central Nervous System Neoplasms; Biomarkers,"Malhotra, S; Miras, MCM; Pappolla, A; Montalban, X; Comabella, M"
A New Optical Interferometric Biosensing System Enhanced with Nanoparticles for Alzheimer's Disease in Serum.,"In this scientific work, we demonstrate, for the first time, a new biosensing system and procedure to measure specifically the total Tau (T-Tau) protein in serum, one of the most relevant biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a progressive brain disorder that produces neuronal and cognitive dysfunction and affects a high percentage of people worldwide. For this reason, diagnosing AD at the earliest possible stage involves improving diagnostic systems. We report on the use of interferometric bio-transducers integrated with 65 microwells forming diagnostic KITs read-out by using the Interferometric Optical Detection Method (IODM).

Fibroblast growth factor 10 ameliorates neurodegeneration in mouse and cellular models of Alzheimer's disease via reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized with senile plaques formed by Aβ deposition, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which ultimately lead to cognitive impairment. Despite the heavy economic and life burdens faced by the patients with AD, effective treatments are still lacking. Previous studies have reported the neuroprotective effects of FGF10 in CNS diseases, but its role in AD remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that FGF10 levels were reduced in the serum of AD patients, as well as in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice and APPswe-transfected HT22 cells, suggesting a close relationship between FGF10 and AD. Further investigations revealed that intranasal delivery of FGF10 improved cognitive functions in 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, FGF10 treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis, thereby mitigating neuronal cell damage and synaptic deficits in the cortex and hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice, as well as APPswe-transfected HT22 cells. Furthermore, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of FGF10 gene delivery for treating AD symptoms and pathologies. Tail vein delivery of the FGF10 gene using AAV9 improved cognitive and neuronal functions in 3xTg-AD mice. Similarly, endogenous FGF10 overexpression ameliorated tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, we confirmed that the FGFR2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was activated following intranasal FGF10 delivery and AAV9-mediated FGF10 gene delivery in 3xTg-AD mice and APPswe-transfected HT22 cells. Knockdown of FGFR2 attenuated the protective effect of FGF10. Collectively, these findings suggest that intranasal delivery of FGF10 and AAV9-mediated FGF10 gene delivery could be a promising disease-modifying therapy for AD.",2023,FGFR2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; fibroblast growth factor 10; neuronal apoptosis; tau hyperphosphorylation,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Fibroblast Growth Factor 10; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Apoptosis; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Transgenic; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Guo, K; Huang, W; Chen, K; Huang, P; Peng, W; Shi, R; He, T; Zhang, M; Wang, H; Hu, J; Wang, X; Shentu, Y; Xu, H; Lin, L"

Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: a multicenter-based cross-sectional and longitudinal study in China.,"Discrepancies in diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) may arise from racial disparities, risk factors, or lifestyle differences. Moreover, there has been a lack of systematic and multicenter studies to evaluate baselines of the AD biomarkers in Chinese populations. Thus, there is an urgent need for research to investigate the effectiveness of blood biomarkers for AD, specifically in the Chinese Han population, using a multicenter approach. In the present multicenter-based cross-sectional and longitudinal study, we evaluated 817 blood samples from 6 different clinical centers. We measured plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)-40, Aβ42, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau), total tau (tTau), serum neurofilament light (NFL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).

Characterization of chemical constituents and metabolites in vivo and in vitro after oral administration of Wuteng tablets in rats by UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS.,"Waste medicinal plants are widely used in drug production. With the increasing demand for botanical drugs, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective drugs and improve the utilization of medicinal plant resources. Wuteng tablets (WTP) are extracted from the stem of Schisandra chinensis and have a good therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease. In this study, a holistic identification strategy based on UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS was developed for the first time to investigate the metabolites and metabolic pathways involved in the in vitro metabolism and liver microsomal incubation and in the in vivo metabolic system of rats after WTP administration. After the oral administration of WTP, 21 metabolites were identified in the serum and 25 metabolites were identified in the urine, of which six were new metabolites; 33 metabolites were inferred from the microsomal metabolites in vitro. The metabolic pathways related to WTP mainly involve demethylation, hydroxylation, dehydroxylation and dehydrogenation. In this study, the metabolites and metabolic pathways of WTP were elucidated via UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS, which provided a basis for an in-depth study of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacotoxicological effects of WTP.",2023,Schisandra chinensis; UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS; Wuteng tablet; metabolomics,"Rats; Animals; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Administration, Oral; Alzheimer Disease; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Drugs, Chinese Herbal","Chen, P; Pang, C; Xu, T; Dong, P; Han, H"

O-GlcNAcylation regulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Aberrant activation of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) signaling is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. For example, enhanced ERK signal activation mediated by Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), which is a critical genetic risk factor for AD, increases the transcription of amyloid precursor protein (APP). We hypothesize that O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) regulates the phosphorylation and activation of ERK. O-GlcNAc is a single sugar post-translational modification that dynamically cycles on and off proteins in response to nutrient changes by the action of the enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively.

Rare exonic variant affects GRN splicing and contributes to frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"Heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) by a mechanism of haploinsufficiency. For most missense mutations, the contribution to FTLD is however unclear. We studied the pathogenicity of rare GRN missense mutations using patient biomaterials. We identified a new mutation in GRN, c.1178 A>C, in a patient with a diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia. Neuropathological examination of autopsied brain showed FTLD with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP) type A pathology with concomitant Alzheimer's disease pathology. Serum progranulin protein levels were reduced to levels comparable to known LOF mutations. The mutation is in the last codon of exon 10, in the splice donor sequence. Our data provide evidence that the mutation leads to aberrant splicing, resulting in a frameshift (p.(Glu393AlafsTer31)) and consequently nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Our finding demonstrates that carefully examining sequencing data around splice sites is needed since this mutation was annotated as a missense mutation.

Post-Ischemic Permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier to Amyloid and Platelets as a Factor in the Maturation of Alzheimer's Disease-Type Brain Neurodegeneration.,"The aim of this review is to present evidence of the impact of ischemic changes in the blood-brain barrier on the maturation of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration with features of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the processes involved in the permeability of the post-ischemic blood-brain barrier during recirculation will provide clinically relevant knowledge regarding the neuropathological changes that ultimately lead to dementia of the Alzheimer's disease type. In this review, we try to distinguish between primary and secondary neuropathological processes during and after ischemia. Therefore, we can observe two hit stages that contribute to Alzheimer's disease development. The onset of ischemic brain pathology includes primary ischemic neuronal damage and death followed by the ischemic injury of the blood-brain barrier with serum leakage of amyloid into the brain tissue, leading to increased ischemic neuronal susceptibility to amyloid neurotoxicity, culminating in the formation of amyloid plaques and ending in full-blown dementia of the Alzheimer's disease type.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; amyloid plaques; astrocytes; blood–brain barrier; brain ischemia; microbleeding; neurodegeneration; neurofibrillary tangle; pericytes; platelets; tau protein,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Blood-Brain Barrier; Blood Platelets; Brain; Ischemia; Amyloid; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Pluta, R; Miziak, B; Czuczwar, SJ"
Central and Peripheral Inflammation in Mild Cognitive Impairment in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by an abnormal decline in mental and cognitive function compared with normal cognitive aging. It is an underlying condition of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. In recent years, neuroinflammation has been investigated as a new leading target that contributes to MCI progression into AD. Understanding the mechanism underlying inflammatory processes involved in the early onset of the disease could help find a safe and effective way to diagnose and treat patients. In this article, we assessed over twenty different blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory biomarker concentrations with immunoassay methods in patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment), non-impaired control (NIC), and serum healthy control (HC). We performed group comparisons and analyzed in-group correlations between the biomarkers. We included 107 participants (mean age: 64.7 ± 7.8, women: 58.9%).

Multisystem pathology in McLeod syndrome.,"We present a comprehensive characterization of clinical, neuropathological, and multisystem features of a man with genetically confirmed McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome, including video and autopsy findings. A 61-year-old man presented with a movement disorder and behavioral change. Examination showed dystonic choreiform movements in all four limbs, reduced deep-tendon reflexes, and wide-based gait. He had oromandibular dyskinesia causing severe dysphagia. Elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK) was first noted in his thirties, but investigations, including muscle biopsy at that time, were inconclusive. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed white matter volume loss, atrophic basal ganglia, and chronic small vessel ischemia. Despite raised CK, electromyography did not show myopathic changes. Exome gene panel testing was negative, but targeted genetic analysis revealed a hemizygous pathogenic variant in the XK gene c.895C > T p.(Gln299Ter), consistent with a diagnosis of McLeod syndrome. The patient died of sepsis, and autopsy showed astrocytic gliosis and atrophy of the basal ganglia, diffuse iron deposition in the putamen, and mild Alzheimer's pathology. Muscle pathology was indicative of mild chronic neurogenic atrophy without overt myopathic features. He had non-specific cardiomyopathy and splenomegaly. McLeod syndrome is an ultra-rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by X-linked recessive mutations in the XK gene. Diagnosis has management implications since patients are at risk of severe transfusion reactions and cardiac complications.

Peripherin is a biomarker of axonal damage in peripheral nervous system disease.,"Valid, responsive blood biomarkers specific to peripheral nerve damage would improve management of peripheral nervous system (PNS) diseases. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is sensitive for detecting axonal pathology but is not specific to PNS damage, as it is expressed throughout the PNS and CNS. Peripherin, another intermediate filament protein, is almost exclusively expressed in peripheral nerve axons. We postulated that peripherin would be a promising blood biomarker of PNS axonal damage. We demonstrated that peripherin is distributed in sciatic nerve, and to a lesser extent spinal cord tissue lysates, but not in brain or extra-neural tissues. In the spinal cord, anti-peripherin antibody bound only to the primary cells of the periphery (anterior horn cells, motor axons and primary afferent sensory axons). In vitro models of antibody-mediated axonal and demyelinating nerve injury showed marked elevation of peripherin levels only in axonal damage and only a minimal rise in demyelination. We developed an immunoassay using single molecule array technology for the detection of serum peripherin as a biomarker for PNS axonal damage. We examined longitudinal serum peripherin and NfL concentrations in individuals with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS, n = 45, 179 time points), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP, n = 35, 70 time points), multiple sclerosis (n = 30), dementia (as non-inflammatory CNS controls, n = 30) and healthy individuals (n = 24). Peak peripherin levels were higher in GBS than all other groups (median 18.75 pg/ml versus < 6.98 pg/ml, P < 0.0001). Peak NfL was highest in GBS (median 220.8 pg/ml) and lowest in healthy controls (median 5.6 pg/ml), but NfL did not distinguish between CIDP (17.3 pg/ml), multiple sclerosis (21.5 pg/ml) and dementia (29.9 pg/ml). While peak NfL levels were higher with older age (rho = +0.39, P < 0.0001), peak peripherin levels did not vary with age. In GBS, local regression analysis of serial peripherin in the majority of individuals with three or more time points of data (16/25) displayed a rise-and-fall pattern with the highest value within the first week of initial assessment. Similar analysis of serial NfL concentrations showed a later peak at 16 days. Group analysis of serum peripherin and NfL levels in GBS and CIDP patients were not significantly associated with clinical data, but in some individuals with GBS, peripherin levels appeared to better reflect clinical outcome measure improvement. Serum peripherin is a promising new, dynamic and specific biomarker of acute PNS axonal damage.",2023,axon; biomarker; guillain-Barré syndrome; neuropathy; peripheral nervous system; peripherin,"Humans; Peripherins; Intermediate Filaments; Polyradiculoneuropathy, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Axons; Biomarkers; Dementia; Multiple Sclerosis","Keddie, S; Smyth, D; Keh, RYS; Chou, MKL; Grant, D; Surana, S; Heslegrave, A; Zetterberg, H; Wieske, L; Michael, M; Eftimov, F; Bellanti, R; Rinaldi, S; Hart, MS; Petzold, A; Lunn, MP"

"Unbiased proteomics and multivariable regularized regression techniques identify SMOC1, NOG, APCS, and NTN1 in an Alzheimer's disease brain proteomic signature.","Advancements in omics methodologies have generated a wealth of high-dimensional Alzheimer's disease (AD) datasets, creating significant opportunities and challenges for data interpretation. In this study, we utilized multivariable regularized regression techniques to identify a reduced set of proteins that could discriminate between AD and cognitively normal (CN) brain samples. Utilizing eNetXplorer, an R package that tests the accuracy and significance of a family of elastic net generalized linear models, we identified 4 proteins (SMOC1, NOG, APCS, NTN1) that accurately discriminated between AD (n = 31) and CN (n = 22) middle frontal gyrus (MFG) tissue samples from Religious Orders Study participants with 83 percent accuracy. We then validated this signature in MFG samples from Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants using leave-one-out logistic regression cross-validation, finding that the signature again accurately discriminated AD (n = 31) and CN (n = 19) participants with a receiver operating characteristic curve area under the curve of 0.863. These proteins were strongly correlated with the burden of neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid pathology in both study cohorts. We additionally tested whether these proteins differed between AD and CN inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) samples and blood serum samples at the time of AD diagnosis in ROS and BLSA, finding that the proteins differed between AD and CN ITG samples but not in blood serum samples. The identified proteins may provide mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of AD, and the methods utilized in this study may serve as the basis for further work with additional high-dimensional datasets in AD.",2023,,,"Roberts, JA; Varma, VR; Candia, J; Tanaka, T; Ferrucci, L; Bennett, DA; Thambisetty, M"

HLA-A23/HLA-A24 serotypes and dementia interaction in the elderly: Association with increased soluble HLA class I molecules in plasma.,"MHC class I molecules regulate brain development and plasticity in mice and HLA class I molecules are associated with brain disorders in humans. We investigated the relationship between plasma-derived soluble human HLA class I molecules (sHLA class I), HLA class I serotypes and dementia. A cohort of HLA class I serotyped elderly subjects with no dementia/pre-dementia (NpD, n = 28), or with dementia (D, n = 28) was studied. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the influence of dementia and HLA class I serotype on sHLA class I levels, and to compare sHLA class I within four groups according to the presence or absence of HLA-A23/A24 and dementia. HLA-A23/A24 and dementia, but not age, significantly influenced the level of sHLA class I. Importantly, the concurrent presence of HLA-A23/A24 and dementia was associated with higher levels of sHLA class I (p < 0.001). This study has shown that the simultaneous presence of HLA-A23/HLA-A24 and dementia is associated with high levels of serum sHLA class I molecules.

A highly sensitive hemicyanine-based near-infrared fluorescence sensor for detecting toxic amyloid aggregates in human serum.,"The development of an accurate and sensitive sensor for detecting amyloid plaques, which are responsible for many protein disorders like Alzheimer's disease, is crucial for early diagnosis. Recently, there has been a notable increase in the development of fluorescence probes that exhibit emission in the red region (>600 nm), aiming to effectively tackle the challenges encountered when working with complex biological matrices. In the current investigation, a hemicyanine-based probe, called LDS730, has been used for the sensing of amyloid fibrils, which belong to the Near-Infrared Fluorescence (NIRF) family of dyes. NIRF probes provide higher precision in detection, prevent photo-damage, and minimize the autofluorescence of biological specimens. The LDS730 sensor emits in the near-infrared region and shows a 110-fold increase in fluorescence turn-on emission when bound to insulin fibrils, making it a highly sensitive sensor. The sensor has an emission maximum of ~710 nm in a fibril-bound state, which shows a significant red shift along with a Stokes' shift of ~50 nm. The LDS730 sensor also displays excellent performance in the complicated human serum matrix, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 103 nM. Molecular docking calculations suggest that the most likely binding location of LDS730 in the fibrillar structure is the inner channels of amyloid fibrils along its long axis, and the sensor engages in several types of hydrophobic interactions with neighboring amino acid residues of the fibrillar structure. Overall, this new amyloid sensor has great potential for the early detection of amyloid plaques and for improving diagnostic accuracy.",2023,Amyloid aggregates; Hemicyanine-based probe; Near-infrared fluorescence; Time-resolved fluorescence; Turn-on fluorescence probe,"Humans; Amyloid; Plaque, Amyloid; Molecular Docking Simulation; Fluorescent Dyes; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Warerkar, OD; Mudliar, NH; Ahuja, T; Shahane, SD; Singh, PK"
PCA-WRKNN-assisted label-free SERS serum analysis platform enabling non-invasive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder with significant economic and societal impacts, whereas early AD diagnosis remains a considerable challenge. Here, a robust and convenient surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) analysis platform was fabricated on a microarray chip to dissect the variation in serum composition for AD diagnosis, eliminating the invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based and costly instrument-dependent diagnostic methods. AuNOs array prepared by self-assembly at liquid-liquid interface enabled the acquirement of SERS spectra with excellent reproducibility. Moreover, a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation suggested the significant plasmon hybridization generated by AuNOs aggregation, resulting in high signal-to-noise ratio SERS spectra. We established an AD mice model with Aβ1-40 induction followed by recording the serum SERS spectra at different stages. A multivariate analysis method of principal component analysis (PCA)-weighted representation-based k-nearest neighbor (WRKNN) was applied for the characteristics extraction to improve the classification performance, with an accuracy of over 95 %, an AUC of over 90 %, a sensitivity of over 80 %, and a specificity of over 96.7 %. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of SERS application as a diagnostic screening method, following further validation and optimization, which may open up new exciting opportunities for future biomedical applications.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; K-nearest neighbor; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Multivariate Analysis; Cluster Analysis; Spectrum Analysis, Raman","Li, W; Chen, G; Chen, M; Shen, K; Wu, C; Shen, W; Zhang, F"

PETCH-DB: a Portal for Exploring Tissue-specific and Complex disease-associated 5-Hydroxymethylcytosines.,"Epigenetic modifications play critical roles in gene regulation and disease pathobiology. Highly sensitive enabling technologies, including microarray- and sequencing-based approaches have allowed genome-wide profiling of cytosine modifications in DNAs in clinical samples to facilitate discovery of epigenetic biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Historically, many previous studies, however, did not distinguish the most investigated 5-methylcytosines (5mC) from other modified cytosines, especially the biochemically stable 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), which have been shown to have a distinct genomic distribution and regulatory role from 5mC. Notably, during the past several years, the 5hmC-Seal, a highly sensitive chemical labeling technique, has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in clinically feasible biospecimens (e.g. a few milliliter of plasma or serum). The 5hmC-Seal technique has been utilized by our team in biomarker discovery for human cancers and other complex diseases using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), as well as the characterization of the first 5hmC Human Tissue Map. Convenient access to the accumulating 5hmC-Seal data will allow the research community to validate and re-use these results, potentially providing novel insights into epigenetic contribution to a range of human diseases. Here we introduce the PETCH-DB, an integrated database that was implemented to provide 5hmC-related results generated using the 5hmC-Seal technique. We aim the PETCH-DB to be a central portal, which will be available to the scientific community with regularly updated 5hmC data in clinical samples to reflect current advances in this field.

Discerning the Prospects of miRNAs as a Multi-Target Therapeutic and Diagnostic for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Although over the last few decades, numerous attempts have been made to halt Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and mitigate its symptoms, only a few have been proven beneficial. Most medications available, still only cater to the symptoms of the disease rather than fixing the cause at the root level. A novel approach involving the use of miRNAs, which work on the principle of gene silencing, is being explored by scientists. Naturally present miRNAs in the biological system help to regulate various genes than may be implicated in AD-like BACE-1 and APP. One miRNA thus, holds the power to keep a check on several genes, conferring it the ability to be used as a multi-target therapeutic. With aging and the onset of diseased pathology, dysregulation of these miRNAs is observed. This flawed miRNA expression is responsible for the unusual buildup of amyloid proteins, fibrillation of tau proteins in the brain, neuronal death and other hallmarks leading to AD. The use of miRNA mimics and miRNA inhibitors provides an attractive perspective for fixing the upregulation and downregulation of miRNAs that led to abnormal cellular activities. Furthermore, the detection of miRNAs in the CSF and serum of diseased patients might be considered an earlier biomarker for the disease. While most of the therapies designed around AD have not succeeded completely, the targeting of dysregulated miRNAs in AD patients might give a new direction to scholars to develop an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; RNA interference; miRNA; miRNA inhibitors; miRNA mimics; siRNA,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; MicroRNAs; tau Proteins; Brain; Up-Regulation,"Bhatnagar, D; Ladhe, S; Kumar, D"

Dual mode of Triphala in the reversal of cognition through gut restoration in antibiotic mediated prolonged dysbiosis condition in 5XFAD mice.,"The emerging role of gut-brain axis decoding recently created a new hope for investigating the biological and physiological basis of neurodegenerative disorders and other neurological problems. In this context, we used the bidirectional polyphenols-rich Triphala against the antibiotics cocktail-treated 5XFAD mice to decode the gut-brain axis. After 60 days of orally given Triphala and Antibiotics, the treated group showed significant improvement in the cognitive parameters in the behavioral study Morris water and Y maze. The Triphala treated group showed the neurogenesis, reduced level of amyloid beta in serum, and amyloid precursor protein, mRNA expression in the brain of mice.

Meloxicam Targets COX-2/NOX1/NOX4/Nrf2 Axis to Ameliorate the Depression-like Neuropathology Induced by Chronic Restraint Stress in Rats.,"Meloxicam has shown significant neuroprotection in experimental models of stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. However, the potential of meloxicam to treat depression-like neuropathology in a chronic restraint stress (CRS) model and the associated molecular changes has been insufficiently explored. The current work aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective actions of meloxicam against CRS-evoked depression in rats. In the current experiments, animals received meloxicam (10 mg/kg/day; i.p.) for 21 days, and CRS was instigated by restraining the animals for 6 h/day during the same period. The sucrose preference test and the forced swimming test were used to explore the depression-linked anhedonia/despair, whereas the open-field test examined the animals' locomotor activity. The current findings revealed that CRS elicited typical depression behavioral anomalies in the animals, including anhedonia, despair, and diminished locomotor activity; these findings were reinforced with Z-normalization scores. These observations were corroborated by brain histopathological changes and increased damage scores. In CRS-exposed animals, serum corticosterone spiked, and the hippocampi revealed decreased monoamine neurotransmitter levels (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine). Mechanistically, neuroinflammation was evident in stressed animals, as shown by elevated hippocampal TNF-α and IL-1β cytokines.

"SERUM LIPOCALIN-2, AND FETUIN-A LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.","Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease leading to a progressive and irreversible loss of mental functions. It is characterized by 3 stages according to the evolution and the severity of the symptoms. The authors of the present study aimed to investigate the levels of serum lipocalin-2, fetuin-A, and TNF-α in patients with Alzheimer's disease. 56 patients with Alzheimer's disease (the first group), and another 25 healthy volunteers (control group) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The serum levels of lipocalin-2, fetuin-A, and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) were determined with the use of the ELISA method. There was a significant elevation in serum lipocalin-2, and TNF-α levels in the AD group (88.68±32.1) and(42.28±5.05) respectively, compared to the control group (63±28.5), and (35.19±5.07) respectively, [p<0.001].

Galectin-3 activates spinal microglia to induce inflammatory nociception in wild type but not in mice modelling Alzheimer's disease.,"Musculoskeletal chronic pain is prevalent in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it remains largely untreated in these patients, raising the possibility that pain mechanisms are perturbed. Here, we utilise the TASTPM transgenic mouse model of AD with the K/BxN serum transfer model of inflammatory arthritis. We show that in male and female WT mice, inflammatory allodynia is associated with a distinct spinal cord microglial response characterised by TLR4-driven transcriptional profile and upregulation of P2Y12. Dorsal horn nociceptive afferent terminals release the TLR4 ligand galectin-3 (Gal-3), and intrathecal injection of a Gal-3 inhibitor attenuates allodynia. In contrast, TASTPM mice show reduced inflammatory allodynia, which is not affected by the Gal-3 inhibitor and correlates with the emergence of a P2Y12",2023,,"Mice; Male; Female; Animals; Hyperalgesia; Microglia; Alzheimer Disease; Galectin 3; Nociception; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn; Mice, Transgenic; Chronic Pain; Disease Models, Animal","Sideris-Lampretsas, G; Oggero, S; Zeboudj, L; Silva, R; Bajpai, A; Dharmalingam, G; Collier, DA; Malcangio, M"

Tetrahydroxy stilbene glycoside ameliorates neuroinflammation for Alzheimer's disease via cGAS-STING.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known as senile dementia, is the most common degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation is currently believed to be a crucial factor in the progression of AD, while its exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that AD transgenic mice exhibited cognitive deficits accompanied by the elevated serum and brain inflammation. Treating with a natural active ingredient tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) from the Chinese herb Polygonum multiflorum that has been well known for its unique anti-aging effect, learning-memory ability of AD mice was distinctly improved. Meanwhile, it was observed that the expressions of serum inflammatory cytokines and the activation of microglia in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were suppressed after TSG treatment, which was probably attributable to the decrease of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) triggered immune response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, cell culture experiments employing LPS combined with IFN-γ induced microglia activation showed that TSG reversed the polarization status of M1-type microglia to restore the quiescence, and cGAS-STING elevation was observed in the activated microglia and normalized by TSG incubation. In addition, TSG suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-α and IFN-β, as well as the expression of IFN regulatory proteins such as IFIT1 and IRF7 in the LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated inflammatory response in BV2 cell. Finally, it was also verified that TSG are, in part, through a cGAS-STING dependent pathway and triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation to inhibit neuroinflammation through interfering with cGAS-STING inhibitors. Taken together, our findings highlight the health benefits of TSG and its potential application in preventing cognitive disorders by inhibiting neuroinflammation through cGAS-STING signaling pathway in AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; NLRP3 inflammasome; Neuroinflammation; Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside; cGAS-STING pathway,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Inflammasomes; Glycosides; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Lipopolysaccharides; Cytokines; Nucleotidyltransferases; Mice, Transgenic; Stilbenes","Gao, D; Hao, JP; Li, BY; Zheng, CC; Miao, BB; Zhang, L; Li, YL; Li, L; Li, XJ; Zhang, L"

Increased Cerebral Serum Amyloid A2 and Parameters of Oxidation in Arylsulfatase B (N-Acetylgalactosamine-4-Sulfatase)-Null Mice.,"Chondroitin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the impact of modified chondroitin sulfates is being investigated in several animal and cell-based models of AD. Published reports have shown the role of accumulation of chondroitin 4-sulfate and decline in Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; B-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase) in other pathology, including nerve injury, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. However, the impact of ARSB deficiency on AD pathobiology has not been reported, although changes in ARSB were associated with AD in two prior reports. The enzyme ARSB removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate and is required for their degradation.

Exploring the potential of a novel phenoxyethyl piperidine derivative with cholinesterase inhibitory properties as a treatment for dementia: Insights from STZ animal model of dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, often characterized by progressive deficits in memory and cognitive functions. Cholinesterase inhibitors have been introduced as promising agents to enhance cognition and memory in both human patients and animal models of AD. In the current study, we assessed the effects of a synthetic phenoxyethyl piperidine derivative, compound 7c, as a novel dual inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), on learning and memory, as well as serum and hippocampal AChE levels in an animal model of AD. The model of dementia was induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 2 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats. STZ-treated rats received compound 7c (3, 30, and 300 µg/kg) for five consecutive days. ​Passive avoidance (PA) learning and memory, as well as spatial learning and memory using Morris water maze, were evaluated. The level of AChE was measured in the serum and the left and right hippocampus. Findings demonstrated that compound 7c (300 µg/kg) was able to reverse STZ-induced impairments in PA memory, while also reduced the increased AChE level in the left hippocampus. Taken together, compound 7c appeared to act as a central AChE inhibitor, and its role in alleviating cognitive deficits in the AD animal model suggests that it may have therapeutic potential in AD dementia. Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of compound 7c in more reliable models of AD in light of these preliminary findings.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Cholinesterase inhibitor; Compound 7c; Phenoxyethyl piperidine derivative,"Rats; Humans; Male; Animals; Streptozocin; Butyrylcholinesterase; Acetylcholinesterase; Rats, Wistar; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Memory Disorders; Maze Learning; Alzheimer Disease; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Piperidines; Disease Models, Animal","Abolhasani, F; Pourshojaei, Y; Mohammadi, F; Esmaeilpour, K; Asadipour, A; Ilaghi, M; Shabani, M"
SpotLight Proteomics Identifies Variable Sequences of Blood Antibodies Specific Against Deamidated Human Serum Albumin.,"Spontaneous deamidation of asparaginyl residues in proteins, if not repaired or cleared, can set in motion a cascade that leads to deteriorated health. Previously, we have discovered that deamidated human serum albumin (HSA) is elevated in the blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, while the level of endogenous antibodies against deamidated HSA is significantly diminished, creating an imbalance between the risk factor and the defense against it. Endogenous antibodies against deamidated proteins are still unexplored. In the current study, we employed the SpotLight proteomics approach to identify novel amino acid sequences in antibodies specific to deamidated HSA.

Lipidomic markers for the prediction of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.,"Dementia is a well-known syndrome and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia. Lipids play a key role in the pathogenesis of AD, however, the prediction value of serum lipidomics on AD remains unclear. This study aims to construct a lipid score system to predict the risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. First, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model to select the lipids that can signify the progression from MCI to AD based on 310 older adults with MCI. Then we constructed a lipid score based on 14 single lipids using Cox regression and estimated the association between the lipid score and progression from MCI to AD. The prevalence of AD in the low-, intermediate- and high-score groups was 42.3%, 59.8%, and 79.8%, respectively. The participants in the intermediate- and high-score group had a 1.65-fold (95% CI 1.10 to 2.47) and 3.55-fold (95% CI 2.40 to 5.26) higher risk of AD, respectively, as compared to those with low lipid scores. The lipid score showed moderate prediction efficacy (c-statistics > 0.72).

Substrate-dependent inactivation of recombinant paraoxonase 1 during catalytic dihydrocoumarin turnover and the protective properties of surfactants.,"Human paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is the most studied member of the paraoxonases (PONs) family and catalyzes the hydrolysis of various substrates (lactones, aryl esters, and paraoxon). Numerous studies link PON1 to oxidative stress-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV infection, autism, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, where the kinetic behavior of an enzyme is characterized by initial rates or by modern methods that obtain enzyme kinetic parameters by fitting the computed curves over the entire time-courses of product formation (progress curves). In the analysis of progress curves, the behavior of PON1 during hydrolytically catalyzed turnover cycles is unknown. Hence, progress curves for enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactone substrate dihydrocoumarin (DHC) by recombinant PON1 (rePON1) were analyzed to investigate the effect of catalytic DHC turnover on the stability of rePON1. Although rePON1 was significantly inactivated during the catalytic DHC turnover, its activity was not lost due to the product inhibition or spontaneous inactivation of rePON1 in the sample buffers. Examination of the progress curves of DHC hydrolysis by rePON1 led to the conclusion that rePON1 inactivates itself during catalytic DHC turnover hydrolysis. Moreover, human serum albumin or surfactants protected rePON1 from inactivation during this catalytic process, which is significant because the activity of PON1 in clinical samples is measured in the presence of albumin.",2023,Catalytic turnover; Enzyme stabilization by surfactants; Paraoxonase; Progress curve analysis; Substrate-dependent enzyme inactivation,Humans; Aryldialkylphosphatase; Surface-Active Agents; HIV Infections; Hydrolysis; Catalysis,"Smerkolj, J; Stojan, J; Bavec, A; Goličnik, M"

VEGF-A in serum protects against memory impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by blocking neutrophil infiltration.,"Activation of innate immunity in the brain is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study investigated the regulation of innate immunity by wild-type serum injection in a transgenic AD mouse model. We found that treatment with wild-type mouse serum significantly reduced the number of neutrophils and microglial reactivity in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Mimicking this effect, neutrophil depletion via Ly6G neutralizing antibodies resulted in improvements in AD brain functions. Serum proteomic analysis identified vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) as factors enriched in serum samples, which are crucial for neutrophil migration and chemotaxis, leukocyte migration, and cell chemotaxis. Exogenous VEGF-A reversed amyloid β (Aβ)-induced decreases in cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and increases in CXCL1 in vitro and blocked neutrophil infiltration into the AD brain. Endothelial Cdk5 overexpression conferred an inhibitory effect on CXCL1 and neutrophil infiltration, thereby restoring memory abilities in APP/PS1 mice.

Higher immune-related gene expression in major depression is independent of CRP levels: results from the BIODEP study.,"Compelling evidence demonstrates that some individuals suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit increased levels of inflammation. Most studies focus on inflammation-related proteins, such as serum or plasma C-reactive protein (CRP). However, the immune-related modifications associated with MDD may be not entirely captured by CRP alone. Analysing mRNA gene expression levels, we aimed to identify broader molecular immune-related phenotypes of MDD. We examined 168 individuals from the non-interventional, case-control, BIODEP study, 128 with a diagnosis of MDD and 40 healthy controls. Individuals with MDD were further divided according to serum high-sensitivity (hs)CRP levels (n = 59 with CRP <1, n = 33 with CRP 1-3 and n = 36 with CRP >3 mg/L). We isolated RNA from whole blood and performed gene expression analyses using RT-qPCR. We measured the expression of 16 immune-related candidate genes: A2M, AQP4, CCL2, CXCL12, CRP, FKBP5, IL-1-beta, IL-6, ISG15, MIF, GR, P2RX7, SGK1, STAT1, TNF-alpha and USP18. Nine of the 16 candidate genes were differentially expressed in MDD cases vs. controls, with no differences between CRP-based groups. Only CRP mRNA was clearly associated with serum CRP. In contrast, plasma (proteins) IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-16, IL-17A, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, and neutrophils counts, were all differentially regulated between CRP-based groups (higher in CRP >3 vs. CRP <1 and/or controls), reflecting the gradient of CRP values. Secondary analyses on MDD individuals and controls with CRP values <1 mg/L (usually interpreted as 'no inflammation') confirmed MDD cases still had significantly different mRNA expression of immune-related genes compared with controls. These findings corroborate an immune-related molecular activation in MDD, which appears to be independent of serum CRP levels. Additional biological mechanisms may then be required to translate this mRNA signature into inflammation at protein and cellular levels. Understanding these mechanisms will help to uncover the true immune abnormalities in depression, opening new paths for diagnosis and treatment.",2023,,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Depression; Interleukin-6; C-Reactive Protein; Inflammation; RNA, Messenger; Gene Expression; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","Sforzini, L; Cattaneo, A; Ferrari, C; Turner, L; Mariani, N; Enache, D; Hastings, C; Lombardo, G; Nettis, MA; Nikkheslat, N; Worrell, C; Zajkowska, Z; Kose, M; Cattane, N; Lopizzo, N; Mazzelli, M; Pointon, L; Cowen, PJ; Cavanagh, J; Harrison, NA; Jones, D; Drevets, WC; Mondelli, V; Bullmore, ET; Pariante, CM"
A novel anti-apoptotic role for Cdc42/ACK-1 signaling in neurons.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are caused by a progressive and aberrant destruction of neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These disorders lack effective long-term treatments that impact the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis and as a result, existing options focus primarily on alleviating symptomology. Dysregulated programmed cell death (i.e., apoptosis) is a significant contributor to neurodegeneration, and is controlled by a number of different factors. Rho family GTPases are molecular switches with recognized importance in proper neuronal development and migration that have more recently emerged as central regulators of apoptosis and neuronal survival. Here, we investigated a role for the Rho GTPase family member, Cdc42, and its downstream effectors, in neuronal survival and apoptosis. We initially induced apoptosis in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) by removing both growth factor-containing serum and depolarizing potassium from the cell medium. We then utilized both chemical inhibitors and adenoviral shRNA targeted to Cdc42 to block the function of Cdc42 or its downstream effectors under either control or apoptotic conditions. Our in vitro studies demonstrate that functional inhibition of Cdc42 or its downstream effector, activated Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase-1 (ACK-1), had no adverse effects on CGN survival under control conditions, but significantly sensitized neurons to cell death under apoptotic conditions. In conclusion, our results suggest a key pro-survival role for Cdc42/ACK-1 signaling in neurons, particularly in regulating neuronal susceptibility to pro-apoptotic stress such as that observed in neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,ACK-1; Cdc42; Neuronal apoptosis; Neuronal survival; Rho GTPase,Rats; Animals; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; Neurons; Apoptosis,"Punessen, NC; Pena, C; Sandberg, A; Koza, LA; Linseman, DA"

Limited investigation has been conducted to explore the potential role of lipid metabolism and its impact on the association between tooth loss and cognitive function. This study endeavored to identify the role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration among older adults and its contribution to the link between tooth loss and cognitive impairment.",2023,Cognitive function; High-density lipoprotein cholesterol; Lipid metabolism; Tooth loss,"Humans; Nutrition Surveys; Cholesterol, HDL; Tooth Loss; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition","Chen, HM; Li, KY; Li, TL; Kwong, E; Wong, GHY; McGrath, C; Chen, H"
Exercise training and BDNF injections alter amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing enzymes and improve cognition.,"Exercise reduces cognitive aging, neurodegeneration, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Acute exercise reduces the activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of Aβ. However, mechanisms mediating these effects remain largely unknown. Work has implicated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). BDNF is an exercise-induced neurotrophin known for its role in synaptic plasticity, neurite growth, and neuronal survival. Previously, our lab has shown using an ex vivo model that treatment of the prefrontal cortex with BDNF reduced BACE1 activity, highlighting a BDNF to BACE1 link. The purpose of this research was to examine whether BDNF treatments resulted in similar biochemical adaptations to APP processing as exercise training.

Selenoprotein P concentrations and risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.,"There is a growing literature investigating the effects of selenium on the central nervous system and cognitive function. However, little is known about the role of selenoprotein P, the main selenium transporter, which can also have adverse biological effects. We conducted a prospective cohort study of individuals aged 42-81 years who received a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. Using sandwich ELISA methods, we measured full-length selenoprotein P concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid to assess the relation with dementia incidence during a median follow-up of 47.3 months. We used Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic splines to model such relation. Of the 54 participants, 35 developed dementia during follow-up (including 26 cases of Alzheimer's dementia). Selenoprotein P concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were highly correlated, and in spline regression analyses they each showed a positive non-linear association with dementia risk, particularly after excluding dementia cases diagnosed within 24 months of follow-up. We also observed differences in association according to the dementia subtypes considered. Risk ratios of dementia peaked at 2-6 at the highest levels of selenoprotein P, when compared to its median level, also depending on matrix, analytical methodology and dementia subtype. Findings of this study, the first to assess selenoprotein P levels in the central nervous system in vivo and the first to use a prospective study design to evaluate associations with dementia, suggest that higher circulating concentrations of selenoprotein P, both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, predict progression of MCI to dementia. However, further confirmation of these findings is required, given the limited statistical precision of the associations and the potential for residual confounding.",2023,,Humans; Prospective Studies; Selenoprotein P; Selenium; Disease Progression; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers,"Vinceti, M; Urbano, T; Chiari, A; Filippini, T; Wise, LA; Tondelli, M; Michalke, B; Shimizu, M; Saito, Y"

Effects of Donepezil on the Musculoskeletal System in Female Rats.,"The extension of human life makes it more and more important to prevent and treat diseases of the elderly, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis. Little is known about the effects of drugs used in the treatment of AD on the musculoskeletal system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on the musculoskeletal system in rats with normal and reduced estrogen levels. The study was carried out on four groups of mature female rats: non-ovariectomized (NOVX) control rats, NOVX rats treated with donepezil, ovariectomized (OVX) control rats and OVX rats treated with donepezil. Donepezil (1 mg/kg p.o.) was administered for four weeks, starting one week after the ovariectomy. The serum concentrations of CTX-I, osteocalcin and other biochemical parameters, bone mass, density, mineralization, histomorphometric parameters and mechanical properties, and skeletal muscle mass and strength were examined. Estrogen deficiency increased bone resorption and formation and worsened cancellous bone mechanical properties and histomorphometric parameters. In NOVX rats, donepezil decreased bone volume to tissue volume ratio in the distal femoral metaphysis, increased the serum phosphorus concentration and tended to decrease skeletal muscle strength. No significant bone effects of donepezil were observed in OVX rats. The results of the present study indicate slightly unfavorable effects of donepezil on the musculoskeletal system in rats with normal estrogen levels.",2023,donepezil; estrogen deficiency; musculoskeletal system; osteoporosis; rats,"Humans; Rats; Female; Animals; Aged; Donepezil; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Acetylcholinesterase; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Estrogens; Ovariectomy","Londzin, P; Trawczyński, M; Cegieła, U; Czuba, ZP; Folwarczna, J"

Unfavorable effects of memantine on the skeletal system in female rats.,"Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). NMDA receptors are expressed on bone cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of memantine on the rat musculoskeletal system. Taking into account that most of female AD patients are postmenopausal, the study was carried out on intact and ovariectomized (estrogen-deficient) rats. Mature Wistar rats were divided into following groups: non-ovariectomized (NOVX) control rats, NOVX rats treated with memantine, ovariectomized (OVX) control rats, and OVX rats treated with memantine. Memantine (2 mg/kg p.o.) was administered once daily for four weeks, starting one week after ovariectomy. The serum bone turnover marker and cytokine levels, bone density, mass, mineralization, mechanical properties, histomorphometric parameters of compact and cancellous bone, skeletal muscle mass and grip strength were determined. In NOVX rats, memantine slightly decreased the strength of compact bone of the femoral diaphysis (parameters in the yield point) and unfavorably affected histomorphometric parameters of cancellous bone (the femoral epiphysis and metaphysis). In OVX rats, in which estrogen deficiency induced osteoporotic changes, memantine increased the phosphorus content in the femoral bone mineral. No other effects on bone were observed in the memantine-treated OVX rats. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated slight damaging skeletal effects of memantine in rats with normal estrogen levels.",2023,Estrogen deficiency; Memantine; Musculoskeletal system; Osteoporosis; Rats,"Rats; Female; Animals; Humans; Rats, Wistar; Memantine; Bone and Bones; Estrogens; Bone Density; Ovariectomy","Londzin, P; Cegieła, U; Trawczyński, M; Czuba, ZP; Folwarczna, J"
"Associations between circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA, inflammatory markers, and cognitive and physical outcomes in community dwelling older adults.","Dementia and frailty are common age-related syndromes often linked to chronic inflammation. Identifying the biological factors and pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation is crucial for developing new therapeutic targets. Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) has been proposed as an immune stimulator and potential predictor of mortality in acute illnesses. Dementia and frailty are both associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired cellular energetics, and cell death. The size and abundance of ccf-mtDNA fragments may indicate the mechanism of cell death: long fragments typically result from necrosis, while short fragments arise from apoptosis. We hypothesize that increased levels of necrosis-associated long ccf-mtDNA fragments and inflammatory markers in serum are linked to declines in cognitive and physical function, as well as increased mortality risk.",2023,Cell-free DNA; Dementia; Frailty; Inflammation; Mitochondria; sTNFR1,,"Nidadavolu, LS; Feger, D; Chen, D; Wu, Y; Grodstein, F; Gross, AL; Bennett, DA; Walston, JD; Oh, ES; Abadir, PM"

"Low circulating choline, a modifiable dietary factor, is associated with the pathological progression and metabolome dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.","Most Americans (∼90%) are deficient in dietary choline, an essential nutrient. Associations between circulating choline and pathological progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unknown. Here, we examined these associations and performed a metabolomic analysis in blood serum from severe AD, moderate AD, and healthy controls. Additionally, to gain mechanistic insight, we assessed the effects of dietary choline deficiency (Ch-) in 3xTg-AD mice and choline supplementation (Ch+) in APP/PS1 mice. In humans, we found AD-associated reductions in choline, it's derivative acetylcholine (ACh), and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. Choline and ACh were negatively correlated with Plaque density, Braak stage, and TNFα, but positively correlated with MMSE and brain weight. Metabolites L-Valine, 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic, Methylmalonic, and Ferulic acids were associated with choline levels. In mice, Ch-paralleled AD severe, but Ch+ was protective. In conclusion, low circulating choline is associated with AD-neuropathological progression, illustrating the importance of dietary choline consumption to offset disease.",2023,,,"Judd, JM; Jasbi, P; Winslow, W; Serrano, GE; Beach, TG; Klein-Seetharaman, J; Velazquez, R"

Impact of sex on neuroimmune contributions to Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation has been observed in both the idiopathic and familial forms of PD. Importantly, PD is reported more often in men than in women, men having at least 1.5- fold higher risk to develop PD than women. This review summarizes the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the neuroimmune contributions to PD and its investigation in animal models of PD. Innate and peripheral immune systems participate in the brain neuroinflammation of PD patients and is reproduced in neurotoxin, genetic and α-synuclein based models of PD. Microglia and astrocytes are the main cells of the innate immune system in the central nervous system and are the first to react to restore homeostasis in the brain. Analysis of serum immunoprofiles in female and male control and PD patients show that a great proportion of these markers differ between males and females. The relationship between cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory markers and PD clinical characteristics or PD biomarkers shows sex differences. Conversely, in animal models of PD, sex differences in inflammation are well documented and the beneficial effects of endogenous and exogenous estrogenic modulation in inflammation have been reported. Targeting neuroinflammation in PD is an emerging therapeutic option but gonadal drugs have not yet been investigated in this respect, thus offering new opportunities for sex specific treatments.",2023,Astrocyte; Glia; Inflammation; Microglia; Parkinson; Sex,Animals; Female; Male; Parkinson Disease; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; alpha-Synuclein; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain; Inflammation; Microglia,"Bourque, M; Morissette, M; Soulet, D; Di Paolo, T"

Evidence That Increasing Serum 25(OH)D Concentrations to 30 ng/mL in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates Could Greatly Improve Health Outcomes.,"Accumulating evidence supports the potential protective effects of vitamin D against chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease and stroke), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, stroke, and infectious diseases such as acute respiratory tract diseases, COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. The respective evidence is based on ecological and observational studies, randomized controlled trials, mechanistic studies, and Mendelian randomization studies. However, randomized controlled trials on vitamin D supplementation have largely failed to show benefits, probably due to poor design and analysis. In this work, we aim to use the best available evidence on the potential beneficial effects of vitamin D to estimate the expected reduction in incidence and mortality rates of vitamin D-related diseases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates if minimum serum 25(OH)D concentrations were to be raised to 30 ng/mL.

"Minocycline effects on memory and learning impairment in the beta-amyloid-induced Alzheimer's disease model in male rats using behavioral, biochemical, and histological methods.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), as an advanced neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the everlasting impairment of memory, which is determined by hyperphosphorylation of intracellular Tau protein and accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in the extracellular space. Minocycline is an antioxidant with neuroprotective effects that can freely cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study investigated the effect of minocycline on the changes in learning and memory functions, activities of blood serum antioxidant enzymes, neuronal loss, and the number of Aβ plaques after AD induced by Aβ in male rats. Healthy adult male Wistar rats (200-220g) were divided randomly into 11 groups (n = 10). The rats received minocycline (50 and 100 mg/kg/day; per os (P.O.)) before, after, and before/after AD induction for 30 days. At the end of the treatment course, behavioral performance was measured by standardized behavioral paradigms. Subsequently, brain samples and blood serum were collected for histological and biochemical analysis. The results indicated that Aβ injection impaired learning and memory performances in the Morris water maze test, reduced exploratory/locomotor activities in the open field test, and enhanced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. The behavioral deficits were accompanied by hippocampal oxidative stress (decreased glutathione (GSH) peroxidase enzyme activity and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the brain (hippocampus) tissue), increased number of Aβ plaques, and neuronal loss in the hippocampus evidenced by Thioflavin S and H&E staining, respectively. Minocycline improved anxiety-like behavior, recovered Aβ-induced learning and memory deficits, increased GSH and decreased MDA levels, and prevented neuronal loss and the accumulation of Aβ plaques. Our results demonstrated that minocycline has neuroprotective effects and can reduce memory dysfunction, which are due to its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Hippocampus; Minocycline; Morris water maze; Rats,"Rats; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Minocycline; Rats, Wistar; Antioxidants; Neuroprotective Agents; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Disease Models, Animal; Maze Learning; Hippocampus; Memory Disorders","Gholami Mahmoudian, Z; Ghanbari, A; Rashidi, I; Amiri, I; Komaki, A"
Mechano-Chemistry across Phase Transitions in Heated Albumin Protein Solutions.,"The presence of certain proteins in biofluids such as synovial fluid, blood plasma, and saliva gives these fluids non-Newtonian viscoelastic properties. The amount of these protein macromolecules in biofluids is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of various health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disorders, and joint quality. However, existing technologies for measuring the behavior of macromolecules in biofluids have limitations, such as long turnaround times, complex protocols, and insufficient sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose non-contact, optical Brillouin and Raman spectroscopy to assess the viscoelasticity and chemistry of non-Newtonian solutions, respectively, at different temperatures in several minutes. In this work, bovine and human serum albumin solution-based biopolymers were studied to obtain both their collective dynamics and molecular chemical evolution across heat-driven phase transitions at various protein concentrations. The observed phase transitions at elevated temperatures could be fully delayed in heated biopolymers by appropriately raising the level of protein concentration. The non-contact optical monitoring of viscoelastic and chemical property evolution could represent novel potential mechano-chemical biomarkers for disease diagnosis and subsequent treatment applications, including hyperthermia.",2023,Brillouin scattering; Raman scattering; albumin; denaturation; gelation; heating; mechano-chemical; phase transitions; polymer; protein; viscoelastic,,"Kharmyssov, C; Sekerbayev, K; Nurekeyev, Z; Gaipov, A; Utegulov, ZN"
Serum TCA cycle metabolites in Lewy bodies dementia and Alzheimer's disease: Network analysis and cognitive prognosis.,"Abnormalities in the Tri-Carboxylic-Acid (TCA) cycle have been documented in dementia. Through network analysis, TCA cycle metabolites could indirectly reflect known dementia-related abnormalities in biochemical pathways, and key metabolites might be associated with prognosis. This study analyzed TCA cycle metabolites as predictors of cognitive decline in a mild dementia cohort and explored potential interactions with the diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and APOE-ε4 genotype. We included 145 mild dementia patients (LBD = 59; AD = 86). Serum TCA cycle metabolites were analyzed at baseline, and partial correlation networks were conducted. Cognitive performance was measured annually over 5-years with the Mini-mental State Examination. Longitudinal mixed-effects Tobit models evaluated each baseline metabolite as a predictor of 5-years cognitive decline. APOE-ε4 and diagnosis interactions were explored. Results showed comparable metabolite concentrations in LBD and AD. Multiple testing corrected networks showed larger coefficients for a negative correlation between pyruvate - succinate and positive correlations between fumarate - malate and citrate - Isocitrate in both LBD and AD. In the total sample, adjusted mixed models showed significant associations between baseline citrate concentration and longitudinal MMSE scores. In APOE-ε4 carriers, baseline isocitrate predicted MMSE scores. We conclude that, in mild dementia, serum citrate concentrations could be associated with subsequent cognitive decline, as well as isocitrate concentrations in APOE-ε4 carriers. Downregulation of enzymatic activity in the first half of the TCA cycle (decarboxylating dehydrogenases), with upregulation in the latter half (dehydrogenases only), might be indirectly reflected in serum TCA cycle metabolites' networks.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Citric acid cycle; Cognitive decline; Dementia; Dementia with Lewy bodies,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Lewy Body Disease; Isocitrates; Lewy Bodies; Carboxylic Acids; Dementia; Apolipoproteins E; Oxidoreductases; Cognition,"Jaramillo-Jimenez, A; Giil, LM; Borda, MG; Tovar-Rios, DA; Kristiansen, KA; Bruheim, P; Aarsland, D; Barreto, GE; Berge, RK"
IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway and Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway has potential relevance for clinical identification and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, eight databases (including CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed, VIP, PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase and Web of Science) were employed to search for studies on IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway and its association with AD. Totally, 15 articles were included, of which 5 studies investigated the connection between IL-33 gene polymorphisms and AD, 4 studies explored the serum IL-33 and sST2 levels in patients with AD and Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and the exact mechanisms underlying IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway in AD were explored in 6 studies. Then, the RevMan 5.4 software was used for meta-analysis, and the related studies were systematically reviewed. The results of the meta-analysis showed that serum IL-33 levels were higher in patients with AD and MCI than in healthy controls (HC), with serum IL-33 levels in AD patients significantly higher than in MCI patients (SMD = 0.26, 95 % CI: 0.02, 0.51; P = 0.04). Compared with HC, the sST2 level was significantly higher in AD patients (SMD = 1.23, 95 % CI: 0.93, 1.53; P < 0.00001) and tended to elevate in patients with MCI. The systematic review indicated that there is a significant relationship between IL-33 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to AD; The IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway may be one of the future treatment targets for AD. Our study provides evidence to prove that serum IL-33 and sST2 have potential clinical application value as biomarkers for identifying AD.",2023,Alzheimer's Disease; IL-33; Meta-analysis; SST2; Systematic review,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein; Interleukin-33; Cognitive Dysfunction; Signal Transduction,"Jiang, T; Zheng, T; Li, W; Liu, N; Wang, M"

Thus, insulin resistance may provide pathophysiological clues to the occurrence of delirium.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF biomarkers; Delirium; Dementia; Hip fracture; Insulin resistance,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Insulin Resistance; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Hip Fractures; Insulin; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Wang, J; Shuang, P; Li, Z; Zhao, L; Wang, X; Liu, P"
PI3K-Akt signaling pathway based on network pharmacology for the anti-Alzheimer's disease effect of licorice stem flavonoids.,"Active ingredients were screened by TCMSP and swissADME, meanwhile, PharmMapper combined with UniProt database was used to predict the active ingredient target information, GeneCard database was employed to obtain Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related genes, Cytoscapes 3.7.2 software was utilized to map the active ingredient-target effect. Besides, Cytoscapes 3.7.2 software Bisogenet and Cyto NCA plug-in combined with STRING platform were utilized to map the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, DAVID was employed for GO annotation, while KEGG plug-in was used for KEGG pathway enrichment. Mice were tested for inflammatory damage induced by intracerebral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as learning memory and anxiety by water maze and open field tests. In addition, the expression of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9, together with inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β was analyzed in serum. The expression levels of proteins related to PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in the brain were detected by Western blot (WB) assay. According to the results of network pharmacology, there were 35 active ingredients of licorice stem and leaf flavonoids screened, which exerted the anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects via 67 targets and activated 41 signaling pathways including the PI3K-Akt pathway. Furthermore, Behavioural results revealed that Licorice stem and leaf flavonoids improved the learning and memory abilities of model mice and significantly improved the anxiety caused by inflammatory brain damage. Moreover, as suggested by HE staining and TUNEL staining of brain sections, Glycyrrhiza glabra stem and leaf flavonoids alleviated morphological lesions and cell nuclear damage in brain tissue. Results: of brain homogenate supernatant assay demonstrated that Glycyrrhiza glabra stem and leaf flavonoids had a significant effect on the levels of oxidative indicators superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malonaldehyde (MDA), acetylcholine (Ach), acetylcholinesterase (AchE), Caspase-3, Caspase-9 and serum inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β.

Effects of the aspect ratio of plasmonic gold nanorods on the inhibition of lysozyme amyloid formation.,"Amyloid formation due to altered protein folding and aggregation has gained significant attention due to its association with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and systemic lysozyme amyloidosis. Amyloids are characterized by parallel and anti-parallel cross-β-strands arranged to form stacks of sheets that provide stability and rigidity to the amyloid core. The prototypic protein Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL) has been extensively used to understand protein hydrolysis, fragmentation, folding, misfolding, and amyloid formation. In the present study, we have examined the efficacy of plasmonic gold nanorods (GNRs) as an anti-amyloid agent against HEWL amyloids. Our results reveal that (i) the amyloid inhibition by plasmonic GNRs is dependent on their aspect ratio, (ii) the large aspect ratio GNRs ameliorate amyloid assembly completely, and (iii) GNRs interfere at several stages along the lysozyme fibril-formation pathway and block the conversion of monomeric and oligomeric intermediates into mature fibrils. Using a multi-parametric approach, we demonstrate that GNRs drive HEWL into off-pathway and amyloid-incompetent forms. To establish GNRs as generic amyloid inhibitors, we extended our studies to another archetypal protein, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), and observed similar results of GNRs inhibiting BSA aggregation. We believe that our results will pave the way for the potential use of GNRs with current therapeutics to reduce the burden of amyloid-related diseases.",2023,,Muramidase; Gold; Amyloid; Nanotubes,"Rani, K; Pippal, B; Singh, SK; Karmakar, A; Vankayala, R; Jain, N"

A Novel Serum-Based Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using an Advanced Phage-Based Biochip.,"55 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD). A definitive diagnosis of AD is made postmortem after a neuropathological examination of the brain. There is an urgent need for an innovative, noninvasive methodology that allows for an early and reliable diagnosis. Several engineered phages that recognized Aβ-autoantibodies present in the sera of AD patients are previously identified. Here, novel phages are tested for their ability to accurately discriminate AD sera using immunophage-polymerase chain reaction in a miniatured biochip. It is found that five of the six phages analyzed discriminate between healthy controls and AD patients. Further, by combining the response of two phages, non-AD and severe AD cases are identified with 100% accuracy and mild-to-moderate cases with 90% accuracy. While the number of cases used here are relatively small and can be confirmed in larger cohorts, this first-of-a-kind system represents an innovative methodology with the potential of having a major impact in the AD field: from a clinical perspective, it can aid physicians in making an accurate AD diagnosis; from a research perspective, it can be used as a surrogate for AD clinical trials.",2023,A-beta; biomarker; biosensor; neurodegeneration; phage display,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Bacteriophages; Brain; Biomarkers,"Rizzo, MG; De Plano, LM; Palermo, N; Franco, D; Nicolò, M; Sciuto, EL; Calabrese, G; Oddo, S; Conoci, S; Guglielmino, SPP"
Quantitative detection of dopamine in human serum with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of constrained vibrational mode.,"Dopamine (DA) is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in the hormonal, nervous, and vascular systems being considered as an index to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we demonstrate the quantitative sensing of DA using the peak shift in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA), resulting from the concentration of DA. To enable the signal enhancement of Raman scattering, Ag nanostructure was built with one-step gas-flow sputtering. 4-MPBA was then introduced using vapor-based deposition, acting as a reporter molecule for bonding with DA.

Elevated CSF angiopoietin-2 correlates with blood-brain barrier leakiness and markers of neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Breakdown of the neurovascular unit in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to leakiness of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), contributing to cognitive decline and disease pathology. Vascular stability depends on angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) signalling, antagonised by angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) upon endothelial injury. We have examined the relationship between CSF ANGPT2 and CSF markers of BBB leakiness and disease pathology, across three independent cohorts: (i) 31 AD patients and 33 healthy controls grouped according to their biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and Aβ42 < 550 pg/mL); (ii) 121 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research study (84 participants cognitively unimpaired (CU) enriched for a parental history of AD, 19 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 21 with AD); (iii) a neurologically normal cohort aged 23-78 years with paired CSF and serum samples. CSF ANGPT2 level was measured by sandwich ELISA. In cohort (i), CSF ANGPT2 was elevated in AD, correlating with CSF t-tau and p-tau181 but not Aβ42. ANGPT2 also correlated positively with CSF sPDGFRβ and fibrinogen - markers of pericyte injury and BBB leakiness. In cohort (ii), CSF ANGPT2 was highest in MCI. CSF ANGT2 correlated with CSF albumin in the CU and MCI cohorts but not in AD. ANGPT2 also correlated with t-tau and p-tau and with markers of neuronal injury (neurogranin and α-synuclein) and neuroinflammation (GFAP and YKL-40). In cohort (iii), CSF ANGPT2 correlated strongly with the CSF:serum albumin ratio. Increased CSF ANGPT2 and the CSF:serum albumin ratio showed non-significant associations with elevated serum ANGPT2 in this small cohort. Together, these data indicate that CSF ANGPT2 is associated with BBB leakiness in early AD and is closely related to tau pathology and neuronal injury. The utility of serum ANGPT2 as a biomarker of BBB damage in AD requires further study.",2023,,,"Miners, J; van Hulle, C; Ince, S; Jonaitis, E; Okonkwo, OC; Bendlin, B; Johnson, S; Carlsson, C; Asthana, S; Love, S; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H"

Potential Biomarkers of impulsivity in mild traumatic brain injury: A pilot study.,"Very few studies have investigated cognition and impulsivity following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in the general population. Furthermore, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying post-TBI neurobehavioral syndromes are complex and remain to be fully clarified. Herein, we took advantage of machine learning based-modeling to investigate potential biomarkers of mTBI-associated impulsivity. Twenty-one mTBI patients were assessed within one-month post-TBI and their data were compared to 19 healthy controls on measures of impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - BIS), executive functioning, episodic memory, self-report cognitive failures and blood biomarkers of inflammation, vascular and neuronal damage. mTBI patients were significantly more impulsive than controls in BIS total and subscales. Serum levels of sCD40L, Cathepsin D, IL-4, Neuropilin-1, IFN-α2, and Copeptin were associated with impulsivity in mTBI patients. Besides showing that mTBI are associated with impulsivity in non-military people, we unveiled different pathophysiological pathways potentially implicated in mTBI-related impulsivity.",2023,Blood biomarkers; Impulsivity; Inhibitory control; Machine Learning; mTBI,Humans; Brain Concussion; Pilot Projects; Impulsive Behavior; Biomarkers; Executive Function,"Cardoso, MGF; de Barros, JLVM; de Queiroz, RAB; Rocha, NP; Silver, C; da Silva, AS; da Silva, EWM; Roque, IG; Carvalho, JL; Dos Santos, LF; Cota, LB; Lemos, LM; Miranda, MF; Miranda, MF; Vianna, PP; Oliveira, RA; de Oliveira Furlam, T; Soares, TSS; Pedroso, VSP; Faleiro, RM; Vieira, ÉLM; Teixeira, AL; de Souza, LC; de Miranda, AS"

Correlations between Cognitive Evaluation and Metabolic Syndrome.,"One of the most common medical diseases is metabolic syndrome (MetS), which encompasses diabetes and obesity. It has a systemic effect, which has long-lasting consequences on the body that are still not fully understood. The objectives of the study were to investigate the association between the severity of metabolic imbalances, insulin resistance, leptin concentration, and the presence of cognitive disorders and to assess the possible protective role of some classes of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and dyslipidemia in order to identify a viable target in the near future. The study included 148 diabetic patients. Standardized tests for the evaluation of cognition, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), were applied to all study participants. Serum concentrations of leptin and insulin were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (ELISA), and insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We found that MMSE and MoCA scores were associated with anthropometric parameters, and MoCA was associated with glycemic control parameters and leptin levels. Further research is needed in order to establish the magnitude of the relationship between metabolic syndrome components and cognitive decline in diabetic patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; insulin resistance; leptin; obesity; type 2 diabetes,,"Oprescu, AC; Grosu, C; Bild, W"
Recent advances in the production of oligogalacturonides and their biological properties.,"The human population is becoming old and ageing, which is related to a variety of health issues, such as Alzheimeŕs disease, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and some types of cancers like colorectal cancer. Furthermore, diet is a determining factor in the appearance of some of these diseases due to its direct effect at the systemic level (for instance, increase in glucose and LDL-cholesterol levels in the serum) and its influence on the composition and activity of the gut microbiota. In this context, the use of functional ingredients can be a useful strategy to prevent or even treat (in combination with drugs) some of the above-mentioned pathologies.

Higher CSF/serum free-T4 ratio is associated with improvement of quality of life during treatment with L-thyroxine.,"Up to 20% of individuals with primary hypothyroidism treated with L-thyroxine still suffer from severe symptoms. These are supposedly brain derived and involve both cognitive and emotional domains. Previously, no consistent relationship has been found between thyroid hormones (TH) or TSH levels in blood and quality of life (QoL). Recently, we reported an association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum free-thyroxine (f-T4) ratio and QoL, in juvenile hypothyroid patients. Here, we investigated if CSF/serum f-T4 ratio and QoL estimates correlate also during L-thyroxine treatment. Moreover, the CSF biomarker neurogranin (Ng) was used as a biomarker for synaptic function and integrity in clinical research. Ng is partially controlled by TH and therefore we investigated the relationship between QoL parameters and Ng levels. Patients diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism were investigated using vital parameters, serum and CSF analyses of TH, TSH, Ng and QoL questionnaires. Similar procedures were performed after 6 months of treatment. The most marked associations with QoL were found for CSF/serum f-T4 ratio, which was strongly related to several QoL parameters such as the mental subscore of SF-36 (r = 0.83, p < .0005). Ng, which did not differ from that in our healthy controls, was lower in some patients during treatment and higher in others. However, the change in Ng during treatment was significantly correlated with QoL parameters including the mental subscore of SF-36 (r = -0.86, p < .0001). In addition, the CSF/serum f-T4 ratio correlated with the change in Ng (r = -0.75, p = .001). Our results suggest that the ratio between CSF and serum f-T4 is an important biomarker for QoL during treatment of patients with primary hypothyroidism, so far in research, but in the future maybe also in clinical settings. Moreover, this ratio also correlates with the changes in Ng levels during L-thyroxine treatment, further supporting the impact of the TH balance between serum and CSF on QoL.",2023,cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; cognition; neurogranin; primary hypothyroidism; quality of life,Humans; Thyroxine; Quality of Life; Triiodothyronine; Thyrotropin; Thyroid Hormones; Hypothyroidism; Biomarkers,"Funkquist, A; Wandt, B; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Svensson, J; Bjellerup, P; Freund-Levi, Y; Sjöberg, S"

UHPLC-Orbitrap-Fusion-TMS-Based Metabolomics Study of Phenylpropionamides in the Seed of Cannabis sativa L. against Alzheimer's Disease.,"Phenylpropionamides in the seed of Cannabis sativa L. (PHS) have a protective effect on neuroinflammation and antioxidant activity. In this study, the UHPLC-Orbitrap-fusion-TMS-based metabolomics approach was used to analyze the serum samples and identify potential biomarkers in Streptozotocin (STZ) induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. The results revealed that primary bile acid biosynthesis and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism were significantly correlated with STZ-induced AD rats. In addition, the key enzymes in these two pathways were verified at the protein level. The levels of cysteine dioxygenase type I (CDO1), cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenase (ADO), 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) were the key enzymes affecting the two pathways in AD rats compared with the control group (CON). Furthermore, after a high-dose group of phenylpropionamides in the seed of Cannabis sativa L. (PHS-H) was administrated, the levels of CDO1, CSAD, CYP7A1, and CYP8B1 were all callback.

Increased Cerebral Serum Amyloid A2 and Parameters of Oxidation in Arylsulfatase B (N-Acetylgalactosamine-4-Sulfatase)-Null Mice.,"Chondroitin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and the impact of modified chondroitin sulfates is being investigated in several animal and cell-based models of AD. Published reports have shown the role of accumulation of chondroitin 4-sulfate and decline in Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; B-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase) in other pathology, including nerve injury, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. However, the impact of ARSB deficiency on AD pathobiology has not been reported, although changes in ARSB were associated with AD in two prior reports. The enzyme ARSB removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate and is required for their degradation.

Bioinformatic analysis of the SPs and NFTs proteomes unravel putative biomarker candidates for Alzheimer's disease.,"Aging is the main risk factor for the appearance of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most common form of dementia, characterized by the presence of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), the main histopathological hallmarks in AD brains. The core of these deposits are predominantly amyloid fibrils in SPs and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in NFTs, but other molecular components can be found associated with these pathological lesions. Herein, an extensive literature review was carried out to obtain the SPs and NFTs proteomes, followed by a bioinformatic analysis and further putative biomarker validation. For SPs, 857 proteins were recovered, and, for NFTs, 627 proteins of which 375 occur in both groups and represent the common proteome. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis permitted the identification of biological processes and the molecular functions most associated with these lesions. Analysis of the SPs and NFTs common proteins unraveled pathways and molecular targets linking both histopathological events. Further, validation of a putative phosphotarget arising from the in silico analysis was performed in serum-derived extracellular vesicles from AD patients.

The Beneficial Effect of Mitochondrial Transfer Therapy in 5XFAD Mice via Liver-Serum-Brain Response.,"We recently reported the benefit of the IV transferring of active exogenous mitochondria in a short-term pharmacological AD (Alzheimer's disease) model. We have now explored the efficacy of mitochondrial transfer in 5XFAD transgenic mice, aiming to explore the underlying mechanism by which the IV-injected mitochondria affect the diseased brain. Mitochondrial transfer in 5XFAD ameliorated cognitive impairment, amyloid burden, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Exogenously injected mitochondria were detected in the liver but not in the brain. We detected alterations in brain proteome, implicating synapse-related processes, ubiquitination/proteasome-related processes, phagocytosis, and mitochondria-related factors, which may lead to the amelioration of disease. These changes were accompanied by proteome/metabolome alterations in the liver, including pathways of glucose, glutathione, amino acids, biogenic amines, and sphingolipids. Altered liver metabolites were also detected in the serum of the treated mice, particularly metabolites that are known to affect neurodegenerative processes, such as carnosine, putrescine, C24:1-OH sphingomyelin, and amino acids, which serve as neurotransmitters or their precursors. Our results suggest that the beneficial effect of mitochondrial transfer in the 5XFAD mice is mediated by metabolic signaling from the liver via the serum to the brain, where it induces protective effects. The high efficacy of the mitochondrial transfer may offer a novel AD therapy.",2023,5XFAD; Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; cognition; mitochondria; mitochondrial transfer,"Mice; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Proteome; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Mitochondria; Mice, Transgenic; Liver","Sweetat, S; Nitzan, K; Suissa, N; Haimovich, Y; Lichtenstein, M; Zabit, S; Benhamron, S; Akarieh, K; Mishra, K; Barasch, D; Saada, A; Ziv, T; Kakhlon, O; Lorberboum-Galski, H; Rosenmann, H"
Non-Ceruloplasmin Copper Identifies a Subtype of Alzheimer's Disease (CuAD): Characterization of the Cognitive Profile and Case of a CuAD Patient Carrying an ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia whose cause is incompletely defined. Copper (Cu) involvement in AD etiology was confirmed by a meta-analysis on about 6000 participants, showing that Cu levels were decreased in AD brain specimens, while Cu and non-bound ceruloplasmin Cu (non-Cp Cu) levels were increased in serum/plasma samples. Non-Cp Cu was advocated as a stratification add-on biomarker of a Cu subtype of AD (CuAD subtype). To further circumstantiate this concept, we evaluated non-Cp Cu reliability in classifying subtypes of AD based on the characterization of the cognitive profile. The stratification of the AD patients into normal AD (non-Cp Cu ≤ 1.6 µmol/L) and CuAD (non-Cp Cu > 1.6 µmol/L) showed a significant difference in executive function outcomes, even though patients did not differ in disease duration and severity. Among the Cu-AD patients, a 76-year-old woman showed significantly abnormal levels in the Cu panel and underwent whole exome sequencing.

Hepatic and cardiac implications of increased toxic amyloid-beta serum level in lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation in rats: new insights into alleviating therapeutic interventions.,"Neuroinflammation is a devastating predisposing factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of clinical findings have reported peripheral disorders among AD patients. Amyloid beta (Aβ) is a toxic physiological aggregate that serves as a triggering factor for hepatic and cardiac disorders related to neurotoxicity. As a drawback of Aβ excessive accumulation in the brain, part of Aβ is believed to readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the peripheral circulation resulting in serious inflammatory and toxic cascades acting as a direct bridge to cardiac and hepatic pathophysiology. The main aim is to find out whether neuroinflammation-related AD may result in cardiac and liver dysfunctions. Potential therapeutic interventions are also suggested to alleviate AD's cardiac and hepatic defects. Male rats were divided into: control group I, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-neuroinflammatory-induced group II, LPS-neuroinflammatory-induced group treated with sodium hydrogen sulphide donor (NaHS) (group III), and LPS-neuroinflammatory-induced group treated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (group IV). Behavior and histopathological studies were conducted in addition to the estimation of different biological biomarkers. It was revealed that the increased toxic Aβ level in blood resulted in cardiac and hepatic malfunctions as a drawback of exaggerated inflammatory cascades. The administration of NaHS and MSCs proved their efficiency in combating neuroinflammatory drawbacks by hindering cardiac and hepatic dysfunctions. The consistent direct association of decreased heart and liver functions with increased Aβ levels highlights the direct involvement of AD in other organ complications. Thereby, these findings will open new avenues for combating neuroinflammatory-related AD and long-term asymptomatic toxicity.",2023,Albumin; Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ; Cardiac dysfunctions; Hepatic dysfunctions; Neuroinflammation,Rats; Male; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Lipopolysaccharides; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Liver,"Anwar, MM; Mabrouk, AA"

"[Mechanism of Sijunzi Decoction in treatment of Alzheimer's disease based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, network pharmacology, and experimental verification].","The study identified the blood-entering components of Sijunzi Decoction after gavage administration in rats by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS, and investigated the mechanism of Sijunzi Decoction in treating Alzheimer's disease by virtue of network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental verification. The blood-entering components of Sijunzi Decoction were identified based on the mass spectra and data from literature and databases. The potential targets of the above-mentioned blood-entering components in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease were searched against PharmMapper, OMIM, DisGeNET, GeneCards, and TTD. Next, STRING was employed to establish a protein-protein interaction(PPI) network. DAVID was used to perform the Gene Ontology(GO) annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway enrichment. Cytoscape 3.9.0 was used to carry out visual analysis. AutoDock Vina and PyMOL were used for molecular docking of the blood-entering components with the potential targets. Finally, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)/protein kinase B(Akt) signaling pathway enriched by the KEGG analysis was selected for validation by animal experiments. The results showed that 17 blood-entering components were detected in the serum samples after administration. Among them, poricoic acid B, liquiritigenin, atractylenolide Ⅱ, atractylenolide Ⅲ, ginsenoside Rb_1, and glycyrrhizic acid were the key components of Sijunzi Decoction in treating Alzheimer's disease. HSP90AA1, PPARA, SRC, AR, and ESR1 were the main targets for Sijunzi Decoction to treat Alzheimer's disease. Molecular docking showed that the components bound well with the targets. Therefore, we hypothesized that the mechanism of Sijunzi Decoction in treating Alzheimer's disease may be associated with the PI3K/Akt, cancer treatment, and mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) signaling pathways. The results of animal experiments showed that Sijunzi Decoction significantly attenuated the neuronal damage in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area, increased the neurons, and raised the ratios of p-Akt/Akt and p-PI3K/PI3K in the hippocampus of mice. In conclusion, Sijunzi Decoction may treat Alzheimer's disease by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Precise profiling of exosomal biomarkers via programmable curved plasmonic nanoarchitecture-based biosensor for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of complex pathogenesis, with overt symptoms following disease progression. Early AD diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of robust biomarkers and limited patient access to diagnostics via neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests. Exosomes present in body fluids are attracting attention as diagnostic biomarkers that directly reflect neuropathological features within the brain. In particular, exosomal miRNAs (exomiRs) signatures are involved in AD pathogenesis, showing a different expression between patients and the healthy controls (HCs). However, low yield and high homologous nature impede the accuracy and reproducibility of exosome blood-based AD diagnostics. Here, we developed a programmable curved plasmonic nanoarchitecture-based biosensor to analyze exomiRs in clinical serum samples for accurate AD diagnosis. To allow the detection of exomiRs in serum at attomolar levels, nanospaces (e.g., nanocrevice and nanocavity) were introduced into the nanostructures to dramatically increase the spectral sensitivity by adjusting the bending angle of the plasmonic nanostructure through sodium chloride concentration control. The developed biosensor classifies individuals into AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and HCs through profiling and quantifying exomiRs.

The Pathological Effects of Circulating Hydrophobic Bile Acids in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Recent clinical studies have revealed that the serum levels of toxic hydrophobic bile acids (deoxy cholic acid, lithocholic acid [LCA], and glycoursodeoxycholic acid) are significantly higher in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) when compared to control subjects. The elevated serum bile acids may be the result of hepatic peroxisomal dysfunction. Circulating hydrophobic bile acids are able to disrupt the blood-brain barrier and promote the formation of amyloid-β plaques through enhancing the oxidation of docosahexaenoic acid. Hydrophobic bile acid may find their ways into the neurons via the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter. It has been shown that hydrophobic bile acids impose their pathological effects by activating farnesoid X receptor and suppressing bile acid synthesis in the brain, blocking NMDA receptors, lowering brain oxysterol levels, and interfering with 17β-estradiol actions such as LCA by binding to E2 receptors (molecular modelling data exclusive to this paper). Hydrophobic bile acids may interfere with the sonic hedgehog signaling through alteration of cell membrane rafts and reducing brain 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol. This article will 1) analyze the pathological roles of circulating hydrophobic bile acids in the brain, 2) propose therapeutic approaches, and 3) conclude that consideration be given to reducing/monitoring toxic bile acid levels in patients with AD or aMCI, prior/in combination with other treatments.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blocking NMDA receptors; blood-brain barrier; declining cognitive function; liver dysfunction; serum bile acids,,"Ehtezazi, T; Rahman, K; Davies, R; Leach, AG"

HDL-Based Therapy: Vascular Protection at All Stages.,"It is known that lipid metabolism disorders are involved in a wide range of pathologies. These pathologies include cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative diseases, and even cancer. All these diseases lead to serious health consequences, which makes it impossible to ignore them. Unfortunately, these diseases most often have a complex pathogenesis, which makes it difficult to study them and, in particular, diagnose and treat them. HDL is an important part of lipid metabolism, performing many functions under normal conditions. One of such functions is the maintaining of the reverse cholesterol transport. These functions are also implicated in pathology development. Thus, HDL contributes to vascular protection, which has been demonstrated in various conditions: Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, etc. Many studies have shown that serum levels of HDL cholesterol correlate negatively with CV risk. With these data, HDL-C is a promising therapeutic target. In this manuscript, we reviewed HDL-based therapeutic strategies that are currently being used or may be developed soon.",2023,ASCVD; CVD; HDL; atherosclerosis; cancer; cardiovascular disease; diabetes mellitus,,"Poznyak, AV; Sukhorukov, VN; Eremin, II; Nadelyaeva, II; Gutyrchik, NA; Orekhov, AN"
An Amperometric Acetylcholine Biosensor Based on Co-Immobilization of Enzyme Nanoparticles onto Nanocomposite.,"An electrochemical biosensor was fabricated using nanoparticles of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (ChO)/Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs)/porous graphene oxide nanosheet (GONS) composite. A pencil graphite electrode (PGE) was used for the electrodeposition of nanocomposite and the determination of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter. Various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used for characterization. This biosensor (AChENPs-ChONPs/GONS/PtNPs/PGE) indicated a very short response time (3 s), a lower limit of detection (0.001 µM), good linearity (0.001-200 µM), longer storage stability (6 months) and better reproducibility. The percent analytical recoveries of added acetylcholine in serum (5.0 and 10 µM) were found to be 97.6 ± 0.7 and 96.5 ± 0.3 for the present biosensor. The coefficients of variation were obtained to be 8% and 3.25%, correspondingly. The biosensor was applied to measure the ACh amount in the serum of healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Elevated Soluble TNF-Receptor 1 in the Serum of Predementia Subjects with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.,"Tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNF-R1)-mediated signaling is critical to the regulation of inflammatory responses. TNF-R1 can be proteolytically released into systemic blood circulation in a soluble form (sTNF-R1), where it binds to circulating TNF and functions to attenuate TNF-mediated inflammation. Increases of peripheral sTNF-R1 have been reported in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and vascular dementia (VaD). However, the status of sTNF-R1 in predementia subjects (cognitive impairment, no dementia, CIND) is unknown, and putative associations with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), as well as with longitudinal changes in cognitive functions are unclear. We measured baseline serum sTNF-R1 in a longitudinally assessed cohort of 93 controls and 103 CIND, along with neuropsychological evaluations and neuroimaging assessments.

Cathepsin B Deficiency Improves Memory Deficits and Reduces Amyloid-β in hAβPP Mouse Models Representing the Major Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease Condition.,"The lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) has been suggested as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because elevated serum CTSB in AD patients has been found to correlate with cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, CTSB gene knockout (KO) in non-transgenic and transgenic AD animal models showed that elimination of CTSB improved memory deficits. However, conflicting CTSB KO results on amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology in transgenic AD models have been reported. The conflict is resolved here as likely being due to the different hAβPP transgenes used in the different AD mouse models. CTSB gene KO reduced wild-type (Wt) β-secretase activity, brain Aβ, pyroglutamate-Aβ, amyloid plaque, and memory deficits in models that used cDNA transgenes expressing hAβPP isoform 695. But in models that used mutated mini transgenes expressing hAβPP isoforms 751 and 770, CTSB KO had no effect on Wt β-secretase activity and slightly increased brain Aβ. All models expressed the AβPP transgenes in neurons. These conflicting results in Wt β-secretase activity models can be explained by hAβPP isoform specific cellular expression, proteolysis, and subcellular processing. CTSB KO had no effect on Swedish mutant (Swe) β-secretase activity in hAβPP695 and hAβPP751/770 models. Different proteolytic sensitivities for hAβPP with Wt versus Swe β-secretase site sequences may explain the different CTSB β-secretase effects in hAβPP695 models. But since the vast majority of sporadic AD patients have Wt β-secretase activity, the CTSB effects on Swe β-secretase activity are of little importance to the general AD population. As neurons naturally produce and process hAβPP isoform 695 and not the 751 and 770 isoforms, only the hAβPP695 Wt models mimic the natural neuronal hAβPP processing and Aβ production occurring in most AD patients. Significantly, these CTSB KO findings in the hAβPP695 Wt models demonstrate that CTSB participates in memory deficits and production of pyroglutamate-Aβ (pyroglu-Aβ), which provide rationale for future investigation of CTSB inhibitors in AD therapeutics development.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; AβPP isoform; amyloid-β; cDNA; cathepsin B; gene; memory deficits; mouse models; neuron; promoter; β-secretase,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Cathepsin B; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Memory Disorders; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Mice, Transgenic","Hook, G; Kindy, M; Hook, V"
Cognitive correlates of antisaccade behaviour across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.,"Oculomotor tasks generate a potential wealth of behavioural biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Overlap between oculomotor and disease-impaired circuitry reveals the location and severity of disease processes via saccade parameters measured from eye movement tasks such as prosaccade and antisaccade. Existing studies typically examine few saccade parameters in single diseases, using multiple separate neuropsychological test scores to relate oculomotor behaviour to cognition; however, this approach produces inconsistent, ungeneralizable results and fails to consider the cognitive heterogeneity of these diseases. Comprehensive cognitive assessment and direct inter-disease comparison are crucial to accurately reveal potential saccade biomarkers. We remediate these issues by characterizing 12 behavioural parameters, selected to robustly describe saccade behaviour, derived from an interleaved prosaccade and antisaccade task in a large cross-sectional data set comprising five disease cohorts (Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and cerebrovascular disease; ",2023,antisaccade; cognitive impairment; dementia; neurodegenerative disease; prosaccade,,"Riek, HC; Brien, DC; Coe, BC; Huang, J; Perkins, JE; Yep, R; McLaughlin, PM; Orange, JB; Peltsch, AJ; Roberts, AC; Binns, MA; Lou, W; Abrahao, A; Arnott, SR; Beaton, D; Black, SE; Dowlatshahi, D; Finger, E; Fischer, CE; Frank, AR; Grimes, DA; Kumar, S; Lang, AE; Lawrence-Dewar, JM; Mandzia, JL; Marras, C; Masellis, M; Pasternak, SH; Pollock, BG; Rajji, TK; Sahlas, DJ; Saposnik, G; Seitz, DP; Shoesmith, C; Steeves, TDL; Strother, SC; Sunderland, KM; Swartz, RH; Tan, B; Tang-Wai, DF; Tartaglia, MC; Turnbull, J; Zinman, L; Munoz, DP"
Human neurons lacking amyloid precursor protein exhibit cholesterol-associated developmental and presynaptic deficits.,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) produces aggregable β-amyloid peptides and its mutations are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), which makes it one of the most studied proteins. However, APP's role in the human brain remains unclear despite years of investigation. One problem is that most studies on APP have been carried out in cell lines or model organisms, which are physiologically different from human neurons in the brain. Recently, human-induced neurons (hiNs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a practical platform for studying the human brain in vitro. Here, we generated APP-null iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and differentiate them into matured human neurons with functional synapses using a two-step procedure. During hiN differentiation and maturation, APP-null cells exhibited less neurite growth and reduced synaptogenesis in serum-free but not serum-containing media. We have found that cholesterol (Chol) remedies those developmental defects in APP-null cells, consistent with Chol's role in neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis. The phenotypic rescue was also achieved by coculturing those cells with wild-type mouse astrocytes, suggesting that APP's developmental role is likely astrocytic. Next, we examined matured hiNs using patch-clamp recording and detected reduced synaptic transmission in APP-null cells. This change was largely due to decreased synaptic vesicle (SV) release and retrieval, which was confirmed by live-cell imaging using two SV-specific fluorescent reporters. Adding Chol shortly before stimulation mitigated the SV deficits in APP-null iNs, indicating that APP facilitates presynaptic membrane Chol turnover during the SV exo-/endocytosis cycle. Taken together, our study in hiNs supports the notion that APP contributes to neurodevelopment, synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission via maintaining brain Chol homeostasis. Given the vital role of Chol in the central nervous system, the functional connection between APP and Chol bears important implications in the pathogenesis of AD.",2024,amyloid precursor protein; cholesterol; iPSC; neuron; presynaptic,"Animals; Humans; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Astrocytes; Cell Differentiation; Cholesterol; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Presynaptic Terminals; Synapses; Female; Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mesa, H; Zhang, EY; Wang, Y; Zhang, Q"
Independent role of Alzheimer's disease genetics and C-reactive protein on cognitive ability in aging.,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), has been associated with cognitive decline independent from AD pathology, but the role for other LOAD risk genes in normal cognitive aging is less studied. We examined the effect of APOE ε4 and several different polygenic risk scores (PRS) for LOAD on cognitive level and decline in aging, using longitudinal data from the UK Biobank. While PRS-LOAD including all variants (except APOE) predicted cognitive level, APOE ε4 and PRS-LOAD based on 17 non-APOE gene variants with strong association to AD (p < 5e-8) predicted age-related decline in verbal numeric reasoning. The effect on decline were partly driven by 4 variants involved in the immune system. Those variants also predicted serum levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP), but CRP did not mediate the effect on decline. Those findings suggest genetic variations in immune functions play a role in aspects of cognitive aging that may be independent of LOAD pathology as well as systemic inflammation measured by CRP.",2023,APOE; Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive aging; Pathway-based PRS-LOAD; Polygenic risk scores; Serum CRP,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; C-Reactive Protein; Apolipoprotein E4; Aging; Cognition; Apolipoproteins E,"Supiyev, A; Karlsson, R; Wang, Y; Koch, E; Hägg, S; Kauppi, K"

Excess Cu promotes the formation of oxidative stress, which is thought to be a major cause for development and progression of neurological diseases (NDs). Most selenoproteins exhibit antioxidative properties and may counteract oxidative stress. However, expression of selenoproteins is altered under conditions of Se deficiency.

Beyond the amyloid hypothesis: how current research implicates autoimmunity in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"The amyloid hypothesis has so far been at the forefront of explaining the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and eventual death. Recent evidence, however, points to additional factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. These include the neurovascular hypothesis, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, the prion hypothesis, the mutational accumulation hypothesis, and the autoimmunity hypothesis. The purpose of this review was to briefly discuss the factors that are associated with autoimmunity in humans, including sex, the gut and lung microbiomes, age, genetics, and environmental factors. Subsequently, it was to examine the rise of autoimmune phenomena in AD, which can be instigated by a blood-brain barrier breakdown, pathogen infections, and dysfunction of the glymphatic system. Lastly, it was to discuss the various ways by which immune system dysregulation leads to AD, immunomodulating therapies, and future directions in the field of autoimmunity and neurodegeneration. A comprehensive account of the recent research done in the field was extracted from PubMed on 31 January 2022, with the keywords ""Alzheimer's disease"" and ""autoantibodies"" for the first search input, and ""Alzheimer's disease"" with ""IgG"" for the second. From the first search, 19 papers were selected, because they contained recent research on the autoantibodies found in the biofluids of patients with AD. From the second search, four papers were selected. The analysis of the literature has led to support the autoimmune hypothesis in AD. Autoantibodies were found in biofluids (serum/plasma, cerebrospinal fluid) of patients with AD with multiple methods, including ELISA, Mass Spectrometry, and microarray analysis. Through continuous research, the understanding of the synergistic effects of the various components that lead to AD will pave the way for better therapeutic methods and a deeper understanding of the disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Autoantibodies; amyloid hypothesis; autoimmunity; biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Autoimmunity; Autoantibodies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Chatanaka, MK; Sohaei, D; Diamandis, EP; Prassas, I"
"Association between serum iron, blood lead, cadmium, mercury, selenium, manganese and low cognitive performance in old adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES): a cross-sectional study.","Cognitive decline is a public health problem for the world's ageing population.

Data of this cross-sectional study were extracted from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES 2011-2014). Cognitive performance was measured by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), Animal Fluency and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) tests. Weighted univariable and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between six trace elements and low cognitive performance. Subgroup analyses based on diabetes and hypertension history were further assessed the associations. A total of 2002 adults over 60 years old were included. After adjusting covariates, elevated serum Fe levels were associated with the decreased risk of low cognitive performance, especially in the elderly without diabetes history and with hypertension history. High blood Cd levels were associated with the high odds of low cognitive performance in old adults with diabetes and hypertension history. Elevated blood Mn levels were connected with low cognitive performance in old hypertensive people. High blood Pb levels were related to the high odds of low cognitive performance, especially in the elderly without diabetes and hypertension history.

Plasma tau and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and their relation to cognitive functions.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia. The cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with this disorder often have overlapping characteristics, potentially resulting in delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. This study aimed to assess the level of peripheral blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) and total tau (t-tau) protein in AD patients and investigate their relationship with cognitive impairment. The study included 80 participants of both sexes between the ages of 60 to 85 years. The participants were divided into two groups, consisting of 40 individuals in the control group (mean age 75±6.6 years) who had no cognitive or functional impairments and 40 AD patients (mean age 74.98±5.03 years). This study utilized the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for major or mild neurocognitive disorder attributed to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The clinical and biochemical features of all participants were documented, and the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores were evaluated. Sandwich ELISA was employed to determine serum NfL and t-tau protein levels. The median serum NfL and t-tau protein levels in AD patients were significantly higher than those of the controls (47.84 pg/ml versus 17.66 pg/ml and 12.05 pg/ml versus 11.13 pg/ml, respectively). Age was positively correlated with NfL, t-tau levels, and ADAS-cog.

Sensitive label-free detection of the biomarker phosphorylated tau-217 protein in Alzheimer's disease using a graphene-based solution-gated field effect transistor.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is generally diagnosed using advanced imaging, but recent research suggests early screening using biomarkers in peripheral blood is feasible; among them, plasma tau proteins phosphorylated at threonine 231, threonine 181, and threonine 217 (p-tau217) are potential targets. A recent study indicates that the p-tau217 protein is the most efficacious biomarker. However, a clinical study found a pg/ml threshold for AD screening beyond standard detection methods. A biosensor with high sensitivity and specificity p-tau217 detection has not yet been reported. In this study, we developed a label-free solution-gated field effect transistor (SGFET)-based biosensor featuring a graphene oxide/graphene (GO/G) layered composite. The top layer of bilayer graphene grown using chemical vapor deposition was functionalized with oxidative groups serving as active sites for forming covalent bonds with the biorecognition element (antibodies); the bottom G could act as a transducer to respond to the attachment of the target analytes onto the top GO conjugated with the biorecognition element via π-π interactions between the GO and G layers. With this unique atomically layered G composite, we obtained a good linear electrical response in the Dirac point shift to p-tau217 protein concentrations in the range of 10 fg/ml to 100 pg/ml. The biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity of 18.6 mV/decade with a high linearity of 0.991 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); in human serum albumin, it showed approximately 90% of the sensitivity (16.7 mV/decade) in PBS, demonstrating high specificity.

Synthesis of benzylidene-indandione derivatives as quantification of amyloid fibrils.,"The formation of amyloid fibrils due to its association with fatal diseases, including Alzheimer's, has been investigated by many researchers. These common diseases, mostly become verified when it is too late to be treated. Currently, no cure is available for neurodegenerative diseases, and the process of diagnosing amyloid fibrils in the early stages, while there are fewer amyloid fibrils, has become an issue of interest. To do so, determining new probes with the highest binding affinity to the lowest number of amyloid fibrils is necessary. In this study, we proposed to employ new synthesized benzylidene-indandione derivatives as amyloid fibrils fluorescent detection probes. Native soluble proteins of insulin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), BSA amorphous aggregation, and insulin amyloid fibrils were used to evaluate our compounds' specificity to the amyloid structure. While ten synthesized compounds were examined individually, four of them including 3d, 3g, 3i, and 3j showed a high binding affinity with selectivity and specificity to amyloid fibrils, and their binding properties were also confirmed with in silico analysis. The drug-likeness prediction results for selected compounds by Swiss ADME server shows a satisfactory percentage of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and gastrointestinal (GI) absorption for the compounds 3g, 3i, and 3j.

"Serum neurofilament light chain, brain infarcts, and the risk of stroke: a prospective population-based cohort study.","Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a neuron-specific protein, has been related to several neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, elevated levels of NfL have also been observed in patients admitted to the hospital for stroke, suggesting that NfL as a biomarker may extend well beyond neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, using data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), a population-based cohort study, we prospectively investigated the association of serum NfL levels with incident stroke and brain infarcts. During a follow-up of 3603 person-years, 133 (16.3%) individuals developed incident stroke, including ischemic and hemorrhagic. The HR (95%CI) of incident stroke was 1.28 (95%CI 1.10-1.50) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase of log10 NfL serum levels. Compared to participants in the first tertile of NfL (i.e., lower levels), the risk of stroke was 1.68 times higher (95%CI 1.07-2.65) in those in the second tertile and 2.35 times higher (95%CI 1.45-3.81) in those in the third tertile of NfL. NfL levels were also positively associated with brain infarcts; 1-SD in log10 NfL levels was associated with 1.32 (95%CI 1.06-1.66) higher odds of one or more brain infarcts. These results suggest that NfL may serve as a biomarker of stroke in older adults.",2023,Brain infarcts; Epidemiology; Incidence; MRI; Neurofilament light chain; Stroke,Aged; Humans; Biomarkers; Brain Infarction; Cohort Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Prospective Studies; Stroke; Incidence,"Dhana, A; DeCarli, C; Aggarwal, NT; Dhana, K; Desai, P; Evans, DA; Rajan, KB"

Extremes of baseline cognitive function determine the severity of delirium: a population study.,"Although delirium is a significant clinical and public health problem, little is understood about how specific vulnerabilities underlie the severity of its presentation. Our objective was to quantify the relationship between baseline cognition and subsequent delirium severity. We prospectively investigated a population-representative sample of 1510 individuals aged ≥70 years, of whom 209 (13.6%) were hospitalized across 371 episodes (1999 person-days assessment). Baseline cognitive function was assessed using the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, supplemented by verbal fluency measures. We estimated the relationship between baseline cognition and delirium severity [Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS)] and abnormal arousal (Observational Scale of Level of Arousal), adjusted by age, sex, frailty and illness severity. We conducted further analyses examining presentations to specific hospital settings and common precipitating aetiologies. The median time from baseline cognitive assessment to admission was 289 days (interquartile range 130 to 47 days). In admitted patients, delirium was present on at least 1 day in 45% of admission episodes. The average number of days with delirium (consecutively positive assessments) was 3.9 days. Elective admissions accounted for 88 bed days (4.4%). In emergency (but not elective) admissions, we found a non-linear U-shaped relationship between baseline global cognition and delirium severity using restricted cubic splines. Participants with baseline cognition 2 standard deviations below average (z-score = -2) had a mean MDAS score of 14 points (95% CI 10 to 19). Similarly, those with baseline cognition z-score = + 2 had a mean MDAS score of 7.9 points (95% CI 4.9 to 11). Individuals with average baseline cognition had the lowest MDAS scores. The association between baseline cognition and abnormal arousal followed a comparable pattern. C-reactive protein ≥20 mg/l and serum sodium <125 mM/l were associated with more severe delirium. Baseline cognition is a critical determinant of the severity of delirium and associated changes in arousal. Emergency admissions with lowest and highest baseline cognition who develop delirium should receive enhanced clinical attention.",2023,baseline cognitive function; delirium; epidemiology,Humans; Delirium; Prospective Studies; Cognition; Research Design,"Tsui, A; Yeo, N; Searle, SD; Bowden, H; Hoffmann, K; Hornby, J; Goslett, A; Weston-Clarke, M; Lanham, D; Hogan, P; Seeley, A; Rawle, M; Chaturvedi, N; Sampson, EL; Rockwood, K; Cunningham, C; Ely, EW; Richardson, SJ; Brayne, C; Terrera, GM; Tieges, Z; MacLullich, AMJ; Davis, D"

Hsp70.1 carbonylation induces lysosomal cell death for lifestyle-related diseases.,"Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) constitute increasingly prevalent disorders. Individuals with type 2 diabetes are well-known to be susceptible to Alzheimer's disease. Although the pathogenesis of each disorder is multifactorial and the causal relation remains poorly understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipid and protein oxidation conceivably plays a common role. Lipid peroxidation product was recently reported to be a key factor also for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, because of inducing hepatocyte degeneration/death. Here, we focus on implication of the representative lipid-peroxidation product 'hydroxynonenal' for the cell degeneration/death of brain, pancreas, and liver. Since Hsp70.1 has dual roles as a chaperone and lysosomal membrane stabilizer, hydroxynonenal-mediated oxidative injury (carbonylation) of Hsp70.1 was highlighted. After intake of high-fat diets, oxidation of free fatty acids in mitochondria generates ROS which enhance oxidation of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) involved within biomembranes and generate hydroxynonenal. In addition, hydroxynonenal is generated during cooking deep-fried foods with vegetable oils especially containing linoleic acids. These intrinsic and exogenous hydroxynonenal synergically causes an increase in its serum and organ levels to induce Hsp70.1 oxidation. As it is amphiphilic; being water-soluble but displays strong lipophilic characteristics, hydroxynonenal can diffuse within the cells and react with targets like senile and/or atheromatous plaques outside the cells. Hydroxynonenal can deepen and expand lysosomal injuries by facilitating 'calpain-mediated cleavage of the carbonylated Hsp70.1'. Despite the unique anatomical, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of each organ for its specific disease, there should be a common cascade of the cell degeneration/death which is caused by hydroxynonenal. This review aims to implicate hydroxynonenal-mediated Hsp70.1 carbonylation for lysosomal membrane permeabilization/rupture and the resultant cathepsin leakage for inducing cell degeneration/death. Given the tremendous number of worldwide people suffering various lifestyle-related diseases, it is valuable to consider how ω-6 PUFA-rich vegetable oils is implicated for the organ disorder.",2022,Alzheimer’s disease; calpain-cathepsin hypothesis; hydroxynonenal; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; type 2 diabetes,,"Yamashima, T; Seike, T; Oikawa, S; Kobayashi, H; Kido, H; Yanagi, M; Yamamiya, D; Li, S; Boontem, P; Mizukoshi, E"

Pros and cons for statins use and risk of Parkinson's disease: An updated perspective.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative brain disease (NBD) after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statins are the most common lipid-lowering agents used in the management of dyslipidemia and the prevention of primary and secondary cardiovascular diseases (CVD) events. In addition, there is a controversial point regarding the role of serum lipids in the pathogenesis of PD. In this bargain, as statins reduce serum cholesterol so they affect the PD neuropathology in bidirectional ways either protective or harmful. Statins are not used in the management of PD, but they are frequently used in the cardiovascular disorders commonly associated with PD in the elderly population. Therefore, the use of statins in that population may affect PD outcomes. Concerning the potential role of statins on PD neuropathology, there are conflicts and controversies either protective against the development of PD or harmful by increasing the risk for the development of PD. Therefore, this review aimed to clarify the precise role of statins in PD regarding the pros and cons from published studies. Many studies suggest a protective role of statins against PD risk through the modulation of inflammatory and lysosomal signaling pathways. Nevertheless, other observations suggest that statin therapy may increase PD risk by diverse mechanisms including reduction of CoQ10. In conclusion, there are strong controversies regarding the protective role of statins in PD neuropathology. Therefore, retrospective and prospective studies are necessary in this regard.",2023,Parkinson's disease; neurodegenerative brain disease; statins,Aged; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Parkinson Disease; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cardiovascular Diseases,"Al-Kuraishy, HM; Al-Gareeb, AI; Alexiou, A; Papadakis, M; Alsayegh, AA; Almohmadi, NH; Saad, HM; Batiha, GE"
"Donanemab Population Pharmacokinetics, Amyloid Plaque Reduction, and Safety in Participants with Alzheimer's Disease.","Donanemab is an amyloid-targeting therapy that resulted in robust amyloid plaque reduction and slowed Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression compared with placebo in the phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study (NCT03367403). The objectives of the current analyses are to characterize (i) the population pharmacokinetics of donanemab, (ii) the relationship between donanemab exposure and amyloid plaque reduction (response), and (iii) the relationship between donanemab exposure and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions (ARIA-E). Model development included data from participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild to moderate dementia due to AD from the phase Ib study on donanemab (NCT02624778) and participants with early symptomatic AD from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study. The analysis showed donanemab has a terminal elimination half-life of 11.8 days. Body weight and antidrug antibody titer impact donanemab exposure but not the pharmacodynamic response. Maintaining a donanemab serum concentration above 4.43 μg/mL (95% confidence interval: 0.956, 10.4) is associated with amyloid plaque reduction. The time to achieve amyloid plaque clearance (amyloid plaque level < 24.1 Centiloids) varied depending on the baseline amyloid level, where higher baseline levels were associated with fewer participants achieving amyloid clearance.

"Cardiovascular health profiles, systemic inflammation, and physical function in older adults: A population-based study.","We examined the association of modifiable cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics with physical function among rural older adults in China and the potential role of inflammatory mechanisms in the association. This study included 3733 stroke- and dementia-free participants (age ≥65 years; 56.9% women) in the baseline survey of a multimodal intervention study in rural China. From March-September 2018, data were collected via face-to-face interviews, clinical assessments, and laboratory tests. The Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB) test was performed to assess physical function. We defined six modifiable CVH metrics according to the modified American Heart Association's recommendations. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 was measured in a subsample (n = 1156). Data were analyzed with multiple general linear and logistic regression models and structural equation modeling. Poor physical function (SPPB score ≤9) was defined in 1443 participants. Ideal CVH (vs. poor CVH) was associated with multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of 0.60 (95%CI 0.48-0.75) for poor physical function. Ideal CVH was significantly associated with higher scores on balance, chair stand, and walking speed tests (all p < 0.05). Moreover, ideal CVH profile was associated with lower serum IL-6 (multivariable-adjusted β=-0.04; 95% CI -0.06, -0.01). Mediation analysis revealed that serum IL-6 accounted for 14% of the association of CVH with total SPPB score and 10% of the association with walking speed score (p < 0.05). This study suggests that an ideal CVH profile is associated with better physical function among stroke- and dementia-free older adults, partly via inflammatory mechanisms. The preventive implications of these findings warrant further investigation in cohort studies.",2023,Cardiovascular health metrics; Interleukin 6; Physical function; Population-based study; Rural elderly,Humans; Female; United States; Aged; Male; Cardiovascular Diseases; Interleukin-6; Surveys and Questionnaires; Stroke; Inflammation; Risk Factors; Health Status,"Fan, D; Chen, X; Fa, W; Liang, X; Han, X; Wang, Y; Cong, L; Liang, Y; Welmer, AK; Hou, T; Du, Y; Qiu, C"
Tyrosine-Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal-Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags.,"Beta-site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence-templated AgNPs/Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF) composite is modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag (ph-AgNPs@MOF) is captured in microplate surface by the conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph-AgNPs@MOF tags is transferred to the screen-printed graphene electrode (SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1 to 200 pM with a detection limit of 0.8 pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.",2023,beta-site secretase; electrochemical tags; metal-organic frameworks; silver nanoparticles; tyrosine conjugation,Humans; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Silver; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Metal Nanoparticles; Tyrosine; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,"Zhou, Y; Huang, Z; Liu, J; Dong, H; Zhang, Y; Xu, M; Bi, Y"
Butyrate ameliorates quinolinic acid-induced cognitive decline in obesity models.,"Obesity is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease associated with cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease. Low-grade inflammation is common in obesity, but the mechanism between inflammation and cognitive impairment in obesity is unclear. Accumulative evidence shows that quinolinic acid (QA), a neuroinflammatory neurotoxin, is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative processes. We investigated the role of QA in obesity-induced cognitive impairment and the beneficial effect of butyrate in counteracting impairments of cognition, neural morphology, and signaling. We show that in human obesity, there was a negative relationship between serum QA levels and cognitive function and decreased cortical gray matter. Diet-induced obese mice had increased QA levels in the cortex associated with cognitive impairment. At single-cell resolution, we confirmed that QA impaired neurons, altered the dendritic spine's intracellular signal, and reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Using Caenorhabditis elegans models, QA induced dopaminergic and glutamatergic neuron lesions. Importantly, the gut microbiota metabolite butyrate was able to counteract those alterations, including cognitive impairment, neuronal spine loss, and BDNF reduction in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Finally, we show that butyrate prevented QA-induced BDNF reductions by epigenetic enhancement of H3K18ac at BDNF promoters. These findings suggest that increased QA is associated with cognitive decline in obesity and that butyrate alleviates neurodegeneration.",2023,Aging; Metabolism; Neurodegeneration; Obesity,Mice; Animals; Humans; Quinolinic Acid; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Butyrates; Obesity; Cognitive Dysfunction; Inflammation,"Ge, X; Zheng, M; Hu, M; Fang, X; Geng, D; Liu, S; Wang, L; Zhang, J; Guan, L; Zheng, P; Xie, Y; Pan, W; Zhou, M; Zhou, L; Tang, R; Zheng, K; Yu, Y; Huang, XF"

miRNAs and Alzheimer's Disease: Exploring the Role of Inflammation and Vitamin E in an Old-Age Population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia worldwide and represents one of the leading factors for severe disability in older persons. Although its etiology is not fully known yet, AD may develop due to multiple factors, including inflammation and oxidative stress, conditions where microRNAs (miRNAs) seem to play a pivotal role as a molecular switch. All these aspects may be modulated by nutritional factors. Among them, vitamin E has been widely studied in AD, given the plausibility of its various biological functions in influencing neurodegeneration. From a cohort of old-aged people, we measured eight vitamin E forms (tocopherols and tocotrienols), thirty cytokines/chemokines, and thirteen exosome-extracted miRNAs in plasma of subjects suffering from subjects affected by AD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). The sample population included 80 subjects (40 AD and 40 HC) with a mean age of 77.6 ± 3.8 years, mostly women (45; 56.2%). Of the vitamin E forms, only α-tocopherol differed between groups, with significantly lower levels in AD. Regarding the examined inflammatory molecules, G-CSF, GM-CSF, INF-α2, IL-3, and IL-8 were significantly higher and IL-17 lower in AD than HC. Among all miRNAs examined, AD showed downregulation of miR-9, miR-21, miR29-b, miR-122, and miR-132 compared to controls. MiR-122 positively and significantly correlated with some inflammatory molecules (GM-CSF, INF-α2, IL-1α, IL-8, and MIP-1β) as well as with α-tocopherol even after correction for age and gender. A final binary logistic regression analysis showed that α-tocopherol serum levels were associated with a higher AD probability and partially mediated by miR-122. Our results suggest an interplay between α-tocopherol, inflammatory molecules, and microRNAs in AD, where miR-122 may be a good candidate as modulating factor.",2023,aging; inflammation; miRNAs; oxidative stress; vitamin E,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; alpha-Tocopherol; Alzheimer Disease; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Inflammation; Interleukin-8; MicroRNAs; Vitamin E","Boccardi, V; Poli, G; Cecchetti, R; Bastiani, P; Scamosci, M; Febo, M; Mazzon, E; Bruscoli, S; Brancorsini, S; Mecocci, P"

Donepezil halts acetic acid-induced experimental colitis in rats and its associated cognitive impairment through regulating inflammatory/oxidative/apoptotic cascades: An add-on to its anti-dementia activity.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is regarded as a risk factor for cognitive impairment. Donepezil (DON), a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), is approved for the management of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to scrutinize the impact of DON on acetic acid (AA)-induced UC in rats and to evaluate its ability to attenuate inflammatory response, oxidative strain, and apoptosis in this model and its associated cognitive deficits. Rats were categorized into: normal, DON, AA, and AA + DON groups. DON (5 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 14 days either alone or beginning with the day of UC induction. Colitis was evoked by a single transrectal injection of 1 ml of 4 % acetic acid. Results revealed that DON significantly improved the behavioral abnormalities with the mitigation of inflammation, apoptosis, and histopathological changes in the hippocampi of the colitis group. Moreover, DON significantly alleviated the macroscopic and microscopic changes associated with colitis. Interestingly, DON inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines via suppression of AA-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in the colon, along with serum IL-1β. DON inhibited colon lipid peroxidation, restored the antioxidants with a significant amelioration of the degree of neutrophil infiltration, and repressed colitis-induced matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) production. Furthermore, DON decreased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 protein expressions. Eventually, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, DON suppressed nitric oxide (NO) release, demonstrating the ability of DON to significantly curtail inflammation in immune cells. Taken together, DON ameliorated experimental colitis and its linked cognitive dysfunction, possibly via its antioxidant effect and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. Thereby, DON could be a therapeutic nominee for UC and associated neurological disorders.",2023,Apoptosis; Cognitive impairment; Donepezil; Pro-inflammatory cytokines; RAW 264.7 macrophage cells; Ulcerative colitis,"Rats; Animals; Donepezil; Acetic Acid; Acetylcholinesterase; Colitis; Colitis, Ulcerative; Colon; Antioxidants; Cytokines; Inflammation; NF-kappa B; Oxidative Stress; Cognitive Dysfunction","Elbaz, EM; Essam, RM; Ahmed, KA; Safwat, MH"

Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in Alzheimer's disease: role of tryptophan metabolites generated by gut host-microbiota.,"Gut microbiota in interaction with intestinal host tissues influences many brain functions and microbial dysbiosis has been linked with brain disorders, such as neuropsychiatric conditions and Alzheimer's disease (AD). L-tryptophan metabolites and short-chained fatty acids (SCFA) are major messengers in the microbiota-brain axis. Aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) are main targets of tryptophan metabolites in brain microvessels which possess an enriched expression of AhR protein. The Ah receptor is an evolutionarily conserved, ligand-activated transcription factor which is not only a sensor of xenobiotic toxins but also a pleiotropic regulator of both developmental processes and age-related tissue degeneration. Major microbiota-produced tryptophan metabolites involve indole derivatives, e.g., indole 3-pyruvic acid, indole 3-acetaldehyde, and indoxyl sulfate, whereas indoleamine and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO/TDO) of intestine host cells activate the kynurenine (KYN) pathway generating KYN metabolites, many of which are activators of AhR signaling. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the serum level of indoxyl sulfate which promotes AD pathogenesis, e.g., it disrupts integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and impairs cognitive functions. Activation of AhR signaling disturbs vascular homeostasis in brain; (i) it controls blood flow via the renin-angiotensin system, (ii) it inactivates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), thus impairing NO production and vasodilatation, and (iii) it induces oxidative stress, stimulates inflammation, promotes cellular senescence, and enhances calcification of vascular walls. All these alterations are evident in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in AD pathology. Moreover, AhR signaling can disturb circadian regulation and probably affect glymphatic flow. It seems plausible that dysbiosis of gut microbiota impairs the integrity of BBB via the activation of AhR signaling and thus aggravates AD pathology. KEY MESSAGES: Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Tryptophan metabolites are major messengers from the gut host-microbiota to brain. Tryptophan metabolites activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling in brain. The expression of AhR protein is enriched in brain microvessels and blood-brain barrier. Tryptophan metabolites disturb brain vascular integrity via AhR signaling.

A study of the relationship between serum uric acid levels and pain in patients with migraine.,"Serum uric acid (SUA), the end product of purine metabolism acts as an antioxidant and is related to oxidative stress. It has been reported that SUA may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, studies evaluating SUA levels in migraine are scarce. This study aimed to explore the relationship between pain characteristics and SUA levels in patients with migraine and compare SUA levels in migraine patients during a headache attack and headache-free period with those control groups. This prospective, cross-sectional study included 78 patients with migraine and 78 healthy subjects who were randomly selected from hospital personnel as the control group. Headache characteristics (duration of attack, pain intensity, and headache frequency) and sociodemographic features were recorded. The SUA level was measured once in the control group and twice in the migraine patients, during the migraine attack and headache-free periods. Although the SUA levels of the migraine group in the headache-free period were higher than those of the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. Gender was not significantly related to the change in SUA levels between the attack and headache-free period. When the correlation between age, duration of migraine, frequency, duration, and intensity of pain was evaluated; the difference between SUA levels in female migraine patients was weakly correlated with headache intensity, whereas male patients had a moderate correlation. ( P < .05; R > 0.250, and R > 0.516, respectively). The difference in SUA level in the migraine attack period compared to the headache-free period showing a positive correlation with pain intensity suggested that SUA may have a role in migraine due to its antioxidant role.",2023,,Humans; Male; Female; Uric Acid; Antioxidants; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prospective Studies; Migraine Disorders; Headache,"Altunkaynak, Y; Keskek, A; Donmezler, S; Yazar, T; Olgun, H; Delen, F; Kurt Sabitay, I; Ozturk, M; Ertem, DH"

The inhibition of ORMDL3 prevents Alzheimer's disease through ferroptosis by PERK/ATF4/HSPA5 pathway.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with high incidence and widespread attention. There is currently no clear clarification of the pathogenesis. However, ORMDL3 causes ferroptosis in AD, and the potential mechanisms remain unclear. So, this study explore the function of ORMDL3 on ferroptosis in AD and its potential regulatory mechanisms. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and C57BL/6 mice were induced into the mice model. The murine microglial BV-2 cells also were induced into the vitro model. In serum samples of AD patients, ORMDL3 mRNA expression levels were upregulated. The serum ORMDL3 levels expression was positively related to the ADL score or MoCA score in AD patients. The serum ORMDL3 expression level was positively related to MMSE score or Hcy levels in AD patients. The mRNA expression of ORMDL3 in the hippocampal tissue of the mice model of AD was upregulated at one, four and eight months. The protein expression of ORMDL3 was upregulated in the mice model of AD. ORMDL3 promoted Alzheimer's disease, and increased oxidative response and ferroptosis in a model of AD. PERK/ATF4/HSPA5 pathway is one important signal pathway for the effects of ORMDL3 in a model of AD. Collectively, these data suggested that ORMDL3 promoted oxidative response and ferroptosis in a model of AD by the PERK/ATF4/HSPA5 pathway, which might be a novel target spot mechanism of ferroptosis in AD and may serve as a regulator of AD-induced ferroptosis.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; ORMDL3; PERK; ferroptosis,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Ferroptosis; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Disease Models, Animal; RNA, Messenger; Membrane Proteins","Shao, Y; Xu, Y; Di, H; Shi, X; Wang, Y; Liu, H; Song, L"

Nicked tRNAs are stable reservoirs of tRNA halves in cells and biofluids.,"Nonvesicular extracellular RNAs (nv-exRNAs) constitute the majority of the extracellular RNAome, but little is known about their stability, function, and potential use as disease biomarkers. Herein, we measured the stability of several naked RNAs when incubated in human serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We identified extracellularly produced tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs) with half-lives of several hours in CSF. Contrary to widespread assumptions, these intrinsically stable small RNAs are full-length tRNAs containing broken phosphodiester bonds (i.e., nicked tRNAs). Standard molecular biology protocols, including phenol-based RNA extraction and heat, induce the artifactual denaturation of nicked tRNAs and the consequent in vitro production of tDRs. Broken bonds are roadblocks for reverse transcriptases, preventing amplification and/or sequencing of nicked tRNAs in their native state. To solve this, we performed enzymatic repair of nicked tRNAs purified under native conditions, harnessing the intrinsic activity of phage and bacterial tRNA repair systems. Enzymatic repair regenerated an RNase R-resistant tRNA-sized band in northern blot and enabled RT-PCR amplification of full-length tRNAs. We also separated nicked tRNAs from tDRs by chromatographic methods under native conditions, identifying nicked tRNAs inside stressed cells and in vesicle-depleted human biofluids. Dissociation of nicked tRNAs produces single-stranded tDRs that can be spontaneously taken up by human epithelial cells, positioning stable nv-exRNAs as potentially relevant players in intercellular communication pathways.",2023,RNA stability; extracellular RNA; liquid biopsies; tRF; tRNA halves,"Humans; RNA, Transfer; RNA; Bacteria; Epithelial Cells","Costa, B; Li Calzi, M; Castellano, M; Blanco, V; Cuevasanta, E; Litvan, I; Ivanov, P; Witwer, K; Cayota, A; Tosar, JP"
Molecular and Computational Analysis Identify Statins as Selective Inhibitors of Human Butyrylcholinesterase.,"Cholinesterase enzyme family consists of acetylcholinesterase (AChE, 3.1.1.7), the major enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, 3.1.1.8) a detoxification enzyme of plasma. Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications utilized as protective medicaments in stroke and Alzheimer's disease, which cholinesterases are associated with. Thus, in this study, we characterized the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of common statins, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin, on human erythrocyte AChE and purified serum BChE using in vitro and in silico methods.

Brain network decoupling with increased serum neurofilament and reduced cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neurofilament light chain, a putative measure of neuronal damage, is measurable in blood and CSF and is predictive of cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. There has been limited prior work linking neurofilament light and functional connectivity, and no prior work has investigated neurofilament light associations with functional connectivity in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Here, we assessed relationships between blood neurofilament light, cognition, and functional connectivity in a cross-sectional sample of 106 autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers and 76 non-carriers. We employed an innovative network-level enrichment analysis approach to assess connectome-wide associations with neurofilament light. Neurofilament light was positively correlated with deterioration of functional connectivity within the default mode network and negatively correlated with connectivity between default mode network and executive control networks, including the cingulo-opercular, salience, and dorsal attention networks. Further, reduced connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and executive control networks was associated with reduced cognitive function. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that neurofilament levels and functional connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and the dorsal attention network explained significant variance in cognitive composite scores when controlling for age, sex, and education. A mediation analysis demonstrated that functional connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode network and dorsal attention network partially mediated the relationship between blood neurofilament light levels and cognitive function. Our novel results indicate that blood estimates of neurofilament levels correspond to direct measurements of brain dysfunction, shedding new light on the underlying biological processes of Alzheimer's disease. Further, we demonstrate how variation within key brain systems can partially mediate the negative effects of heightened total serum neurofilament levels, suggesting potential regions for targeted interventions. Finally, our results lend further evidence that low-cost and minimally invasive blood measurements of neurofilament may be a useful marker of brain functional connectivity and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.",2023,NfL; default mode network; enrichment; functional connectivity; neurodegeneration; resting state,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Connectome; Nerve Net,"Wheelock, MD; Strain, JF; Mansfield, P; Tu, JC; Tanenbaum, A; Preische, O; Chhatwal, JP; Cash, DM; Cruchaga, C; Fagan, AM; Fox, NC; Graff-Radford, NR; Hassenstab, J; Jack, CR; Karch, CM; Levin, J; McDade, EM; Perrin, RJ; Schofield, PR; Xiong, C; Morris, JC; Bateman, RJ; Jucker, M; Benzinger, TLS; Ances, BM; Eggebrecht, AT; Gordon, BA"
Vascular injury is associated with repetitive head impacts and tau pathology in chronic traumatic encephalopathy.,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease linked to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and characterized by perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) deposits. The role of vascular injury, blood-brain barrier leakage, and neuroinflammation in CTE pathogenesis is not well understood. We performed quantitative immunoassays for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) within the postmortem dorsolateral frontal cortex of participants with and without a history of RHI and CTE (n = 156), and tested for associations with RHI, microgliosis, and tau pathology measures. Levels of vascular injury-associated markers ICAM1, VCAM1, and CRP were increased in CTE compared to RHI-exposed and -naïve controls. ICAM1 and CRP increased with RHI exposure duration (p < 0.01) and were associated with increased microglial density (p < 0.001) and tau pathology (AT8, p-tau396, p-tau202; p < 0.05). Histologically, there was significantly increased ICAM1 staining of the microvasculature, extracellular space, and astrocytes at the sulcal depths in high stage CTE compared to both low stage CTE and controls. Multifocal perivascular immunoreactivity for serum albumin was present in all RHI-exposed individuals. These findings demonstrate that vascular injury markers are associated with RHI exposure, duration, and microgliosis, are elevated in CTE, and increase with disease severity.",2023,Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); Inflammation; Neurodegeneration; RHI; Vascular injury; p-tau,Humans; Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Vascular System Injuries; Frontal Lobe; Blood-Brain Barrier; tau Proteins,"Kirsch, D; Shah, A; Dixon, E; Kelley, H; Cherry, JD; Xia, W; Daley, S; Aytan, N; Cormier, K; Kubilus, C; Mathias, R; Alvarez, VE; Huber, BR; McKee, AC; Stein, TD"
Carrot and carotene and multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of the evidence.,"In recent years, the benefits of carrots and carotene in different areas of health have been examined. The purpose of this umbrella review was to identify the associations between carrots and carotene and multiple health outcomes. The review considered evidence from meta-analyses of interventional and observational studies of carrots and carotene and any health outcome. We comprehensively searched Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size using random and fixed effects models and the 95% confidence interval. A total of 1329 studies were searched, and 30 meta-analyses with 26 health outcomes were identified that met the eligibility criteria. Carrot intake was associated with a lower risk of multiple cancer outcomes including breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, urothelial cancer, and prostate cancer. Carotene intake was associated with a lower risk of fracture, age-related cataract, sunburn, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, and head and neck cancer (HNC).

Role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in Alzheimer's disease and neuroprotective effects of pegylated self-assembled nanoscaffolds.,"Neurodegeneration and synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) lead to impairment in memory functions. Neuroinflammation causes activation of microglia and astrocytes cells that locally and systemically produces inflammatory cytokines which can serve as early diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets in AD. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF α)) levels were estimated in serum, cerebral tissue, hepatic tissue, and renal tissue in treatment groups of scopolamine-induced amnesia mice model using ELISA protocol. The results showed that cerebral tissue of AD mice exhibited elevated levels of IL1β, IL6, IL10 and TNFα which indicate contribution of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the progression of AD. A significant reduction in the concentration of IL1β, IL-10 and TNF-α were noticed in serum, cerebral tissue and hepatic tissue of animal group treated with marketed memantine tablet (Admenta), pure memantine drug (MEMp), memantine-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) self-assembled nanoscaffolds (MEM-PLGA) SANs, Polyethylene Glycol coated memantine-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) self-assembled nanoscaffolds [(PEG-MEM-PLGA) SANs] and Polyethylene Glycol coated memantine-poly [(lactic-co-glycolic acid)] self-assembled nanoscaffolds grafted with Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cell ((PEG-MEM-PLGA) SANs-BMSc), whereas a high level of IL-6 was observed in hepatic tissue, cerebral tissue and renal tissues of normal and AD induced mice which showed the emerging potential of IL-6 cytokines that can trigger either neurons survival after injury or causing neurodegeneration and cell apoptosis.

Cardiolipin released by microglia can act on neighboring glial cells to facilitate the uptake of amyloid-β (1-42).,"Cardiolipin is a mitochondrial phospholipid that is also detected in serum inferring its extracellular release; however, this process has not been directly demonstrated for any of the brain cell types. Nevertheless, extracellular cardiolipin has been shown to modulate several neuroimmune functions of microglia and astrocytes, including upregulation of their endocytic activity. Low cardiolipin levels are associated with brain aging, and may thus hinder uptake of amyloid-β (Αβ) in Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that glial cells are one of the sources of extracellular cardiolipin in the brain parenchyma where this phospholipid interacts with neighboring cells to upregulate the endocytosis of Αβ. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry identified 31 different species of cardiolipin released from murine BV-2 microglial cells and revealed this process was accelerated by exposure to Aβ42. Extracellular cardiolipin upregulated internalization of fluorescently-labeled Aβ42 by primary murine astrocytes, human U118 MG astrocytic cells, and murine BV-2 microglia. Increased endocytic activity in the presence of extracellular cardiolipin was also demonstrated by studying uptake of Aβ42 and pHrodo™ Bioparticles™ by human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived microglia, as well as iPSC-derived human brain organoids containing microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Our observations indicate that Aβ42 augments the release of cardiolipin from microglia into the extracellular space, where it can act on microglia and astrocytes to enhance their endocytosis of Aβ42. Our observations suggest that the reduced glial uptake of Aβ due to the decreased levels of cardiolipin could be at least partially responsible for the extracellular accumulation of Aβ in aging and Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid Αβ42; Astrocytes; Brain organoids; Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs); Phagocytosis,Humans; Animals; Mice; Microglia; Cardiolipins; Alzheimer Disease; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Neuroglia; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Astrocytes,"Wenzel, TJ; Murray, TE; Noyovitz, B; Narayana, K; Gray, TE; Le, J; He, J; Simtchouk, S; Gibon, J; Alcorn, J; Mousseau, DD; Zandberg, WF; Klegeris, A"

Brain-derived tau: a novel blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration.,"Blood-based biomarkers for amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau show good diagnostic accuracies and agreements with their corresponding CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration [A/T/(N)] framework for Alzheimer's disease. However, the blood-based neurodegeneration marker neurofilament light is not specific to Alzheimer's disease while total-tau shows lack of correlation with CSF total-tau. Recent studies suggest that blood total-tau originates principally from peripheral, non-brain sources. We sought to address this challenge by generating an anti-tau antibody that selectively binds brain-derived tau and avoids the peripherally expressed 'big tau' isoform. We applied this antibody to develop an ultrasensitive blood-based assay for brain-derived tau, and validated it in five independent cohorts (n = 609) including a blood-to-autopsy cohort, CSF biomarker-classified cohorts and memory clinic cohorts. In paired samples, serum and CSF brain-derived tau were significantly correlated (rho = 0.85, P < 0.0001), while serum and CSF total-tau were not (rho = 0.23, P = 0.3364). Blood-based brain-derived tau showed equivalent diagnostic performance as CSF total-tau and CSF brain-derived tau to separate biomarker-positive Alzheimer's disease participants from biomarker-negative controls. Furthermore, plasma brain-derived tau accurately distinguished autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative diseases (area under the curve = 86.4%) while neurofilament light did not (area under the curve = 54.3%). These performances were independent of the presence of concomitant pathologies. Plasma brain-derived tau (rho = 0.52-0.67, P = 0.003), but not neurofilament light (rho = -0.14-0.17, P = 0.501), was associated with global and regional amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts. These results were further verified in two memory clinic cohorts where serum brain-derived tau differentiated Alzheimer's disease from a range of other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and atypical parkinsonian disorders (area under the curve up to 99.6%). Notably, plasma/serum brain-derived tau correlated with neurofilament light only in Alzheimer's disease but not in the other neurodegenerative diseases. Across cohorts, plasma/serum brain-derived tau was associated with CSF and plasma AT(N) biomarkers and cognitive function. Brain-derived tau is a new blood-based biomarker that outperforms plasma total-tau and, unlike neurofilament light, shows specificity to Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration. Thus, brain-derived tau demonstrates potential to complete the AT(N) scheme in blood, and will be useful to evaluate Alzheimer's disease-dependent neurodegenerative processes for clinical and research purposes.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; neurodegenerative disease; neurofilament light; plasma brain-derived-tau; total-tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Brain; Biomarkers,"Gonzalez-Ortiz, F; Turton, M; Kac, PR; Smirnov, D; Premi, E; Ghidoni, R; Benussi, L; Cantoni, V; Saraceno, C; Rivolta, J; Ashton, NJ; Borroni, B; Galasko, D; Harrison, P; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Karikari, TK"

Administration of Huperzine A microspheres ameliorates myocardial ischemic injury via α7nAChR-dependent JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor (AChEI) is well established as ﬁrst-line agents for relieving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Injectable sustained-release formulation of AChEI may be suitable for treating AD patients. However, it needs to know whether continuous inhibition of AChE could deteriorate or attenuate myocardial damage if myocardial ischemia (MI) occurs. Huperzine A microspheres (HAM) are a sustained-release formulation releasing sustainably huperzine A (an AChEI) for more than 7 days after a single dose of HAM. This study aimed to investigate the myocardial damage in an isoprenaline (ISO)-induced MI mice model during HAM treatment. The heart injury was evaluated by assaying serum CK-MB, Tn-I and observing histopathological changes. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines in serum were detected. The level of p-P65 and the expression of proteins in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway were assayed with Western blot. Administration with a single dose of HAM resulted in inhibiting the MI-induced increases of CK-MB and Tn-I, alleviating the damage of heart tissue, and decreasing the levels of TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, HAM decreased the levels of p-P65, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 in heart tissue. The effects of HAM could be weakened or abolished by the specific α7nAChR antagonist. These findings suggest that continuous AChE inhibition could protect the heart from ischemic damage during administration of sustained-release formulation of AChEI, which is associated with the anti-inflammatory effect of HAM by regulating α7nAChR-dependent JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.",2023,Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; Huperzine A microspheres; Inflammation; Myocardial ischemia; α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,Mice; Animals; alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor; Microspheres; Acetylcholinesterase; Delayed-Action Preparations; Myocardial Ischemia; Signal Transduction; Heart Injuries; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Janus Kinase 2,"Zhang, C; Li, M; Xie, W; Li, M; You, C; Wang, T; Fu, F"

Dynamic and static circulating cancer microRNA biomarkers - a validation study.,"For cancers and other pathologies, early diagnosis remains the most promising path to survival. Profiling of longitudinal cohorts facilitates insights into trajectories of biomarkers. We measured microRNA expression in 240 serum samples from patients with colon, lung, and breast cancer and from cancer-free controls. Each patient provided at least two serum samples, one prior to diagnosis and one following diagnosis. The median time interval between the samples was 11.6 years. Using computational models, we evaluated the circulating profiles of 21 microRNAs. The analysis yielded two sets of biomarkers, static ones that show an absolute difference between certain cancer types and controls and dynamic ones where the level over time provided higher diagnostic information content. In the first group, miR-99a-5p stands out for all three cancer types. In the second group, miR-155-5p allows to predict lung cancers and colon cancers.

However, a clear association between the levels of IL-17 and various neurodegenerative diseases is inconclusive due to lack of consistent results reported in several studies. Therefore, we designed and performed a meta-analysis study to assess the levels of IL-17 cytokine in various neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this meta-analysis study was to assess the level of IL-17 in cerebrospinal fluid/serum of the patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. An extensive search was performed on electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to find out the relevant studies for analysis. The quality of selected studies was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort and case control studies. The standardized mean difference of level of IL-17 in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and control was calculated using RevMan 5 software. A significant increase in the level of serum IL-17 was found to in the patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (p = 0.001) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (p = 0.009), whereas IL-17 level in serum of Parkinson's disease (p = 0.22), multiple sclerosis (p = 0.09), and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS patients (p = 0.34) was not found to be significant. IL-17 may be involved in regulation of neuronal inflammation during the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disease, and its specific inhibition could be a potential therapeutic target.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; IL-17; Neuroinflammation; Proinflammatory cytokine,"Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Interleukin-17; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Parkinson Disease; Cytokines; Multiple Sclerosis","Gautam, AS; Pulivarthi, CB; Singh, RK"

Trace elements and Alzheimer dementia in population-based studies: A bibliometric and meta-analysis.,"Alterations in the concentrations of trace elements may play a vital role in Alzheimer dementia progression. However, previous research results are inconsistent, and there is still a lack of review on the relationship between all the studied-trace elements and AD from various perspectives of population-based studies. In this study, we systematically reviewed previous population-based studies and identified the altered trace elements in AD patients. We searched the Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and Scopus database, and ultimately included 73 articles. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to explore the evolution of the field from an epidemiological perspective. Bibliometric data such as trace elements, biological materials, detection methods, cognitive tests, co-occurrence and co-citation statistics are all analyzed and presented in a quantitative manner. The 73 included studies analyzed 39 trace elements in total. In a further meta-analysis, standardized mean differences (SMDs) of 13 elements were calculated to evaluate their altered in AD patients, including copper, iron, zinc, selenium, manganese, lead, aluminum, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, mercury, cobalt, and manganese. We identified four trace elements-copper (serum), iron (plasma), zinc (hair), and selenium (plasma)-altered in AD patients, with SMDs of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10, 0.65), -0.68 (95% CI: -1.34, -0.02), -0.35 (95% CI: -0.62, -0.08), and -0.61 (95% CI: -0.97, -0.25), respectively. Finally, we formed a database of various trace element levels in AD patients and healthy controls.

"Multitargeted C9-substituted ester and ether derivatives of berberrubine for Alzheimer's disease: Design, synthesis, biological evaluation, metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetics.","Berberrubine is a naturally occurring isoquinoline alkaloid and a bioactive metabolite of berberine. Berberine exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities, including cholinesterase inhibition. The cholinesterase inhibitors provide symptomatic treatment for Alzheimer's disease; however, multitarget-directed ligands have the potential as disease-modifying therapeutics. Herein, we prepared a series of C9-substituted berberrubine derivatives intending to discover dual cholinesterase and beta-site amyloid-precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors. Most synthesized derivatives possessed balanced dual inhibition (AChE and BChE) activity in the submicromolar range and a moderate inhibition against BACE-1. Two most active ester derivatives, 12a and 11d, display inhibition of AChE, BChE, and BACE-1.

"Thiazolidin-4-one prevents against memory deficits, increase in phosphorylated tau protein, oxidative damage and cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer disease model: Comparison with donepezil drug.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized mostly by memory decline. The current therapeutic arsenal for treating AD is limited, and the available drugs only produce symptomatic benefits, but do not stop disease progression. The search for effective therapeutic alternatives with multitarget actions is therefore imperative. One such a potential alternative is thiazolidin-4-one, a compound that exhibits anti-amnesic, anticholinesterase, and antioxidant activities. The aim of this study was evaluated the effects of 2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)- 3-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl) thiazolidin-4-one (DS12) on memory and neurochemical parameters in a model of AD induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Adult male rats were divided into five groups: I, control (saline); II, DS12 (10 mg/kg); III, STZ; IV, STZ + DS12 (10 mg/kg); V, STZ + donepezil (5 mg/kg). The rats were orally treated with DS12 and donepezil for a period of 20 days. Memory, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, phosphorylated tau protein levels and oxidative stress were analyzed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Biochemical and hematological parameters were evaluated in the blood and serum. Memory impairment and the increase in AChE activity and phosphorylated tau protein level induced by STZ were prevented by DS12 and donepezil treatment. Streptozotocin induces an increase in reactive oxygen species levels and a decrease in catalase activity in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. DS12 treatment conferred protection from oxidative alterations in all brain structures. No changes were observed in serum biochemical parameters (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid, and urea) or hematological parameters, such as platelets, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total plasma protein. DS12 improved memory and neurochemical changes in an AD model and did not show toxic effects, suggesting the promising therapeutic potential of this compound.",2023,Acetylcholinesterase; Alzheimer’s disease; Brain; Oxidative stress; Tau protein; Thiazolidin-4-ones,"Rats; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Donepezil; tau Proteins; Streptozocin; Acetylcholinesterase; Oxidative Stress; Memory Disorders; Antioxidants; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Disease Models, Animal; Maze Learning","Dos Santos, A; Teixeira, FC; da Silva, DS; Veleda, TA; de Mello, JE; Luduvico, KP; Tavares, RG; Stefanello, FM; Cunico, W; Spanevello, RM"

"Investigation of Relationship Between Small Noncoding RNA (sncRNA) Expression Levels and Serum Iron, Copper, and Zinc Levels in Clinical Diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis Patients.","In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between microRNA (miRNA) expression levels and serum iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) levels in Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral venous blood containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) of MS patients and controls. Total RNA was labeled with Cy3-CTP fluorescent dye. Hybridization of samples was performed on microarray slides and arrays were scanned. Data argument and bioinformatics analysis were performed. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer method was used to measure serum Fe, Cu, and Zn levels. In our study, in bioinformatics analysis, although differently expressed miRNAs were not detected between 16 MS patients and 16 controls, hsa-miR-744-5p upregulation was detected between 4 MS patients and 4 controls. This may be stem from the patient group consisting of MS patients who have never had an attack for 1 year. Serum iron levels were detected significantly higher in the 16 MS patients compared to the 16 controls. This may be stem from the increase in iron accumulation based on inflammation in MS disease. According to the findings in our study, hsa-miR-744-5p upregulation has been determined as an early diagnostic biomarker for the development together of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus associated with insulin signaling, and Alzheimer's diseases. Therefore, hsa-miR-744-5p is recommended as an important biomarker for the development together of diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and MS disease.

Association between cholinesterase inhibitors and kidney function decline in patients with Alzheimer's dementia.,"Preclinical evidence shows that activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) may have direct and indirect beneficial effects on the kidney. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are specific Alzheimer's dementia (AD) therapies that block the action of cholinesterases and activate CAP. Here, we explored a plausible effect of ChEIs on slowing kidney function decline by comparing the risk of CKD progression among patients with newly diagnosed AD that initiated ChEI or not within 90 days. Using complete information of routine serum creatinine tests, we evaluated changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and defined the outcome of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression as the composite of an eGFR decline of over 30%, initiation of dialysis/transplant or death attributed to CKD. A secondary outcome was death. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios. Among 11, 898 patients, 6,803 started on ChEIs and 5,095 did not.

Pathway-based integration of multi-omics data reveals lipidomics alterations validated in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and risk loci carriers.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Despite increasing evidence of the importance of metabolic dysregulation in AD, the underlying metabolic changes that may impact amyloid plaque formation are not understood, particularly for late-onset AD. This study analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptomics, and proteomics data obtained from several data repositories to obtain differentially expressed (DE) multi-omics elements in mouse models of AD. We characterized the metabolic modulation in these data sets using gene ontology, transcription factor, pathway, and cell-type enrichment analyses. A predicted lipid signature was extracted from genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN) and subsequently validated in a lipidomic data set derived from cortical tissue of ABCA-7 null mice, a mouse model of one of the genes associated with late-onset AD. Moreover, a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) was performed to further characterize the association between dysregulated lipid metabolism in human blood serum and genes associated with AD risk. We found 203 DE transcripts, 164 DE proteins, and 58 DE GWAS-derived mouse orthologs associated with significantly enriched metabolic biological processes. Lipid and bioenergetic metabolic pathways were significantly over-represented across the AD multi-omics data sets. Microglia and astrocytes were significantly enriched in the lipid-predominant AD-metabolic transcriptome. We also extracted a predicted lipid signature that was validated and robustly modeled class separation in the ABCA7 mice cortical lipidome, with 11 of these lipid species exhibiting statistically significant modulations. MWAS revealed 298 AD single nucleotide polymorphisms-metabolite associations, of which 70% corresponded to lipid classes.

Ocular manifestations of central insulin resistance.,"Central insulin resistance, the diminished cellular sensitivity to insulin in the brain, has been implicated in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. However, whether and how central insulin resistance plays a role in the eye remains unclear. Here, we performed intracerebroventricular injection of S961, a potent and specific blocker of insulin receptor in adult Wistar rats to test if central insulin resistance leads to pathological changes in ocular structures. 80 mg of S961 was stereotaxically injected into the lateral ventricle of the experimental group twice at 7 days apart, whereas buffer solution was injected to the sham control group. Blood samples, intraocular pressure, trabecular meshwork morphology, ciliary body markers, retinal and optic nerve integrity, and whole genome expression patterns were then evaluated. While neither blood glucose nor serum insulin level was significantly altered in the experimental or control group, we found that injection of S961 but not buffer solution significantly increased intraocular pressure at 14 and 24 days after first injection, along with reduced porosity and aquaporin 4 expression in the trabecular meshwork, and increased tumor necrosis factor α and aquaporin 4 expression in the ciliary body. In the retina, cell density and insulin receptor expression decreased in the retinal ganglion cell layer upon S961 injection. Fundus photography revealed peripapillary atrophy with vascular dysregulation in the experimental group. These retinal changes were accompanied by upregulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes, downregulation of anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neurotrophic genes, as well as dysregulation of genes involved in insulin signaling. Optic nerve histology indicated microglial activation and changes in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, tumor necrosis factor α, and aquaporin 4. Molecular pathway architecture of the retina revealed the three most significant pathways involved being inflammation/cell stress, insulin signaling, and extracellular matrix regulation relevant to neurodegeneration. There was also a multimodal crosstalk between insulin signaling derangement and inflammation-related genes. Taken together, our results indicate that blocking insulin receptor signaling in the central nervous system can lead to trabecular meshwork and ciliary body dysfunction, intraocular pressure elevation, as well as inflammation, glial activation, and apoptosis in the retina and optic nerve. Given that central insulin resistance may lead to neurodegenerative phenotype in the visual system, targeting insulin signaling may hold promise for vision disorders involving the retina and optic nerve.",2023,brain; ciliary bodies; gene expression; inflammation; insulin receptor; insulin resistance; intraocular pressure; neurodegeneration; optic nerve; retina; retinal ganglion cells; trabecular meshwork,,"Faiq, MA; Sengupta, T; Nath, M; Velpandian, T; Saluja, D; Dada, R; Dada, T; Chan, KC"

The main reason is hormonal senescence after menopause, a period characterized by a decline in estrogen levels. Since the effectiveness of drugs currently approved for the treatment of AD is limited, it is necessary to seek the development of new therapeutic strategies. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in AD patients and individuals with dementia in general. The supplementation of this vitamin in dementia patients might be an interesting approach for increasing the effectiveness of pre-existing medications for dementia treatment. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin D treatment associated with memantine and donepezil in female mice submitted to ovariectomy (OVX) for five months and subjected to a dementia animal model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated amyloid βeta (Aβ",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Aβ peptide; Neuroinflammation; Ovariectomy; Vitamin D+memantine+donepezil,Mice; Female; Animals; Memantine; Donepezil; Neuroprotective Agents; Vitamin D; Interleukin-4; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Alzheimer Disease; Vitamins; Hippocampus; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Vieira, ADC; Medeiros, EB; Zabot, GC; Pereira, NS; do Nascimento, NB; Lidio, AV; Scheffer, ÂK; Rempel, LCT; Macarini, BMN; Costa, MA; Gonçalves, CL; Kucharska, E; Rodrigues, MS; Moreira, JCF; de Oliveira, J; Budni, J"

Electroacupuncture modulates gut microbiota in mice: A potential target in postoperative cognitive dysfunction.,"The detailed mechanism of inflammation in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether electroacupuncture (EA) ameliorates POCD by modulating gut microbial dysbiosis. Compared to the control group, mice in the EA group were treated at the acupoints Zusanli (ST36), Quchi (L111), Baihui (GV20), and Dazhui (GV14) 1 week before appendectomy. Novel object recognition and the Morris water maze tests were used to assess learning and spatial reference memory deficits, whereas hippocampus samples and stool samples were collected for central inflammatory tests and 16S-rRNA sequencing of intestinal flora, respectively. In amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice, EA enhanced spatial memory and learning deficits. The fecal microbial community was altered in APP/PS1 mice in the absence of EA following surgery. Among them, Coprococcus and Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the EA groups than in the control groups; however, Actinobacteriota, Helicobacteraceae, and Escherichia/shigella constitute the minor bacterial colonization in the EA groups. Furthermore, we found a significant negative correlation between Firmicutes and escape latency (Pearson correlation coefficient - 0.551, p < 0.01) and positive correlation between Proteobacteria and escape latency (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.462, p < 0.05). Electron microscopy revealed signs of blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairments and immunofluorescence images showed glial cells activated in the hippocampus of APP/PS mice without EA, and serum diamine oxidase levels were increased in these mice; whereas EA treatment significantly relieved the above pathological changes. Our findings implied that EA decreases hippocampal inflammation of APP/PS1 by upregulating benificial  gut microbiota, reducing BBB and intestinal barrier dysfunction, thus alleviates postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This may provide a novel target in POCD management.",2023,blood-brain barrier; electroacupuncture; gut microbiota; postoperative cognitive dysfunction,Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Postoperative Cognitive Complications; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Electroacupuncture; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Hippocampus; Inflammation,"Zhu, B; Zhou, Y; Zhou, W; Chen, C; Wang, J; Xu, S; Wang, Q"
Serum amyloid P component (SAP) modulates antidepressant effects through promoting membrane insertion of the serotonin transporter.,"Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a universal constituent of human amyloid deposits including those in Alzheimer's disease. SAP has been observed to be elevated in patients with depression, and higher SAP levels are associated with better response to the antidepressant escitalopram.

"β2-Microglobulin exacerbates neuroinflammation, brain damage, and cognitive impairment after stroke in rats.","β2-Microglobulin (β2M), a component of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, is associated with aging-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Although upregulation of β2M is considered to be highly related to ischemic stroke, the specific role and underlying mechanistic action of β2M are poorly understood. In this study, we established a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. We found that β2M levels in the cerebral spinal fluid, serum, and brain tissue were significantly increased in the acute period but gradually decreased during the recovery period. RNA interference was used to inhibit β2M expression in the acute period of cerebral stroke. Tissue staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and evaluation of cognitive function using the Morris water maze test demonstrated that decreased β2M expression in the ischemic penumbra reduced infarct volume and alleviated cognitive deficits, respectively. Notably, glial cell, caspase-1 (p20), and Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation as well as production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were also effectively inhibited by β2M silencing. These findings suggest that β2M participates in brain injury and cognitive impairment in a rat model of ischemic stroke through activation of neuroinflammation associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome.",2023,NLRP3 inflammasome; cognitive impairment; cognitive improvement; glial activation; infarct volume; ischemia; middle cerebral artery occlusion; neuroinflammation; stroke; β2 microglobulin,,"Chen, F; Liu, J; Li, FQ; Wang, SS; Zhang, YY; Lu, YY; Hu, FF; Yao, RQ"
Proteomics of serum exosomes identified fibulin-1 as a novel biomarker for mild cognitive impairment.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodrome of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Cognitive impairment patients often have a delayed diagnosis because there are no early symptoms or conventional diagnostic methods. Exosomes play a vital role in cell-to-cell communications and can act as promising biomarkers in diagnosing diseases. This study was designed to identify serum exosomal candidate proteins that may play roles in diagnosing MCI. Mass spectrometry coupled with tandem mass tag approach-based non-targeted proteomics was used to show the differentially expressed proteins in exosomes between MCI patients and healthy controls, and these differential proteins were validated using immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Correlation of cognitive performance with the serum exosomal protein level was determined. Nanoparticle tracking analysis suggested that there was a higher serum exosome concentration and smaller exosome diameter in individuals with MCI compared with healthy controls. We identified 69 exosomal proteins that were differentially expressed between MCI patients and healthy controls using mass spectrometry analysis. Thirty-nine exosomal proteins were upregulated in MCI patients compared with those in control patients. Exosomal fibulin-1, with an area under the curve value of 0.81, may be a biomarker for an MCI diagnosis. The exosomal protein signature from MCI patients reflected the cell adhesion molecule category. In particular, higher exosomal fibulin-1 levels correlated with lower cognitive performance. Thus, this study revealed that exosomal fibulin-1 is a promising biomarker for diagnosing MCI.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; cell adhesion molecule; diagnosis; exosomes; fibulin; mass spectrometry; mild cognitive impairment; nanoparticle tracking analysis; tandem mass tag,,"Chen, B; Song, L; Yang, J; Zhou, WY; Cheng, YY; Lai, YJ"

Testing the link between isoaspartate and Alzheimer's disease etiology.,"Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a damaging amino acid residue formed in proteins as a result of spontaneous deamidation. IsoAsp disrupts protein structures, making them prone to aggregation. Here we strengthened the link between isoAsp and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by novel approaches to isoAsp analysis in human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant blood protein and a major carrier of amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in blood. We discovered a reduced amount of anti-isoAsp antibodies (P < 0.0001), an elevated isoAsp level in HSA (P < 0.001), more HSA aggregates (P < 0.0001), and increased levels of free Aβ (P < 0.01) in AD blood compared to controls. We also found that deamidation significantly reduces HSA capacity to bind with Aβ and p-tau (P < 0.05). These suggest the presence in AD of a bottleneck in clearance of Aβ and p-tau, leading to their increased concentrations in the brain and facilitating their aggregations there.",2023,Alzheimer's disease (AD); aging; blood analysis; deamidation; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); human serum albumin (HSA); in vitro diagnostics; mass spectrometry; protein aggregation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Isoaspartic Acid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Blood Proteins; Brain,"Wang, J; Guo, C; Meng, Z; Zwan, MD; Chen, X; Seelow, S; Lundström, SL; Rodin, S; Teunissen, CE; Zubarev, RA"
A review on comparative studies addressing exosome isolation methods from body fluids.,"Exosomes emerged as valuable sources of disease biomarkers and new therapeutic tools. However, extracellular vesicles isolation with exosome-like characteristics from certain biofluids is still challenging which can limit their potential use in clinical settings. While ultracentrifugation-based procedures are the gold standard for exosome isolation from cell cultures, no unique and standardized method for exosome isolation from distinct body fluids exists. The complexity, specific composition, and physical properties of each biofluid constitute a technical barrier to obtain reproducible and pure exosome preparations, demanding a detailed characterization of both exosome isolation and characterization methods. Moreover, some isolation procedures can affect downstream proteomic or RNA profiling analysis. This review compiles and discussed a set of comparative studies addressing distinct exosome isolation methods from human biofluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, serum, saliva, and urine, also focusing on body fluid specific challenges, physical properties, and other potential variation sources. This summarized information will facilitate the choice of exosome isolation methods, based on the type of biological samples available, and hopefully encourage the use of exosomes in translational and clinical research.",2023,Biofluids; Extracellular vesicles; Isolation methods,Humans; Exosomes; Proteomics; Ultracentrifugation; Body Fluids; Cell Culture Techniques,"Martins, TS; Vaz, M; Henriques, AG"

Investigation Covering the Effect of Boron plus Taurine Application on Protein Carbonyl and Advanced Oxidation Protein Products Levels in Experimental Alzheimer Model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that occurs in the brain. This is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which is valid in 60-70% of all dementia patients. Boron, regarded as a potential antioxidant, has the effect of reducing oxidative stress. Taurine, as one of the thiol-containing amino acids, exists at different concentrations in both the neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system. It plays an important role in the protective and adjuvant therapies as an antioxidant due to its characteristics of maintaining the oxidant-antioxidant balance of the body as well as cell integrity and increasing body resistance. Based on this information, our objective was to reveal the effect of boron alone, taurine alone plus co-administration of taurine and boron application on brain tissue protein carbonyls (PC) and serum advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels in the experimental Alzheimer's model. For this purpose, 5 groups were formed in our study which consisted of 30 Wistar albino male rats. The rats were given a single dose of STZ stereotaxically. At the end of this period, the rats were decapitated, plus their brain tissues and blood were removed. Our findings suggested that taurine alone and co-administration of boron and taurine had a decreasing effect on AOPP and PC levels of the experimental Alzheimer model of the rats.",2023,AOPP; Alzheimer’s disease; Boron; Protein carbonyls; Taurine,"Rats; Animals; Antioxidants; Taurine; Advanced Oxidation Protein Products; Rats, Wistar; Boron; Alzheimer Disease; Protein Carbonylation; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Oxidative Stress","Yildirim, C; Yar Saglam, AS; Guney, S; Turan, B; Ebegil, M; Coskun Cevher, S; Balabanli, B"

Association of functional connectivity of the executive control network or default mode network with cognitive impairment in older adults with remitted major depressive disorder or mild cognitive impairment.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. The present study aimed to better understand this risk by comparing resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in the executive control network (ECN) and the default mode network (DMN) in older adults with MDD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Additionally, we examined the association between rsFC in the ECN or DMN and cognitive impairment transdiagnostically. We assessed rsFC alterations in ECN and DMN in 383 participants from five groups at-risk for dementia-remitted MDD with normal cognition (MDD-NC), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), remitted MDD + naMCI, amnestic MCI (aMCI), and remitted MDD + aMCI-and from healthy controls (HC) or individuals with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Subject-specific whole-brain functional connectivity maps were generated for each network and group differences in rsFC were calculated. We hypothesized that alteration of rsFC in the ECN and DMN would be progressively larger among our seven groups, ranked from low to high according to their risk for dementia as HC, MDD-NC, naMCI, MDD + naMCI, aMCI, MDD + aMCI, and AD. We also regressed scores of six cognitive domains (executive functioning, processing speed, language, visuospatial memory, verbal memory, and working memory) on the ECN and DMN connectivity maps. We found a significant alteration in the rsFC of the ECN, with post hoc testing showing differences between the AD group and the HC, MDD-NC, or naMCI groups, but no significant alterations in rsFC of the DMN. Alterations in rsFC of the ECN and DMN were significantly associated with several cognitive domain scores transdiagnostically. Our findings suggest that a diagnosis of remitted MDD may not confer functional brain risk for dementia. However, given the association of rs-FC with cognitive performance (i.e., transdiagnostically), rs-FC may help in stratifying this risk among people with MDD and varying degrees of cognitive impairment.",2023,,"Humans; Aged; Depressive Disorder, Major; Executive Function; Default Mode Network; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease","Rashidi-Ranjbar, N; Rajji, TK; Hawco, C; Kumar, S; Herrmann, N; Mah, L; Flint, AJ; Fischer, CE; Butters, MA; Pollock, BG; Dickie, EW; Bowie, CR; Soffer, M; Mulsant, BH; Voineskos, AN"
Beyond its Psychiatric Use: The Benefits of Low-dose Lithium Supplementation.,"Lithium is most well-known for its mood-stabilizing effects in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Due to its narrow therapeutic window (0.5-1.2 mM serum concentration), there is a stigma associated with lithium treatment and the adverse effects that can occur at therapeutic doses. However, several studies have indicated that doses of lithium under the predetermined therapeutic dose used in bipolar disorder treatment may have beneficial effects not only in the brain but across the body. Currently, literature shows that low-dose lithium (≤0.5 mM) may be beneficial for cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, metabolic, and cognitive function, as well as inflammatory and antioxidant processes of the aging body. There is also some evidence of low-dose lithium exerting a similar and sometimes synergistic effect on these systems. This review summarizes these findings with a focus on low-dose lithium's potential benefits on the aging process and age-related diseases of these systems, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, obesity and type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and the chronic low-grade inflammatory state known as inflammaging. Although lithium's actions have been widely studied in the brain, the study of the potential benefits of lithium, particularly at a low dose, is still relatively novel. Therefore, this review aims to provide possible mechanistic insights for future research in this field.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cardiovascular disease; diabetes; inflammaging; obesity; osteoporosis; oxidative stress; sarcopenia,"Humans; Lithium; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; Dietary Supplements","Hamstra, SI; Roy, BD; Tiidus, P; MacNeil, AJ; Klentrou, P; MacPherson, REK; Fajardo, VA"
Association of α-1-Antichymotrypsin Expression with the Development of Conformational Changes of Tau Protein in Alzheimer's Disease Brain.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), two mutually exclusive amino-terminal-dependent conformations have been reported to occur during the aggregation of Tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). An early conformation of full-length Tau, involving the bending of the amino terminus over the third repeated domain, is recognized by the Alz-50 antibody, followed by a second conformation recognized by Tau-66 antibody that depends on the folding of the proline-rich region over the third repeated domain in a molecule partially truncated at the amino- and carboxyl-termini. α-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) is an acute phase serum glycoprotein that accumulates abnormally in the brain of AD patients, and since it is considered to promote the in vitro and in vivo aggregation of amyloid-β, we here seek further evidence that ACT may also contribute to the abnormal aggregation of Tau in AD. By analyzing brain samples from a population of AD cases under immunofluorescence and high-resolution confocal microscopy, we demonstrate here the abundant expression of ACT in hippocampal neurons, visualized as a granular diffuse accumulation, frequently reaching the nuclear compartment. In a significant number of these neurons, intracellular NFTs composed of abnormally phosphorylated and truncated Tau at Asp",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Tau conformation; immunofluorescence; neurofibrillary tangles; α-1-antichymotrypsin,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neurons; Brain; Antibodies,"Horta-López, PH; Mendoza-Franco, G; Rodríguez-Cruz, F; Torres-Cruz, FM; Hernández-Echeagaray, E; Jarero-Basulto, JJ; Rícny, J; Florán Garduño, B; Garcia-Sierra, F"
