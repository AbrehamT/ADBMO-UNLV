Clinically feasible automated MRI volumetry of the brain as a prognostic marker in subjective and mild cognitive impairment.,"The number of patients suffering from cognitive decline and dementia increases, and new possible treatments are being developed. Thus, the need for time efficient and cost-effective methods to facilitate an early diagnosis and prediction of future cognitive decline in patients with early cognitive symptoms is becoming increasingly important. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether an MRI based software, NeuroQuant® (NQ), producing volumetry of the hippocampus and whole brain volume (WBV) could predict: (1) conversion from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at baseline to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia at follow-up, and from MCI at baseline to dementia at follow-up and (2) progression of cognitive and functional decline defined as an annual increase in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Clinical Dementia Rating Scale; automated volumetry NeuroQuant®; dementia; disease progression; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment; subjective cognitive decline,,"Amland, R; Selbæk, G; Brækhus, A; Edwin, TH; Engedal, K; Knapskog, AB; Olsrud, ER; Persson, K"
Poststroke cognitive outcome is better accounted for by white matter abnormalities automated segmentation than visual analysis.,"The association between white matter abnormalities (WMA) and cognitive decline previously reported in poststroke patients has been mainly documented using visual scales. However, automated segmentation of WMA provides a precise determination of the volume of WMA. Nonetheless, it is rarely used in the stroke population and its potential advantage over visual scales is still unsettled. The objective of this study was to examine whether automated segmentation of WMA provides a better account than the visual Fazekas and Wahlund scales of the decline in executive functions and processing speed in stroke patients.",2024,Control functions; Dementia; Executive functions; Hemorrhage; Infarct; MRI; Mild cognitive impairment; Stroke; WMH,,"Lawson, B; Martin, J; Aarabi, A; Ouin, E; Tasseel-Ponche, S; Barbay, M; Andriuta, D; Roussel, M; Godefroy, O"
Extraction of sleep information from clinical notes of Alzheimer's disease patients using natural language processing.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. Sleep is one of the lifestyle-related factors that has been shown critical for optimal cognitive function in old age. However, there is a lack of research studying the association between sleep and AD incidence. A major bottleneck for conducting such research is that the traditional way to acquire sleep information is time-consuming, inefficient, non-scalable, and limited to patients' subjective experience. We aim to automate the extraction of specific sleep-related patterns, such as snoring, napping, poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, night wakings, other sleep problems, and sleep duration, from clinical notes of AD patients. These sleep patterns are hypothesized to play a role in the incidence of AD, providing insight into the relationship between sleep and AD onset and progression.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; clinical notes; electronic health records; information extraction; natural language processing; sleep,,"Sivarajkumar, S; Tam, TYC; Mohammad, HA; Viggiano, S; Oniani, D; Visweswaran, S; Wang, Y"

Evaluation of core Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in saliva and plasma measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays on a fully automated platform.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid peptide beta-42 (Aβ42), Aβ42/40 ratio, and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are precious tools for supporting AD diagnosis. However, their use in clinical practice is limited due to the invasiveness of CSF collection. Thus, there is intensive research to find alternative, noninvasive, and widely accessible biological matrices to measure AD core biomarkers. In this study, we measured AD core biomarkers in saliva and plasma by a fully automated platform. We enrolled all consecutive patients with cognitive decline. For each patient, we measured Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau levels in CSF, saliva, and plasma by Lumipulse G1200 (Fujirebio). We included forty-two patients, of whom 27 had AD. Levels of all biomarkers significantly differed in the three biofluids, with saliva having the lowest and CSF the highest levels of Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau. A positive correlation of pTau, Aβ42/40 ratio, and pTau/Aβ42 ratio levels in CSF and plasma was detected, while no correlation between any biomarker in CSF and saliva was found. Our findings suggest that plasma but not saliva could represent a surrogate biofluid for measuring core AD biomarkers. Specifically, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, pTau/Aβ42 ratio, and pTau could serve as surrogates of the corresponding CSF biomarkers.",2024,AD; Beta-amyloid; Biomarker; Fujirebio; Plasma; Saliva; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Saliva; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments; Luminescent Measurements; Aged, 80 and over","Agnello, L; Giglio, RV; Del Ben, F; Piccoli, T; Colletti, T; Scazzone, C; Lo Sasso, B; Ciaccio, AM; Gambino, CM; Salemi, G; Ciaccio, M"
Can white matter hyperintensities based Fazekas visual assessment scales inform about Alzheimer's disease pathology in the population?,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are considered hallmark features of cerebral small vessel disease and have recently been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Their distinct spatial distributions, namely periventricular versus deep WMH, may differ by underlying age-related and pathobiological processes contributing to cognitive decline. We aimed to identify the spatial patterns of WMH using the 4-scale Fazekas visual assessment and explore their differential association with age, vascular health, AD imaging markers, namely amyloid and tau burden, and cognition. Because our study consisted of scans from GE and Siemens scanners with different resolutions, we also investigated inter-scanner reproducibility and combinability of WMH measurements on imaging.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Deep white matter hyperintensity; Fazekas score; Periventricular white matter hyperintensity; White matter hyperintensities,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Aged, 80 and over; Positron-Emission Tomography; Reproducibility of Results; Middle Aged; tau Proteins; Brain","Pradeep, A; Raghavan, S; Przybelski, SA; Preboske, GM; Schwarz, CG; Lowe, VJ; Knopman, DS; Petersen, RC; Jack, CR; Graff-Radford, J; Cogswell, PM; Vemuri, P"
Assessing CT-based Volumetric Analysis via Transfer Learning with MRI and Manual Labels for Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"Brain computed tomography (CT) is an accessible and commonly utilized technique for assessing brain structure. In cases of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), the presence of ventriculomegaly is often neuroradiologically evaluated by visual rating and manually measuring each image. Previously, we have developed and tested a deep-learning-model that utilizes transfer learning from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CT-based intracranial tissue segmentation. Accordingly, herein we aimed to enhance the segmentation of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (VCSF) in brain CT scans and assess the performance of automated brain CT volumetrics in iNPH patient diagnostics.",2024,CNNs; CT; MRI; deep learning; hydrocephalus; volumetry,,"Srikrishna, M; Seo, W; Zettergren, A; Kern, S; Cantré, D; Gessler, F; Sotoudeh, H; Seidlitz, J; Bernstock, JD; Wahlund, LO; Westman, E; Skoog, I; Virhammar, J; Fällmar, D; Schöll, M"
Vision-based estimation of fatigue and engagement in cognitive training sessions.,"Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is a scalable, well-tolerated intervention that has promise for slowing cognitive decline. The effectiveness of CCT is often affected by a lack of effective engagement. Mental fatigue is a the primary factor for compromising effective engagement in CCT, particularly in older adults at risk for dementia. There is a need for scalable, automated measures that can constantly monitor and reliably detect mental fatigue during CCT. Here, we develop and validate a novel Recurrent Video Transformer (RVT) method for monitoring real-time mental fatigue in older adults with mild cognitive impairment using their video-recorded facial gestures during CCT. The RVT model achieved the highest balanced accuracy (79.58%) and precision (0.82) compared to the prior models for binary and multi-class classification of mental fatigue. We also validated our model by significantly relating to reaction time across CCT tasks (Waldχ",2024,Cognitive training; Computer vision; Disengagement; Facial gestures; Fatigue detection,,"Wang, Y; Turnbull, A; Xu, Y; Heffner, K; Lin, FV; Adeli, E"
An Overview of the ADReSS-M Signal Processing Grand Challenge on Multilingual Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition Through Spontaneous Speech.,"The ADReSS-M Signal Processing Grand Challenge was held at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2023. The challenge targeted difficult automatic prediction problems of great societal and medical relevance, namely, the detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and the estimation of cognitive test scoress. Participants were invited to create models for the assessment of cognitive function based on spontaneous speech data. Most of these models employed signal processing and machine learning methods. The ADReSS-M challenge was designed to assess the extent to which predictive models built based on speech in one language generalise to another language. The language data compiled and made available for ADReSS-M comprised English, for model training, and Greek, for model testing and validation. To the best of our knowledge no previous shared research task investigated acoustic features of the speech signal or linguistic characteristics in the context of multilingual AD detection. This paper describes the context of the ADReSS-M challenge, its data sets, its predictive tasks, the evaluation methodology we employed, our baseline models and results, and the top five submissions. The paper concludes with a summary discussion of the ADReSS-M results, and our critical assessment of the future outlook in this field.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomedical signal processing; human disease biomarkers; medical conditions; multilingual Alzheimer’s dementia detection; natural language processing; speech processing,,"Luz, S; Haider, F; Fromm, D; Lazarou, I; Kompatsiaris, I; Macwhinney, B"
Prolonged ventricular repolarization associated with mild cognitive impairment and white matter hyperintensities: a cross-sectional study.,"Prolonged ventricular repolarization has been associated with cardiovascular disease. We sought to investigate the association of prolonged ventricular repolarization with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the potential underlying neuropathological mechanisms in older adults. This cross-sectional study included 4328 dementia-free participants (age ≥ 65 years; 56.8% female) in the baseline examination of the Multidomain INterventions to delay dementia and Disability in rural China; of these, 989 undertook structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. QT, QTc, JT, JTc, and QRS intervals were derived from 12-lead electrocardiograph. MCI, amnestic MCI (aMCI), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) were defined following the Petersen's criteria. Volumes of gray matter (GM), white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, total white matter hyperintensities (WMH), periventricular WMH (PWMH), and deep WMH (DWMH) were automatically estimated. Data were analyzed using logistic and general linear regression models. Prolonged QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of MCI and aMCI, but not naMCI (p < 0.05). In the MRI subsample, QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals were significantly associated with larger total WMH and PWMH volumes (p < 0.05), but not with DWMH volume. Statistical interactions were detected, such that prolonged QT and JT intervals were significantly associated with reduced GM volume only among participants with coronary heart disease or without APOE ε4 allele (p < 0.05). Prolonged ventricular repolarization is associated with MCI and cerebral microvascular lesions in a general population of older adults. This underlies the importance of cognitive assessments and brain MRI examination among older adults with prolonged QT interval.",2024,Cross-sectional study; Electrocardiogram; Mild cognitive impairment; Prolonged ventricular repolarization; White matter hyperintensities,"Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Male; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Electrocardiography; Aged, 80 and over; Gray Matter; China","Mao, M; Wei, Y; Wang, C; Han, X; Liu, R; Dong, Y; Song, L; Cong, L; Wang, Y; Du, Y; Qiu, C"

Discrete Relationships between Spatiotemporal Gait Characteristics and Domain-Specific Neuropsychological Performance in Midlife.,"Midlife risk factors such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) confer a significantly increased risk of cognitive impairment in later life with executive function, memory, and attention domains often affected first. Spatiotemporal gait characteristics are emerging as important integrative biomarkers of neurocognitive function and of later dementia risk. We examined 24 spatiotemporal gait parameters across five domains of gait previously linked to cognitive function on usual-pace, maximal-pace, and cognitive dual-task gait conditions in 102 middle-aged adults with (57.5 ± 8.0 years; 40% female) and without (57.0 ± 8.3 years; 62.1% female) T2DM. Neurocognitive function was measured using a neuropsychological assessment battery. T2DM was associated with significant changes in gait phases and rhythm domains at usual pace, and greater gait variability observed during maximal pace and dual tasks. In the overall cohort, both the gait pace and rhythm domains were associated with memory and executive function during usual pace. At maximal pace, gait pace parameters were associated with reaction time and delayed memory. During the cognitive dual task, associations between gait variability and both delayed memory/executive function were observed. Associations persisted following covariate adjustment and did not differ by T2DM status. Principal components analysis identified a consistent association of slower gait pace (step/stride length) and increased gait variability during maximal-pace walking with poorer memory and executive function performance. These data support the use of spatiotemporal gait as an integrative biomarker of neurocognitive function in otherwise healthy middle-aged individuals and reveal discrete associations between both differing gait tasks and gait domains with domain-specific neuropsychological performance. Employing both maximal-pace and dual-task paradigms may be important in cognitively unimpaired populations with risk factors for later cognitive decline-with the aim of identifying individuals who may benefit from potential preventative interventions.",2024,automated walkway; cognition; cognitive impairment; dementia; dual task; gait; midlife; neuropsychological; type 2 diabetes,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Male; Gait; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Neuropsychological Tests; Executive Function; Cognition; Memory; Aged","Morrison, L; Dyer, AH; Dolphin, H; Killane, I; Bourke, NM; Widdowson, M; Woods, CP; Gibney, J; Reilly, RB; Kennelly, SP"

Residual-Based Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Computer-Aided Alzheimer's Disease Detection.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) poses a significant health risk globally, particularly among the elderly population. Recent studies underscore its prevalence, with over 50% of elderly Japanese facing a lifetime risk of dementia, primarily attributed to AD. As the most prevalent form of dementia, AD gradually erodes brain cells, leading to severe neurological decline. In this scenario, it is important to develop an automatic AD-detection system, and many researchers have been working to develop an AD-detection system by taking advantage of the advancement of deep learning (DL) techniques, which have shown promising results in various domains, including medical image analysis. However, existing approaches for AD detection often suffer from limited performance due to the complexities associated with training hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-stage deep neural network architecture based on residual functions to address the limitations of existing AD-detection approaches. Inspired by the success of residual networks (ResNets) in image-classification tasks, our proposed system comprises five stages, each explicitly formulated to enhance feature effectiveness while maintaining model depth. Following feature extraction, a deep learning-based feature-selection module is applied to mitigate overfitting, incorporating batch normalization, dropout and fully connected layers. Subsequently, machine learning (ML)-based classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and SoftMax, are employed for classification tasks. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T, MIRAID and OASIS Kaggle, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model. Impressively, our model achieves accuracy rates of 99.47%, 99.10% and 99.70% for ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T, MIRAID and OASIS datasets, respectively, outperforming existing systems in binary class problems. Our proposed model represents a significant advancement in the AD-analysis domain.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; CNN; Random Forest; machine learning; residual network,,"Hassan, N; Musa Miah, AS; Shin, J"
A Simple Sandwich Electrochemical Immunosensor for Rapid Detection of the Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Tau Protein.,"As a typical biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, rapid and specific detection of tau protein can help improve the early diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. In this study, a simple sandwich electrochemical immunosensor was developed for rapid detection of tau protein. Primary monoclonal antibodies (mAb1) against the middle domain of tau protein (amino acids 189-195) were immobilized on the gold electrode surface through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 3,3'-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP). Then the tau protein was captured through the specific adsorption between the antigen and the antibody, resulting in a change in the impedance. Secondary monoclonal antibodies (mAb2) against the N-terminal region of tau protein were used for further amplification of the binding reaction between mAb1 and tau protein. A linear correlation between the total change in impedance and the logarithm of tau concentration was found from 2 × 10",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); immunosensor; impedance; sandwich; tau protein,"tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Biosensing Techniques; Biomarkers; Electrochemical Techniques; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Gold; Immunoassay; Limit of Detection; Electrodes","Yang, M; Chen, Y; Sun, H; Li, D; Li, Y"
A novel insight into neurological disorders through HDAC6 protein-protein interactions.,"Due to its involvement in physiological and pathological processes, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is considered a promising pharmaceutical target for several neurological manifestations. However, the exact regulatory role of HDAC6 in the central nervous system (CNS) is still not fully understood. Hence, using a semi-automated literature screening technique, we systematically collected HDAC6-protein interactions that are experimentally validated and reported in the CNS. The resulting HDAC6 network encompassed 115 HDAC6-protein interactions divided over five subnetworks: (de)acetylation, phosphorylation, protein complexes, regulatory, and aggresome-autophagy subnetworks. In addition, 132 indirect interactions identified through HDAC6 inhibition were collected and categorized. Finally, to display the application of our HDAC6 network, we mapped transcriptomics data of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis on the network and highlighted that in the case of Alzheimer's disease, alterations predominantly affect the HDAC6 phosphorylation subnetwork, whereas differential expression within the deacetylation subnetwork is observed across all three neurological disorders. In conclusion, the HDAC6 network created in the present study is a novel and valuable resource for the understanding of the HDAC6 regulatory mechanisms, thereby providing a framework for the integration and interpretation of omics data from neurological disorders and pharmacodynamic assessments.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Central nervous system; Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6); Parkinson’s disease; Protein–protein interactions,Histone Deacetylase 6; Humans; Protein Interaction Maps; Nervous System Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphorylation; Acetylation; Parkinson Disease,"Bahram Sangani, N; Koetsier, J; Mélius, J; Kutmon, M; Ehrhart, F; Evelo, CT; Curfs, LMG; Reutelingsperger, CP; Eijssen, LMT"
A Telemedicine Analytic Framework for Fully and Semi-automatic Alzheimer's Disease Screening using Clock Drawing Test.,"More than 6 million Americans are at risk for Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD), most of whom are 65 or older. The clock drawing test (CDT) is a quick, simple, and effective technique that has the potential advantage of self-management and screening for ADRD patients. Current CDT-based ADRD screening studies focus more on efficacy, involving many handcrafted features, ignoring data modalities, and lacking validation. This paper aims to propose a unified telemedicine framework for fully and semi-automatic effective early ADRD screening based on multimodal and agile data fusion, focusing on the interpretability and validation of the model by using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and locally linear embedding (LLE). The datasets for this work include 1,662 samples of CDT images and related demographic and cognitive information. The fully automatic case involving only CDT images can achieve the highest AUC of 81% with a 75% recall rate in binary screening. The multimodal data fusion in the semi-automatic case can achieve up to 90% AUC with an 83% recall rate. The visualization of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) shows that it can automatically obtain critical information about the outline, scale, and clock hands from CDT images, and the analysis of structured features shows that the memory test is key to effective ADRD screening.",2024,,,"Bo, W; Sullivan, SS; Zhang, X; Gao, M; Xu, W"
Systematic review and meta-analysis of automated methods for quantifying enlarged perivascular spaces in the brain.,"Research into magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) has recently increased, as results from studies in different diseases and populations are cementing their association with sleep, disease phenotypes, and overall health indicators. With the establishment of worldwide consortia and the availability of large databases, computational methods that allow to automatically process all this wealth of information are becoming increasingly relevant. Several computational approaches have been proposed to assess PVS from MRI, and efforts have been made to summarise and appraise the most widely applied ones. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed all publications available up to September 2023 describing the development, improvement, or application of computational PVS quantification methods from MRI. We analysed 67 approaches and 60 applications of their implementation, from 112 publications. The two most widely applied were the use of a morphological filter to enhance PVS-like structures, with Frangi being the choice preferred by most, and the use of a U-Net configuration with or without residual connections. Older adults or population studies comprising adults from 18 years old onwards were, overall, more frequent than studies using clinical samples. PVS were mainly assessed from T2-weighted MRI acquired in 1.5T and/or 3T scanners, although combinations using it with T1-weighted and FLAIR images were also abundant. Common associations researched included age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, white matter hyperintensities, sleep and cognition, with occupation-related, ethnicity, and genetic/hereditable traits being also explored. Despite promising improvements to overcome barriers such as noise and differentiation from other confounds, a need for joined efforts for a wider testing and increasing availability of the most promising methods is now paramount.",2024,Automatic image segmentation; Cerebral small vessel disease; Cerebrovascular disease; Deep learning; Frangi filter; Image processing; Perivascular spaces; Systematic review; Thresholding; Virchow-Robin spaces,,"Waymont, JMJ; Valdés Hernández, MDC; Bernal, J; Duarte Coello, R; Brown, R; Chappell, FM; Ballerini, L; Wardlaw, JM"
Retina Fundus Photograph-Based Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Medicine: A Systematic Review.,"We conducted a systematic review of research in artificial intelligence (AI) for retinal fundus photographic images. We highlighted the use of various AI algorithms, including deep learning (DL) models, for application in ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic (i.e., systemic) disorders. We found that the use of AI algorithms for the interpretation of retinal images, compared to clinical data and physician experts, represents an innovative solution with demonstrated superior accuracy in identifying many ophthalmic (e.g., diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), optic nerve disorders), and non-ophthalmic disorders (e.g., dementia, cardiovascular disease). There has been a significant amount of clinical and imaging data for this research, leading to the potential incorporation of AI and DL for automated analysis.

The relationship between cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensities in mid to late life.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with cortical thinning. Although they are primarily detected in older participants, these lesions can appear in younger and midlife individuals. Here, we tested whether WMH are associated with cortical thinning in relatively younger (26-50 years) and relatively older (58-84) participants who were free of dementia, and how these associations are moderated by WMH localization. WMH were automatically quantified and categorized according to the localization of three classes of white matter tracts: association, commissural and projection fibers. Mediation analyses were used to infer whether differences in cortical thickness between younger and older participants were explained by WMH. Our results revealed that total WMH explained between 20.6 % and 65.5 % of the effect of age on cortical thickness in AD-signature regions including the lateral temporal lobes and supramarginal gyrus, among others. This mediation was slightly stronger for projection WMH, although it was still significant for association and commissural WMH. These results suggest that there is an interplay between vascular and AD causes of cognitive impairment that starts at younger ages.",2024,Cerebrovascular disease; Cognitive impairment; Cortical thickness; Neuroimaging; White matter hyperintensities,"Humans; White Matter; Aged; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Adult; Aging; Cerebral Cortex; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction","Jiménez-Balado, J; Habeck, C; Stern, Y; Eich, T"
The appropriate sample-handling procedure for measuring the plasma β-amyloid level using a fully automated immunoassay.,"Plasma β-amyloid (Aβ) assays are a promising tool for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in clinical practice. To obtain reliable results, establishing an appropriate sample-handling procedure for each analytical platform is warranted. This study proposes an appropriate sample-handling procedure using HISCL analyzer by elucidating the individual/combined effects of pre-analytical parameters on plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels. We investigated the effects of various pre-analytical parameters, including storage times for whole blood, plasma, and freezing conditions, on plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels, and confirmed if these values met the acceptable criteria. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels were acceptable in all conditions. We determined our protocol by confirming that plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels remained acceptable when combining pre-analytical parameters. We established an appropriate sample-handling protocol that ensures reliable measurement of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels using HISCL analyzer. We believe the Aβ assay, with our protocol, shows promise for aiding AD diagnosis in clinical settings.",2024,,Amyloid beta-Peptides; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Immunoassay; Peptide Fragments; Specimen Handling; Female; Male; Aged,"Ishiki, K; Yamashita, K; Watanabe, S; Miura, M; Kawahira, J; Arimatsu, Y; Kawasaki, K; Iwanaga, S; Sato, T"
A feature-aware multimodal framework with auto-fusion for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common dementias, has about 4.6 million new cases yearly worldwide. Due to the significant amount of suspected AD patients, early screening for the disease has become particularly important. There are diversified types of AD diagnosis data, such as cognitive tests, images, and risk factors, many prior investigations have primarily concentrated on integrating only high-dimensional features and simple fusion concatenation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes for AD diagnosis. Therefore, We propose an enhanced multimodal AD diagnostic framework comprising a feature-aware module and an automatic model fusion strategy (AMFS). To preserve the correlation and significance features within a low-dimensional space, the feature-aware module employs a low-dimensional SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) boosting feature selection as the initial step, following this analysis, diverse tiers of low-dimensional features are extracted from patients' biological data. Besides, in the high-dimensional stage, the feature-aware module integrates cross-modal attention mechanisms to capture subtle relationships among different cognitive domains, neuroimaging modalities, and risk factors. Subsequently, we integrate the aforementioned feature-aware module with graph convolutional networks (GCN) to address heterogeneous data in multimodal AD, while also possessing the capability to perceive relationships between different modalities. Lastly, our proposed AMFS autonomously learns optimal parameters for aligning two sub-models. The validation tests using two ADNI datasets show the high accuracies of 95.9% and 91.9% respectively, in AD diagnosis. The methods efficiently select features from multimodal AD data, optimizing model fusion for potential clinical assistance in diagnostics.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Attention mechanisms; Feature selection; Graph neural networks; Multimodal AD diagnosis,,"Zhang, M; Cui, Q; Lü, Y; Li, W"

Machine learning of dissection photographs and surface scanning for quantitative 3D neuropathology.,"We present open-source tools for three-dimensional (3D) analysis of photographs of dissected slices of human brains, which are routinely acquired in brain banks but seldom used for quantitative analysis. Our tools can: (1) 3D reconstruct a volume from the photographs and, optionally, a surface scan; and (2) produce a high-resolution 3D segmentation into 11 brain regions per hemisphere (22 in total), independently of the slice thickness. Our tools can be used as a substitute for ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which requires access to an MRI scanner, ex vivo scanning expertise, and considerable ﬁnancial resources.

AI-based mining of biomedical literature: Applications for drug repurposing for the treatment of dementia.,"Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and others significantly affect individuals, their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. While there are no cures yet, researchers worldwide are actively working on the development of novel treatments that have the potential to slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and ultimately improve the overall health of patients. Huge volumes of new scientific information necessitate new analytical approaches for meaningful hypothesis generation. To enable the automatic analysis of biomedical data we introduced AGATHA, an effective AI-based literature mining tool that can navigate massive scientific literature databases, such as PubMed. The overarching goal of this effort is to adapt AGATHA for drug repurposing by revealing hidden connections between FDA-approved medications and a health condition of interest. Our tool converts the abstracts of peer-reviewed papers from PubMed into multidimensional space where each gene and health condition are represented by specific metrics. We implemented advanced statistical analysis to reveal distinct clusters of scientific terms within the virtual space created using AGATHA-calculated parameters for selected health conditions and genes. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was employed for categorizing and predicting samples (122 diseases and 20889 genes) fitted to specific classes. Advanced statistics were employed to build a discrimination model and extract lists of genes specific to each disease class. Here we focus on drugs that can be repurposed for dementia treatment as an outcome of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we determined dementia-associated genes statistically highly ranked in other disease classes. Additionally, we report a mechanism for detecting genes common to multiple health conditions. These sets of genes were classified based on their presence in biological pathways, aiding in selecting candidates and biological processes that are exploitable with drug repurposing.",2024,,,"Sikirzhytskaya, A; Tyagin, I; Sutton, SS; Wyatt, MD; Safro, I; Shtutman, M"

Multimodal deep learning for dementia classification using text and audio.,"Dementia is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the daily lives of older adults, impacting their verbal communication and cognitive function. Early diagnosis is important to enhance the lifespan and quality of life for affected individuals. Despite its importance, diagnosing dementia is a complex process. Automated machine learning solutions involving multiple types of data have the potential to improve the process of automated dementia screening. In this study, we build deep learning models to classify dementia cases from controls using the Pitt Cookie Theft dataset from DementiaBank, a database of short participant responses to the structured task of describing a picture of a cookie theft. We fine-tune Wav2vec and Word2vec baseline models to make binary predictions of dementia from audio recordings and text transcripts, respectively. We conduct experiments with four versions of the dataset: (1) the original data, (2) the data with short sentences removed, (3) text-based augmentation of the original data, and (4) text-based augmentation of the data with short sentences removed. Our results indicate that synonym-based text data augmentation generally enhances the performance of models that incorporate the text modality. Without data augmentation, models using the text modality achieve around 60% accuracy and 70% AUROC scores, and with data augmentation, the models achieve around 80% accuracy and 90% AUROC scores. We do not observe significant improvements in performance with the addition of audio or timestamp information into the model. We include a qualitative error analysis of the sentences that are misclassified under each study condition. This study provides preliminary insights into the effects of both text-based data augmentation and multimodal deep learning for automated dementia classification.",2024,,"Humans; Deep Learning; Dementia; Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Databases, Factual","Lin, K; Washington, PY"

Advancing surgical instrument safety: A screen of oxidative and alkaline prion decontaminants using real-time quaking-induced conversion with prion-coated steel beads as surgical instrument mimetic.,"Iatrogenic transmission of prions, the infectious agents of fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, through inefficiently decontaminated medical instruments remains a critical issue. Harsh chemical treatments are effective, but not suited for routine reprocessing of reusable surgical instruments in medical cleaning and disinfection processes due to material incompatibilities. The identification of mild detergents with activity against prions is therefore of high interest but laborious due to the low throughput of traditional assays measuring prion infectivity. Here, we report the establishment of TESSA (sTainlESs steel-bead Seed Amplification assay), a modified real-time quaking induced cyclic amplification (RT-QuIC) assay that explores the propagation activity of prions with stainless steel beads. TESSA was applied for the screening of about 70 different commercially available and novel formulations and conditions for their prion inactivation efficacy. One hypochlorite-based formulation, two commercially available alkaline formulations and a manual alkaline pre-cleaner were found to be highly effective in inactivating prions under conditions simulating automated washer-disinfector cleaning processes. The efficacy of these formulations was confirmed in vivo in a murine prion infectivity bioassay, yielding a reduction of the prion titer for bead surface adsorbed prions below detectability. Our data suggest that TESSA represents an effective method for a rapid screening of prion-inactivating detergents, and that alkaline and oxidative formulations are promising in reducing the risk of potential iatrogenic prion transmission through insufficiently decontaminated instrument surfaces.",2024,,Animals; Surgical Instruments; Mice; Prions; Stainless Steel; Decontamination; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Disinfection; Detergents; Humans; Disinfectants; Oxidation-Reduction,"Heinzer, D; Avar, M; Pfammatter, M; Moos, R; Schwarz, P; Buhmann, MT; Kuhn, B; Mauerhofer, S; Rosenberg, U; Aguzzi, A; Hornemann, S"

Automated free speech analysis reveals distinct markers of Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.,"Dementia can disrupt how people experience and describe events as well as their own role in them. Alzheimer's disease (AD) compromises the processing of entities expressed by nouns, while behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) entails a depersonalized perspective with increased third-person references. Yet, no study has examined whether these patterns can be captured in connected speech via natural language processing tools. To tackle such gaps, we asked 96 participants (32 AD patients, 32 bvFTD patients, 32 healthy controls) to narrate a typical day of their lives and calculated the proportion of nouns, verbs, and first- or third-person markers (via part-of-speech and morphological tagging). We also extracted objective properties (frequency, phonological neighborhood, length, semantic variability) from each content word. In our main study (with 21 AD patients, 21 bvFTD patients, and 21 healthy controls), we used inferential statistics and machine learning for group-level and subject-level discrimination. The above linguistic features were correlated with patients' scores in tests of general cognitive status and executive functions. We found that, compared with HCs, (i) AD (but not bvFTD) patients produced significantly fewer nouns, (ii) bvFTD (but not AD) patients used significantly more third-person markers, and (iii) both patient groups produced more frequent words. Machine learning analyses showed that these features identified individuals with AD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.71). A generalizability test, with a model trained on the entire main study sample and tested on hold-out samples (11 AD patients, 11 bvFTD patients, 11 healthy controls), showed even better performance, with AUCs of 0.76 and 0.83 for AD and bvFTD, respectively. No linguistic feature was significantly correlated with cognitive test scores in either patient group. These results suggest that specific cognitive traits of each disorder can be captured automatically in connected speech, favoring interpretability for enhanced syndrome characterization, diagnosis, and monitoring.",2024,,Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; Speech; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Biomarkers; Natural Language Processing; Machine Learning; Neuropsychological Tests; Executive Function,"Lopes da Cunha, P; Ruiz, F; Ferrante, F; Sterpin, LF; Ibáñez, A; Slachevsky, A; Matallana, D; Martínez, Á; Hesse, E; García, AM"

Biomarker Identification for Gender Specificity of Alzheimer's Disease Based on the Glial Transcriptome Profiles.,"Many sex-specific biomarkers have been recently revealed in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, cerebral glial cells were rarely reported. This study analyzed 220,095 single-nuclei transcriptomes from the frontal cortex of thirty-three AD individuals in the GEO database. Sex-specific Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified in glial cells, including 243 in astrocytes, 1,154 in microglia, and 572 in oligodendrocytes. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation analyses and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed functional concentration in synaptic, neural, and hormone-related pathways. Protein-protein interaction network (PPI) identified MT3, CALM2, DLG2, KCND2, PAKACB, CAMK2D, and NLGN4Y in astrocytes, TREM2, FOS, APOE, APP, and NLGN4Y in microglia, and GRIN2A, ITPR2, GNAS, and NLGN4Y in oligodendrocytes as key genes. NLGN4Y was the only gene shared by the three glia and was identified as the biomarker for the gender specificity of AD. Gene-transcription factor (TF)-miRNA coregulatory network identified key regulators for NLGN4Y and its target TCMs. Ecklonia kurome Okam (Kunbu) and Herba Ephedrae (Mahuang) were identified, and the effects of the active ingredients on AD were displayed. Finally, enrichment analysis of Kunbu and Mahuang suggested that they might act as therapeutic candidates for gender specificity of AD.",2024,,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Transcriptome; Female; Neuroglia; Male; Biomarkers,"Liu, H; Yang, H; Liu, S; Li, S; Yang, W; Ayesha, A; Tan, X; Jiang, C; Liu, Y; Xie, L"
Multimodal cross-examination of progressive apraxia of speech by diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography and Tau-PET scans.,"Progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS) is a 4R tauopathy characterized by difficulties with motor speech planning. Neurodegeneration in PAOS targets the premotor cortex, particularly the supplementary motor area (SMA), with degeneration of white matter (WM) tracts connecting premotor and motor cortices and Broca's area observed on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We aimed to assess flortaucipir uptake across speech-language-related WM tracts identified using DTI tractography in PAOS. Twenty-two patients with PAOS and 26 matched healthy controls were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group (NRG) and underwent MRI and flortaucipir-PET. The patient population included patients with primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) and non-fluent variant/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia (agPPA). Flortaucipir PET scans and DTI were coregistered using rigid registration with a mutual information cost function in subject space. Alignments between DTI and flortaucipir PET were inspected in all cases. Whole-brain tractography was calculated using deterministic algorithms by a tractography reconstruction tool (DSI-studio) and specific tracts were identified using an automatic fiber tracking atlas-based method. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were averaged across the frontal aslant tract, arcuate fasciculi, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculi, as well as the SMA commissural fibers. Reduced FA (p < .0001) and elevated flortaucipir SUVR (p = .0012) were observed in PAOS cases compared to controls across all combined WM tracts. For flortaucipir SUVR, the greatest differentiation of PAOS from controls was achieved with the SMA commissural fibers (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.83), followed by the left arcuate fasciculus (AUROC = 0.75) and left frontal aslant tract (AUROC = 0.71). Our findings demonstrate that flortaucipir uptake is increased across WM tracts related to speech/language difficulties in PAOS.",2024,Tau; TauPET; diffusion tensor imaging; flortaucipir; positron emission tomography; progressive apraxia of speech; tractography,"Humans; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Male; Female; Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Middle Aged; Carbolines; Multimodal Imaging; Apraxias; White Matter; tau Proteins; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Brain","Gatto, RG; Pham, NTT; Duffy, JR; Clark, HM; Utianski, RL; Botha, H; Machulda, MM; Lowe, VJ; Schwarz, CG; Jack, CR; Josephs, KA; Whitwell, JL"

A multimodal machine learning model for predicting dementia conversion in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60-70% of the population with dementia. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a diagnostic entity defined as an intermediate stage between subjective cognitive decline and dementia, and about 10-15% of people annually convert to AD. We aimed to investigate the most robust model and modality combination by combining multi-modality image features based on demographic characteristics in six machine learning models. A total of 196 subjects were enrolled from four hospitals and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. During the four-year follow-up period, 47 (24%) patients progressed from MCI to AD. Volumes of the regions of interest, white matter hyperintensity, and regional Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) were analyzed using T1, T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRIs, and amyloid PET (αPET), along with automatically provided hippocampal occupancy scores (HOC) and Fazekas scales. As a result of testing the robustness of the model, the GBM model was the most stable, and in modality combination, model performance was further improved in the absence of T2-FLAIR image features.

Actual Clinical Practice Assessment: A Rapid and Easy-to-Use Tool for Evaluating Cognitive Decline Equivalent to Dementia.,"Background Screening tests reveal the early signs of cognitive decline, enabling better self-care and preparation for the future. We developed and evaluated the accuracy of a rapid (20 s) and easy-to-use tool called ONSEI, assessing the cognitive decline equivalent to dementia in actual clinical practice by correlating clinical diagnoses with the ONSEI classification. Methods In this retrospective observational study, data were collected from individuals who visited three neurosurgical clinics in neighboring prefectures of Tokyo, Japan. ONSEI analysis was performed using a smartphone or tablet. The tool adopts a machine-learning algorithm using the speaker's age, time-orientation task score, and acoustic features of spoken responses to that task. Significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated by Fisher's exact test. Results The overall classification accuracy of ONSEI was 98.1% (p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 97.3% (p<0.001) and 98.5% (p<0.001), respectively. The proportion of correct classifications was consistent across different age groups. Conclusion ONSEI showed high classification accuracy for dementia in cognitively normal individuals in actual clinical practice, regardless of the facility at which the tests were conducted or the age of the participants.

Assessment of memory deficits in psychiatric disorders: A systematic literature review.,"Memory deficits are observed across psychiatric disorders ranging from the prodrome of psychosis to common mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and dissociative disorders. Memory deficits among patients recovering from psychiatric disorders could be directly related to the primary illness or secondary to the adverse effect of a treatment such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). The trouble in the meaningful integration of working-memory and episodic memory is the most commonly affected domain that requires routine assessments. An update on the recent trends of methods of assessment of memory deficits is the first step towards understanding and correcting these deficits to target optimum recovery. A systematic literature search was conducted from October 2018 to October 2022 to review the recent methods of assessment of memory deficits in psychiatric disorders. The definition of 'Memory deficit' was operationalized as 'selective processes of memory, commonly required for activities of daily living, and affected among psychiatric disorders resulting in subjective distress and dysfunction'. We included 110 studies, most of them being conducted in western countries on patients with schizophrenia. Other disorders included dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery, California Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test Part A and B, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Wechsler Memory Scale, Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale-IV were the most common neuropsychological assessments used. Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment were the most common bedside assessment tools used while Squire Subjective Memory Questionnaire was commonly used to measure ECT-related memory deficits. The review highlights the recent developments in the field of assessment of memory deficits in psychiatric disorders. Findings recommend and emphasize routine assessment of memory deficits among psychiatric disorders in developing countries especially severe mental illnesses. It remains interesting to see the role of standardized assessments in diagnostic systems given more than a decade of research on memory deficits in psychiatric disorders.",2024,Assessment; Cognitive; Memory deficits; Neuropsychological assessment; Recent memory; Working memory; psychiatry,,"Kushwaha, A; Basera, DS; Kumari, S; Sutar, RF; Singh, V; Das, S; Agrawal, A"
Automatic offline-capable smartphone paper-based microfluidic device for efficient biomarker detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment. Efficient and rapid detection plays a crucial role in mitigating and managing AD progression. Deep learning-assisted smartphone-based microfluidic paper analysis devices (μPADs) offer the advantages of low cost, good sensitivity, and rapid detection, providing a strategic pathway to address large-scale disease screening in resource-limited areas. However, existing smartphone-based detection platforms usually rely on large devices or cloud servers for data transfer and processing. Additionally, the implementation of automated colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassay (c-ELISA) on μPADs can further facilitate the realization of smartphone μPADs platforms for efficient disease detection.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassay (c-ELISA); Deep learning; Microfluidic paper analysis devices (μPADs); Offline; Smartphone,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Smartphone; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Paper; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Peptide Fragments; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Deep Learning; Automation; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques,"Duan, S; Cai, T; Liu, F; Li, Y; Yuan, H; Yuan, W; Huang, K; Hoettges, K; Chen, M; Lim, EG; Zhao, C; Song, P"
Using principal component analysis to determine which vestibular stimuli provide best biomarkers for separating Alzheimer's from mixed Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often mixed with cerebrovascular disease (AD-CVD). Heterogeneity of dementia etiology and the overlapping of neuropathological features of AD and AD-CVD make feature identification of the two challenging. Separation of AD from AD-CVD is important as the optimized treatment for each group may differ. Recent studies using vestibular responses recorded from electrovestibulography (EVestG™) have offered promising results for separating these two pathologies. An EVestG measurement records responses to several different physical stimuli (called tilts). In previous research, the number of EVestG features from different tilts was selected based on physiological intuition to classify AD from AD-CVD. As the number of potential characteristic features from all tilts can be very large, in this study, we used an algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) to rank the most effective vestibular stimuli for differentiating AD from AD-CVD. Analyses were performed on the EVestG signals of 28 individuals with AD and 24 with AD-CVD. The results of this study showed that tilts simulating the otolithic organs (utricle and saccule) generated the most characteristic features for separating AD from AD-CVD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Automated tilt selection; Cerebrovascular symptomatology; Electrovestibulography; Principal component analysis (PCA),,"Marzban, S; Dastgheib, Z; Lithgow, B; Moussavi, Z"
Robot-based solution for helping Alzheimer patients.,"Alzheimer's is a progressive and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired daily functioning. It is an irreversible brain disease that destroys memory, thinking, and the ability to carry out daily activities. It poses significant challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Modern societies are trying to enhance the quality of people's lives, including Alzheimer's patients. In this study, we explored the potential of social robots to provide emotional support, improve cognitive function, and facilitate communication among Alzheimer's patients. This was achieved by initiating conversations on various topics such as family, relationships, and daily activities. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing a novel and well-organized framework for building an Alzheimer's care robot. Further, this study enriches the literature by introducing the Alzheimer Care Companion Robot (ACCR), designed to identify Alzheimer's patients. The ACCR initiates conversations in the native Arab-Kuwaiti dialect, displaying relevant memories through images and videos on its screen to assist in memory recall based on the individuals' life experiences. The proposed ACCR consists of 271 conversations belonging to three main categories: active, proactive, and graphical user interface (GUI) dialogs comprising 112 dialogs, 109 dialogs, and 50 dialogs for active, proactive, and GUI, respectively.

Genetic-based patient stratification in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows a high pathological and symptomatological heterogeneity. To study this heterogeneity, we have developed a patient stratification technique based on one of the most significant risk factors for the development of AD: genetics. We addressed this challenge by including network biology concepts, mapping genetic variants data into a brain-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and obtaining individualized PPI scores that we then used as input for a clustering technique. We then phenotyped each obtained cluster regarding genetics, sociodemographics, biomarkers, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, and neurocognitive assessments. We found three clusters defined mainly by genetic variants found in MAPT, APP, and APOE, considering known variants associated with AD and other neurodegenerative disease genetic architectures. Profiling of these clusters revealed minimal variation in AD symptoms and pathology, suggesting different biological mechanisms may activate the neurodegeneration and pathobiological patterns behind AD and result in similar clinical and pathological presentations, even a shared disease diagnosis. Lastly, our research highlighted MAPT, APP, and APOE as key genes where these genetic distinctions manifest, suggesting them as potential targets for personalized drug development strategies to address each AD subgroup individually.",2024,,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; tau Proteins; Apolipoproteins E; Positron-Emission Tomography; Male; Female; Aged; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Protein Interaction Maps; Biomarkers; Brain,"Hernández-Lorenzo, L; García-Gutiérrez, F; Solbas-Casajús, A; Corrochano, S; Matías-Guiu, JA; Ayala, JL"

Is the Invisibility of Dementia a Super-Power or a Curse? A Reflection on the SUNshiners' Questionnaire into the Public Understanding of Dementia as an Invisible Disability: A User-Led Research Project.,"The SUNshiners group includes people in the early stages of dementia with an interest in dementia activism and research. The group found that despite the growing awareness of invisible disabilities, there is very limited research into the pros and cons of the invisibility of dementia. Our paper explores the SUNshiners research which stemmed from varied individual experiences of disclosing diagnoses. The group designed and developed a short survey to explore what the public knew about dementia and what they thought about the invisibility of dementia. A mixture of open- and closed-ended questions were used to gain meaningful data. A total of 347 people completed the survey (315 online and 32 paper-based), which was then co-analysed. The findings suggest that the majority of the public felt that the invisibility of dementia was negative; that knowing someone had dementia when first meeting them would be beneficial; that people living with dementia should maintain the right to vote; and that people living with dementia do not automatically require a consistent, regular carer. Common themes from the open-ended answers included capacity, severity of dementia, and access to support. The findings support the disclosure of dementia diagnosis; however, more action is needed to tackle stigmatised views, particularly as the SUNshiners felt that people do not have enough dementia education to support a positive disclosure experience. They shared their experiences of the group and the project's benefits, but also the losses they have faced.

External evaluation of a deep learning-based approach for automated brain volumetry in patients with huntington's disease.,"A crucial step in the clinical adaptation of an AI-based tool is an external, independent validation. The aim of this study was to investigate brain atrophy in patients with confirmed, progressed Huntington's disease using a certified software for automated volumetry and to compare the results with the manual measurement methods used in clinical practice as well as volume calculations of the caudate nuclei based on manual segmentations. Twenty-two patients were included retrospectively, consisting of eleven patients with Huntington's disease and caudate nucleus atrophy and an age- and sex-matched control group. To quantify caudate head atrophy, the frontal horn width to intercaudate distance ratio and the intercaudate distance to inner table width ratio were obtained. The software mdbrain was used for automated volumetry. Manually measured ratios and automatically measured volumes of the groups were compared using two-sample t-tests. Pearson correlation analyses were performed. The relative difference between automatically and manually determined volumes of the caudate nuclei was calculated. Both ratios were significantly different between the groups. The automatically and manually determined volumes of the caudate nuclei showed a high level of agreement with a mean relative discrepancy of - 2.3 ± 5.5%. The Huntington's disease group showed significantly lower volumes in a variety of supratentorial brain structures. The highest degree of atrophy was shown for the caudate nucleus, putamen, and pallidum (all p < .0001). The caudate nucleus volume and the ratios were found to be strongly correlated in both groups. In conclusion, in patients with progressed Huntington's disease, it was shown that the automatically determined caudate nucleus volume correlates strongly with measured ratios commonly used in clinical practice. Both methods allowed clear differentiation between groups in this collective. The software additionally allows radiologists to more objectively assess the involvement of a variety of brain structures that are less accessible to standard semiquantitative methods.",2024,,"Humans; Huntington Disease; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Deep Learning; Caudate Nucleus; Retrospective Studies; Brain; Atrophy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Adult; Aged; Software; Organ Size; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Haase, R; Lehnen, NC; Schmeel, FC; Deike, K; Rüber, T; Radbruch, A; Paech, D"
Fiber-in-tube SPME-CapLC-MS/MS method to determine Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from Alzheimer's patients.,"Mass spectrometry is characterized by its high sensitivity, ability to measure very low analyte concentrations, specificity to distinguish between closely related compounds, availability to generate high-throughput methods for screening, and high multiplexing capacity. This technique has been used as a platform to analyze fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.

Capacity for the management of kidney failure in the International Society of Nephrology Western Europe region: report from the 2023 ISN Global Kidney Health Atlas (ISN-GKHA).,"Western Europe boasts advanced health care systems, robust kidney care guidelines, and a well-established health care workforce. Despite this, significant disparities in kidney replacement therapy incidence, prevalence, and transplant access exist. This paper presents the third International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas's findings on kidney care availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality in 22 Western European countries, representing 99% of the region's population. The known chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence across Western Europe averages 10.6%, slightly above the global median. Cardiovascular diseases account for a substantial portion of CKD-related deaths. Kidney failure incidence varies. Government health expenditure differs; however, most countries offer government-funded acute kidney injury, dialysis, and kidney transplantation care. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are universally available, with variations in the number of dialysis centers. Kidney transplantation is available in all countries (except for 3 microstates), with variable transplant center prevalence. Conservative kidney management (CKM) is increasingly accessible. The region's kidney care workforce is substantial, exceeding global averages; however, workforce shortages are reported. Barriers to optimal kidney care include limited workforce capacity, lack of surveillance mechanisms, and suboptimal integration into national noncommunicable disease (NCD) strategies. Policy recognition of CKD as a health priority varies across countries. Although Western Europe exhibits strong kidney care infrastructure, opportunities for improvement exist, particularly in CKD prevention, surveillance, awareness, and policy implementation. Efforts to improve CKD care should include automated detection, educational support, and enhanced workflows.

"Structural neuroimaging markers of normal pressure hydrocephalus versus Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease, and hydrocephalus versus atrophy in chronic TBI-a narrative review.","Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) is a prominent type of reversible dementia that may be treated with shunt surgery, and it is crucial to differentiate it from irreversible degeneration caused by its symptomatic mimics like Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Similarly, it is important to distinguish between (normal pressure) hydrocephalus and irreversible atrophy/degeneration which are among the chronic effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (cTBI), as the former may be reversed through shunt placement. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the structural imaging markers which may be foundational to the development of accurate, noninvasive, and accessible solutions to this problem.",2024,Alzheimer’s dementia; Parkinson’s disease; chronic traumatic brain injury; computational methods; normal pressure hydrocephalus; structural imaging,,"Kadaba Sridhar, S; Dysterheft Robb, J; Gupta, R; Cheong, S; Kuang, R; Samadani, U"
"Performance Evaluation of Deep, Shallow and Ensemble Machine Learning Methods for the Automated Classification of Alzheimer's Disease.","Artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches are crucial in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for various medical applications. Their ability to quickly and accurately learn from complex data is remarkable. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promising results in accurately classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its related cognitive states, Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), along with the healthy conditions known as Cognitively Normal (CN). This offers valuable insights into disease progression and diagnosis. However, certain traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers perform equally well or even better than DL models, requiring less training data. This is particularly valuable in CAD in situations with limited labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose an ensemble classifier based on ML models for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.52%. This represents a 3-5% improvement over the best individual classifier. We evaluated popular ML classifiers for AD classification under both data-scarce and data-rich conditions using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies datasets. By comparing the results to state-of-the-art CNN-centric DL algorithms, we gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This work will help users to select the most suitable algorithm for AD classification based on data availability.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; classification; deep learning; ensemble learning; machine learning,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Deep Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Machine Learning; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuroimaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Algorithms","Shaffi, N; Subramanian, K; Vimbi, V; Hajamohideen, F; Abdesselam, A; Mahmud, M"

Towards a multimodal neuroimaging-based risk score for mild cognitive impairment by combining clinical studies with a large (N>37000) population-based study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia, leading to a decline in memory, reasoning, and social skills. While numerous studies have investigated the genetic risk factors associated with AD, less attention has been given to identifying a brain imaging-based measure of AD risk. This study introduces a novel approach to assess mild cognitive impairment MCI, as a stage before AD, risk using neuroimaging data, referred to as a brain-wide risk score (BRS), which incorporates multimodal brain imaging. To begin, we first categorized participants from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)-3 cohort into two groups: controls (CN) and individuals with MCI. Next, we computed structure and functional imaging features from all the OASIS data as well as all the UK Biobank data. For resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we computed functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices using fully automated spatially constrained independent component analysis. For structural MRI data we computed gray matter (GM) segmentation maps. We then evaluated the similarity between each participant's neuroimaging features from the UK Biobank and the difference in the average of those features between CN individuals and those with MCI, which we refer to as the brain-wide risk score (BRS). Both GM and FNC features were utilized in determining the BRS. We first evaluated the differences in the distribution of the BRS for CN vs MCI within the OASIS-3 (using OASIS-3 as the reference group). Next, we evaluated the BRS in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (using OASIS-3 as the reference group), showing that the BRS can differentiate MCI from CN in an independent data set. Subsequently, using the sMRI BRS, we identified 10 distinct subgroups and similarly, we identified another set of 10 subgroups using the FNC BRS. For sMRI and FNC we observed results that mutually validate each other, with certain aspects being complementary. For the unimodal analysis, sMRI provides greater differentiation between MCI and CN individuals than the fMRI data, consistent with prior work. Additionally, by utilizing a multimodal BRS approach, which combines both GM and FNC assessments, we identified two groups of subjects using the multimodal BRS scores. One group exhibits high MCI risk with both negative GM and FNC BRS, while the other shows low MCI risk with both positive GM and FNC BRS. Moreover, in the UKBB we have 46 participants diagnosed with AD showed FNC and GM patterns similar to those in high-risk groups, defined in both unimodal and multimodal BRS. Finally, to ensure the reproducibility of our findings, we conducted a validation analysis using the ADNI as an additional reference dataset and repeated the above analysis. The results were consistently replicated across different reference groups, highlighting the potential of FNC and sMRI-based BRS in early Alzheimer's detection.",2024,Mild cognitive impairment; brain risk score; functional network connectivity; gray matter; multimodal neuroimaging,,"Zendehrouh, E; Sendi, MSE; Abrol, A; Batta, I; Hassanzadeh, R; Calhoun, VD"
Can white matter hyperintensities based Fazekas visual assessment scales inform about Alzheimer's disease pathology in the population?,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are considered hallmark features of cerebral small vessel disease and have recently been linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Their distinct spatial distributions, namely periventricular versus deep WMH, may differ by underlying age-related and pathobiological processes contributing to cognitive decline. We aimed to identify the spatial patterns of WMH using the 4-scale Fazekas visual assessment and explore their differential association with age, vascular health, Alzheimer's imaging markers, namely amyloid and tau burden, and cognition. Because our study consisted of scans from GE and Siemens scanners with different resolutions, we also investigated inter-scanner reproducibility and combinability of WMH measurements on imaging.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Fazekas score; deep white matter hyperintensity; periventricular white matter hyperintensity; white matter hyperintensities,,"Pradeep, A; Raghavan, S; Przybelski, SA; Preboske, G; Schwarz, CG; Lowe, VJ; Knopman, DS; Petersen, RC; Jack, CR; Graff-Radford, J; Cogswell, PM; Vemuri, P"

Evaluating Technicians' Workload and Performance in Diagnosis for Corrective Maintenance.,"The advancement in digital technology is transforming the world. It enables smart product-service systems that improve productivity by changing tasks, processes, and the ways we work. There are great opportunities in maintenance because many tasks require physical and cognitive work, but are still carried out manually. However, the interaction between a human and a smart system is inevitable, since not all tasks in maintenance can be fully automated. Therefore, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment to investigate the impact on technicians' workload and performance due to the introduction of smart technology. Especially, we focused on the effects of different diagnosis support systems on technicians during maintenance activity. We experimented with a model that replicates the key components of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine with a proximity sensor, a component that requires frequent maintenance. Forty-five participants were evenly assigned to three groups: a group that used a Fault-Tree diagnosis support system (FTd-system), a group that used an artificial intelligence diagnosis support system (AId-system), and a group that used neither of the diagnosis support systems. The results show that the group that used the FTd-system completed the task 15% faster than the group that used the AId-system. There was no significant difference in the workload between groups. Further analysis using the NGOMSL model implied that the difference in time to complete was probably due to the difference in system interfaces. In summary, the experimental results and further analysis imply that adopting the new diagnosis support system may improve maintenance productivity by reducing the number of diagnosis attempts without burdening technicians with new workloads. Estimates indicate that the maintenance time and the cognitive load can be reduced by 8.4 s and 15% if only two options are shown in the user interface.",2024,diagnosis support system; human–smart system interface; maintenance,Humans; Workload; Artificial Intelligence; Frontotemporal Dementia; Technology; User-Computer Interface,"Shin, H; Rothrock, L; Prabhu, V"
The Chronic Effects of a Single Low-Intensity Blast Exposure on Phosphoproteome Networks and Cognitive Function Influenced by Mutant Tau Overexpression.,"Blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) is a pressing concern for veterans and civilians exposed to explosive devices. Affected personnel may have increased risk for long-term cognitive decline and developing tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease-related disorders (ADRD) or frontal-temporal dementia (FTD). The goal of this study was to identify the effect of BINT on molecular networks and their modulation by mutant tau in transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing the human tau P301L mutation (rTg4510) linked to FTD or non-carriers. The primary focus was on the phosphoproteome because of the prominent role of hyperphosphorylation in neurological disorders. Discrimination learning was assessed following injury in the subsequent 6 weeks, using the automated home-cage monitoring CognitionWall platform. At 40 days post injury, label-free phosphoproteomics was used to evaluate molecular networks in the frontal cortex of mice. Utilizing a weighted peptide co-expression network analysis (WpCNA) approach, we identified phosphopeptide networks tied to associative learning and mossy-fiber pathways and those which predicted learning outcomes. Phosphorylation levels in these networks were inversely related to learning and linked to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive decline, and dementia including Atp6v1a and Itsn1. Low-intensity blast (LIB) selectively increased pSer262tau in rTg4510, a site implicated in initiating tauopathy. Additionally, individual and group level analyses identified the Arhgap33 phosphopeptide as an indicator of BINT-induced cognitive impairment predominantly in rTg4510 mice. This study unveils novel interactions between ADRD genetic susceptibility, BINT, and cognitive decline, thus identifying dysregulated pathways as targets in potential precision-medicine focused therapeutics to alleviate the disease burden among those affected by BINT.",2024,WpCNA; discrimination-learning index; eigenpeptides; label-free DIA-PASEF quantitative proteomics; low-intensity open-field blast; phosphopeptides; phosphoproteomic profiling,"Mice; Humans; Animals; tau Proteins; Frontotemporal Dementia; Phosphopeptides; Tauopathies; Mice, Transgenic; Cognition; Disease Models, Animal","Jackson, M; Chen, S; Nguyen, TT; Siedhoff, HR; Balderrama, A; Zuckerman, A; Li, R; Greenlief, CM; Cole, G; Frautschy, SA; Cui, J; Gu, Z"
The Optimization of a Natural Language Processing Approach for the Automatic Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using GPT Embeddings.,"The development of noninvasive and cost-effective methods of detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for its early prevention and mitigation. We optimize the detection of AD using natural language processing (NLP) of spontaneous speech through the use of audio enhancement techniques and novel transcription methodologies. Specifically, we utilized Boll Spectral Subtraction to improve audio fidelity and created transcriptions using state-of-the-art AI services-locally-based Wav2Vec and Whisper, alongside cloud-based IBM Cloud and Rev AI-evaluating their performance against traditional manual transcription methods. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were then trained and tested using GPT-based embeddings of transcriptions. Our findings revealed that AI-based transcriptions largely outperformed traditional manual ones, with Wav2Vec (enhanced audio) achieving the best accuracy and F-1 score (0.99 for both metrics) for locally-based systems and Rev AI (standard audio) performing the best for cloud-based systems (0.96 for both metrics). Furthermore, this study revealed the detrimental effects of interviewer speech on model performance in addition to the minimal effect of audio enhancement. Based on our findings, current AI transcription and NLP technologies are highly effective at accurately detecting AD with available data but struggle to classify probable AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, due to a lack of training data, laying the groundwork for the future implementation of an automatic AD detection system.",2024,GPT; NLP; dementia; embeddings,,"Runde, BS; Alapati, A; Bazan, NG"
A deeply supervised adaptable neural network for diagnosis and classification of Alzheimer's severity using multitask feature extraction.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent form of dementia, which is a gradual condition that begins with mild memory loss and progresses to difficulties communicating and responding to the environment. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques have resulted in large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data, leading to an increased interest in using deep learning for the early diagnosis and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease. This study uses machine learning (ML) methods to determine the severity level of Alzheimer's disease using MRI images, where the dataset consists of four levels of severity. A hybrid of 12 feature extraction methods is used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease severity, and six traditional machine learning methods are applied, including decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, linear discrimination analysis, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble learning methods. During training, optimization is performed to obtain the best solution for each classifier. Additionally, a CNN model is trained using a machine learning system algorithm to identify specific patterns. The accuracy of the Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Linear discrimination classifier, Decision tree, Ensembled learning, and presented CNN architecture are 67.5%, 72.3%, 74.5%, 65.6%, 62.4%, 73.8% and, 95.3%, respectively.

VentRa: distinguishing frontotemporal dementia from psychiatric disorders.,"The volume of the lateral ventricles is a reliable and sensitive indicator of brain atrophy and disease progression in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In this study, we validate our previously developed automated tool using ventricular features (known as VentRa) for the classification of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia versus a mixed cohort of neurodegenerative, vascular and psychiatric disorders from a clinically representative independent dataset. Lateral ventricles were segmented for 1110 subjects-14 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 30 other frontotemporal dementia, 70 Lewy body disease, 898 Alzheimer's disease, 62 vascular brain injury and 36 primary psychiatric disorder from the publicly accessible National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset to assess the performance of VentRa. Using ventricular features to discriminate behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia subjects from primary psychiatric disorders, VentRa achieved an accuracy rate of 84%, a sensitivity rate of 71% and a specificity rate of 89%. VentRa was able to identify behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia from a mixed age-matched cohort (i.e. other frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body disease, Alzheimer's disease, vascular brain injury and primary psychiatric disorders) and to correctly classify other disorders as 'not compatible with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia' with a specificity rate of 83%. The specificity rates against each of the other individual cohorts were 80% for other frontotemporal dementia, 83% for Lewy body disease, 83% for Alzheimer's disease, 84% for vascular brain injury and 89% for primary psychiatric disorders. VentRa is a robust and generalizable tool with potential usefulness for improving the diagnostic certainty of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, particularly for the differential diagnosis with primary psychiatric disorders.",2024,brain imaging; classification; dementia; frontotemporal dementia; lateral ventricles; psychiatric disorder,,"Manera, AL; Dadar, M; Ducharme, S; Collins, DL"

Cognitive Exercise for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Using a Social Robot.,"Reminiscence therapy (RT) can improve the mood and communication of persons living with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease related dementias (PLWD). Traditional RT requires professionals' facilitation, limiting its accessibility to PLWD. Social robotics has the potential to facilitate RT, enabling accessible, home-based RT. However, studies are needed to investigate how PLWD would perceive a robot-mediated RT (RMRT) and how to develop RMRT for positive user experience and successful adoption. In this paper, we developed a prototype of RMRT using a humanoid social robot and tested it with 12 participants (7 PLWD, 2 with mild cognitive impairment, and 3 informal caregivers). The robot automatically displayed a memory trigger on its tablet and engaged participants in a relatable conversation during RMRT. A mixed-method approach was employed to assess its acceptability and usability. Our results showed that PLWD had an overall positive user experience with the RMRT. Participants laughed and sang along with the robot during RMRT and demonstrated intention to use it. We additionally discussed robot control method and several critical problems for RMRT. The RMRT can facilitate both verbal and nonverbal social interaction for PLWD and holds promise for engaging, personalized, and efficient home-based cognitive exercises for PLWD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Social robots; cognitive exercise; dementia care; reminiscence therapy,,"Yuan, F; Boltz, M; Bilal, D; Jao, YL; Crane, M; Duzan, J; Bahour, A; Zhao, X"

Utilizing Siamese 4D-AlzNet and Transfer Learning to Identify Stages of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the general form of dementia, leading to a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss due to brain cell damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists in the early identification and prediction of AD patients, determining future risks and benefits for radiologists and doctors to save time and cost. Since deep learning (DL) approaches work well with massive datasets and have recently become helpful for AD detection, there remains an area for improvement in automating detection performance. Present approaches somehow addressed the challenges of limited annotated data samples for binary classification. This contrasts with prior state-of-the-art techniques, which were constrained by their incapacity to capture abstract-level information. In this paper, we proposed a Siamese 4D-AlzNet model comprised of four parallel convolutional neural network (CNN) streams (Five CNN layer blocks) and customized transfer learning models (Frozen VGG-19, Frozen VGG-16, and customized AlexNet). Siamese 4D-AlzNet was vertically and horizontally stored, and the spatial features were passed to the final layer for classification. For experiments, T1-weighted MRI images comprised of four distinct subject classes, normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and AD, have been employed. Our proposed models achieved outstanding accuracy, with a remarkable 95.05% accuracy distinguishing between normal and AD subjects. The performance across remaining binary class pairs consistently exceeded 90%. We thoroughly compared our model with the latest methods using the same dataset as our reference. Our proposed model improved NC-AD and MCI-AD classification accuracy by 2% 7%.",2024,classification; deep learning; late mild cognitive impairment; siamese-4D-AlzNet; transfer learning,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Deep Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Aged; Brain; Female; Male","Mehmood, A; Shahid, F; Khan, R; Ibrahim, MM; Zheng, Z"

Utilizing graph convolutional networks for identification of mild cognitive impairment from single modal fMRI data: a multiconnection pattern combination approach.,"Mild cognitive impairment plays a crucial role in predicting the early progression of Alzheimer's disease, and it can be used as an important indicator of the disease progression. Currently, numerous studies have focused on utilizing the functional brain network as a novel biomarker for mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. In this context, we employed a graph convolutional neural network to automatically extract functional brain network features, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction, to improve the mild cognitive impairment diagnosis performance. However, previous graph convolutional neural network approaches have primarily concentrated on single modes of brain connectivity, leading to a failure to leverage the potential complementary information offered by diverse connectivity patterns and limiting their efficacy. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel method called the graph convolutional neural network with multimodel connectivity, which integrates multimode connectivity for the identification of mild cognitive impairment using fMRI data and evaluates the graph convolutional neural network with multimodel connectivity approach through a mild cognitive impairment diagnostic task on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Overall, our experimental results show the superiority of the proposed graph convolutional neural network with multimodel connectivity approach, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.2% and an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.988.",2024,brain connectivity network; functional network; graph convolutional neural network; mild cognitive impairment; resting-state fMRI,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction,"He, J; Wang, P; He, J; Sun, C; Xu, X; Zhang, L; Wang, X; Gao, X"

MAD-Former: A Traceable Interpretability Model for Alzheimer's Disease Recognition Based on Multi-Patch Attention.,"The integration of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning techniques is one of the important research directions for the automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the satisfactory performance achieved by existing voxel-based models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such models only handle AD-related brain atrophy at a single spatial scale and lack spatial localization of abnormal brain regions based on model interpretability. To address the above limitations, we propose a traceable interpretability model for AD recognition based on multi-patch attention (MAD-Former). MAD-Former consists of two parts: recognition and interpretability. In the recognition part, we design a 3D brain feature extraction network to extract local features, followed by constructing a dual-branch attention structure with different patch sizes to achieve global feature extraction, forming a multi-scale spatial feature extraction framework. Meanwhile, we propose an important attention similarity position loss function to assist in model decision-making. The interpretability part proposes a traceable method that can obtain a 3D ROI space through attention-based selection and receptive field tracing. This space encompasses key brain tissues that influence model decisions. Experimental results reveal the significant role of brain tissues such as the Fusiform Gyrus (FuG) in AD recognition. MAD-Former achieves outstanding performance in different tasks on ADNI and OASIS datasets, demonstrating reliable model interpretability.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Deep Learning; Algorithms; Aged","Ye, J; Zeng, A; Pan, D; Zhang, Y; Zhao, J; Chen, Q; Liu, Y"

Automated detection of Alzheimer's disease: a multi-modal approach with 3D MRI and amyloid PET.,"Recent advances in deep learning and imaging technologies have revolutionized automated medical image analysis, especially in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease through neuroimaging. Despite the availability of various imaging modalities for the same patient, the development of multi-modal models leveraging these modalities remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and evaluating classification models using 2D and 3D MRI images and amyloid PET scans in uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks. Our findings demonstrate that models using volumetric data learn more effective representations than those using only 2D images. Furthermore, integrating multiple modalities enhances model performance over single-modality approaches significantly. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on the OASIS-3 cohort. Additionally, explainability analyses with Grad-CAM indicate that our model focuses on crucial AD-related regions for its predictions, underscoring its potential to aid in understanding the disease's causes.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography,"Castellano, G; Esposito, A; Lella, E; Montanaro, G; Vessio, G"

Volumetric brain MRI signatures of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the setting of dementia.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an important, emerging risk factor for dementia, but it is not clear whether HFpEF contributes to a specific pattern of neuroanatomical changes in dementia. A major challenge to studying this is the relative paucity of datasets of patients with dementia, with/without HFpEF, and relevant neuroimaging. We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of using modern data mining tools to create and analyze clinical imaging datasets and identify the neuroanatomical signature of HFpEF-associated dementia. We leveraged the bioinformatics tools at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to identify patients with a diagnosis of dementia with and without comorbid HFpEF using the electronic health record. We identified high resolution, clinically-acquired neuroimaging data on 30 dementia patients with HFpEF (age 76.9 ± 8.12 years, 61% female) as well as 301 age- and sex-matched patients with dementia but without HFpEF to serve as comparators (age 76.2 ± 8.52 years, 60% female). We used automated image processing pipelines to parcellate the brain into 132 structures and quantify their volume. We found six regions with significant atrophy associated with HFpEF: accumbens area, amygdala, posterior insula, anterior orbital gyrus, angular gyrus, and cerebellar white matter. There were no regions with atrophy inversely associated with HFpEF. Patients with dementia and HFpEF have a distinct neuroimaging signature compared to patients with dementia only. Five of the six regions identified in are in the temporo-parietal region of the brain. Future studies should investigate mechanisms of injury associated with cerebrovascular disease leading to subsequent brain atrophy.",2024,Clinical imaging; Data mining; Dementia; Electronic health record; Heart failure; Magnetic resonance imaging,"Humans; Female; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Heart Failure; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain; Atrophy; Dementia","Bermudez, C; Kerley, CI; Ramadass, K; Farber-Eger, EH; Lin, YC; Kang, H; Taylor, WD; Wells, QS; Landman, BA"

Diagnosis-Guided Deep Subspace Clustering Association Study for Pathogenetic Markers Identification of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Comparative Atlases.,"The roles of brain region activities and genotypic functions in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. Meanwhile, current imaging genetics methods are difficult to identify potential pathogenetic markers by correlation analysis between brain network and genetic variation. To discover disease-related brain connectome from the specific brain structure and the fine-grained level, based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and human Brainnetome atlases, the functional brain network is first constructed for each subject. Specifically, the upper triangle elements of the functional connectivity matrix are extracted as connectivity features. The clustering coefficient and the average weighted node degree are developed to assess the significance of every brain area. Since the constructed brain network and genetic data are characterized by non-linearity, high-dimensionality, and few subjects, the deep subspace clustering algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the original data. Our multilayer neural network helps capture the non-linear manifolds, and subspace clustering learns pairwise affinities between samples. Moreover, most approaches in neuroimaging genetics are unsupervised learning, neglecting the diagnostic information related to diseases. We presented a label constraint with diagnostic status to instruct the imaging genetics correlation analysis. To this end, a diagnosis-guided deep subspace clustering association (DDSCA) method is developed to discover brain connectome and risk genetic factors by integrating genotypes with functional network phenotypes. Extensive experiments prove that DDSCA achieves superior performance to most association methods and effectively selects disease-relevant genetic markers and brain connectome at the coarse-grained and fine-grained levels.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cluster Analysis; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Connectome; Algorithms; Aged; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Atlases as Topic; Neuroimaging,"Jiao, CN; Shang, J; Li, F; Cui, X; Wang, YL; Gao, YL; Liu, JX"
Reconstructing microvascular network skeletons from 3D images: What is the ground truth?,"Structural changes to microvascular networks are increasingly highlighted as markers of pathogenesis in a wide range of disease, e.g. Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and tumour growth. This has motivated the development of dedicated 3D imaging techniques, alongside the creation of computational modelling frameworks capable of using 3D reconstructed networks to simulate functional behaviours such as blood flow or transport processes. Extraction of 3D networks from imaging data broadly consists of two image processing steps: segmentation followed by skeletonisation. Much research effort has been devoted to segmentation field, and there are standard and widely-applied methodologies for creating and assessing gold standards or ground truths produced by manual annotation or automated algorithms. The Skeletonisation field, however, lacks widely applied, simple to compute metrics for the validation or optimisation of the numerous algorithms that exist to extract skeletons from binary images. This is particularly problematic as 3D imaging datasets increase in size and visual inspection becomes an insufficient validation approach. In this work, we first demonstrate the extent of the problem by applying 4 widely-used skeletonisation algorithms to 3 different imaging datasets. In doing so we show significant variability between reconstructed skeletons of the same segmented imaging dataset. Moreover, we show that such a structural variability propagates to simulated metrics such as blood flow. To mitigate this variability we introduce a new, fast and easy to compute super metric that compares the volume, connectivity, medialness, bifurcation point identification and homology of the reconstructed skeletons to the original segmented data. We then show that such a metric can be used to select the best performing skeletonisation algorithm for a given dataset, as well as to optimise its parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that the super metric can also be used to quickly identify how a particular skeletonisation algorithm could be improved, becoming a powerful tool in understanding the complex implication of small structural changes in a network.",2024,3D Imaging; Blood flow Simulations; Imaging-modelling Pipeline; Microvascular network; Skeletonisation; Uncertainty Quantification,"Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Neoplasms","Walsh, CL; Berg, M; West, H; Holroyd, NA; Walker-Samuel, S; Shipley, RJ"
A tensor decomposition scheme for EEG-based diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment.,"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the primary stage of acute Alzheimer's disease, and early detection is crucial for the person and those around him. It is difficult to recognize since this mild stage does not have clear clinical signs, and its symptoms are between normal aging and severe dementia. Here, we propose a tensor decomposition-based scheme for automatically diagnosing MCI using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. A new projection is proposed, which preserves the spatial information of the electrodes to construct a data tensor. Then, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition, the features are extracted, and a support vector machine (SVM) is used to discriminate MCI from normal subjects. The proposed scheme was tested on two different datasets. The results showed that the tensor-based method outperformed conventional methods in diagnosing MCI with an average classification accuracy of 93.96% and 78.65% for the first and second datasets, respectively. Therefore, it seems that maintaining the spatial topology of the signals plays a vital role in the processing of EEG signals.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC); Tensor decomposition,,"Faghfouri, A; Shalchyan, V; Toor, HG; Amjad, I; Niazi, IK"

Feasibility of Identifying Factors Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia in Real-World Data.,"A comprehensive view of factors associated with AD/ADRD will significantly aid in studies to develop new treatments for AD/ADRD and identify high-risk populations and patients for prevention efforts. In our study, we summarized the risk factors for AD/ADRD by reviewing existing meta-analyses and review articles on risk and preventive factors for AD/ADRD. In total, we extracted 477 risk factors in 10 categories from 537 studies. We constructed an interactive knowledge map to disseminate our study results. Most of the risk factors are accessible from structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and clinical narratives show promise as information sources. However, evaluating genomic risk factors using RWD remains a challenge, as genetic testing for AD/ADRD is still not a common practice and is poorly documented in both structured and unstructured EHRs. Considering the constantly evolving research on AD/ADRD risk factors, literature mining via NLP methods offers a solution to automatically update our knowledge map.",2024,Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia; Natural Language Processing,,"Chen, A; Li, Q; Huang, Y; Li, Y; Chuang, YN; Hu, X; Guo, S; Wu, Y; Guo, Y; Bian, J"
Wearable-Sensor-Based Weakly Supervised Parkinson's Disease Assessment with Data Augmentation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent dementia in the world. Wearable technology has been useful in the computer-aided diagnosis and long-term monitoring of PD in recent years. The fundamental issue remains how to assess the severity of PD using wearable devices in an efficient and accurate manner. However, in the real-world free-living environment, there are two difficult issues, poor annotation and class imbalance, both of which could potentially impede the automatic assessment of PD. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for assessing the severity of PD patient's in a free-living environment. Specifically, we use clustering methods to learn latent categories from the same activities, while latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models are utilized to capture latent features from multiple activities. Then, to mitigate the impact of data imbalance, we augment bag-level data while retaining key instance prototypes. To comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, we collected a dataset containing wearable-sensor signals from 83 individuals in real-life free-living conditions. The experimental results show that our framework achieves an astounding 73.48% accuracy in the fine-grained (normal, mild, moderate, severe) classification of PD severity based on hand movements. Overall, this study contributes to more accurate PD self-diagnosis in the wild, allowing doctors to provide remote drug intervention guidance.",2024,Parkinson’s disease; activity recognition; class imbalance; data augmentation; weak annotation; wearable sensor,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Movement; Wearable Electronic Devices; Severity of Illness Index; Upper Extremity,"Yue, P; Li, Z; Zhou, M; Wang, X; Yang, P"
Assessing Cognitive Workload in Motor Decision-Making through Functional Connectivity Analysis: Towards Early Detection and Monitoring of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, among others, are increasingly prevalent in the global population. The clinical diagnosis of these NDs is based on the detection and characterization of motor and non-motor symptoms. However, when these diagnoses are made, the subjects are often in advanced stages where neuromuscular alterations are frequently irreversible. In this context, we propose a methodology to evaluate the cognitive workload (CWL) of motor tasks involving decision-making processes. CWL is a concept widely used to address the balance between task demand and the subject's available resources to complete that task. In this study, multiple models for motor planning during a motor decision-making task were developed by recording EEG and EMG signals in n=17 healthy volunteers (9 males, 8 females, age 28.66±8.8 years). In the proposed test, volunteers have to make decisions about which hand should be moved based on the onset of a visual stimulus. We computed functional connectivity between the cortex and muscles, as well as among muscles using both corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence. Despite three models being generated, just one of them had strong performance. The results showed two types of motor decision-making processes depending on the hand to move. Moreover, the central processing of decision-making for the left hand movement can be accurately estimated using behavioral measures such as planning time combined with peripheral recordings like EMG signals. The models provided in this study could be considered as a methodological foundation to detect neuromuscular alterations in asymptomatic patients, as well as to monitor the process of a degenerative disease.",2024,cognitive workload; decision-making; functional connectivity; motor planning; neurodegenerative diseases; statistical modeling,"Male; Female; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cerebral Cortex; Muscle, Skeletal; Electromyography; Electroencephalography; Cognition","Cano, LA; Albarracín, AL; Pizá, AG; García-Cena, CE; Fernández-Jover, E; Farfán, FD"
Monitoring Disease Severity of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Single-Channel EEG Data Using Regression Analysis.,"A deviation in the soundness of cognitive health is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and it is important to monitor it early to prevent complicated diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Traditionally, MCI severity is monitored with manual scoring using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In this study, we propose a new MCI severity monitoring algorithm with regression analysis of extracted features of single-channel electro-encephalography (EEG) data by automatically generating severity scores equivalent to MoCA scores. We evaluated both multi-trial and single-trail analysis for the algorithm development. For multi-trial analysis, 590 features were extracted from the prominent event-related potential (ERP) points and corresponding time domain characteristics, and we utilized the lasso regression technique to select the best feature set. The 13 best features were used in the classical regression techniques: multivariate regression (MR), ensemble regression (ER), support vector regression (SVR), and ridge regression (RR). The best results were observed for ER with an RMSE of 1.6 and residual analysis. In single-trial analysis, we extracted a time-frequency plot image from each trial and fed it as an input to the constructed convolutional deep neural network (CNN). This deep CNN model resulted an RMSE of 2.76. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate automated scores for MCI severity equivalent to MoCA from single-channel EEG data with multi-trial and single data.",2024,Montreal cognitive assessment; deep learning; electroencephalography; ensemble regression; event-related potential; mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Regression Analysis; Electroencephalography; Patient Acuity,"Khatun, S; Morshed, BI; Bidelman, GM"
Classification Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia Using Physiological Data and ECD SPECT Images.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two most common forms of dementia. However, their neuropsychological and pathological features often overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between AD and VaD. In addition to clinical consultation and laboratory examinations, clinical dementia diagnosis in Taiwan will also include Tc-99m-ECD SPECT imaging examination. Through machine learning and deep learning technology, we explored the feasibility of using the above clinical practice data to distinguish AD and VaD. We used the physiological data (33 features) and Tc-99m-ECD SPECT images of 112 AD patients and 85 VaD patients in the Taiwanese Nuclear Medicine Brain Image Database to train the classification model. The results, after filtering by the number of SVM RFE 5-fold features, show that the average accuracy of physiological data in distinguishing AD/VaD is 81.22% and the AUC is 0.836; the average accuracy of training images using the Inception V3 model is 85% and the AUC is 0.95. Finally, Grad-CAM heatmap was used to visualize the areas of concern of the model and compared with the SPM analysis method to further understand the differences. This research method can quickly use machine learning and deep learning models to automatically extract image features based on a small amount of general clinical data to objectively distinguish AD and VaD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; ECD SPECT images; classification prediction; vascular dementia,,"Ni, YC; Lin, ZK; Cheng, CH; Pai, MC; Chiu, PY; Chang, CC; Chang, YT; Hung, GU; Lin, KJ; Hsiao, IT; Lin, CY; Yang, HC"

Highly accurate blood test for Alzheimer's disease is similar or superior to clinical cerebrospinal fluid tests.,"With the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying therapies, identifying patients who could benefit from these treatments becomes critical. In this study, we evaluated whether a precise blood test could perform as well as established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Plasma %p-tau217 (ratio of phosporylated-tau217 to non-phosphorylated tau) was analyzed by mass spectrometry in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n = 1,422) and the US Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) cohort (n = 337). Matched CSF samples were analyzed with clinically used and FDA-approved automated immunoassays for Aβ42/40 and p-tau181/Aβ42. The primary and secondary outcomes were detection of brain Aβ or tau pathology, respectively, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the reference standard. Main analyses were focused on individuals with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia), which is the target population for available disease-modifying treatments. Plasma %p-tau217 was clinically equivalent to FDA-approved CSF tests in classifying Aβ PET status, with an area under the curve (AUC) for both between 0.95 and 0.97. Plasma %p-tau217 was generally superior to CSF tests in classification of tau-PET with AUCs of 0.95-0.98. In cognitively impaired subcohorts (BioFINDER-2: n = 720; Knight ADRC: n = 50), plasma %p-tau217 had an accuracy, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 89-90% for Aβ PET and 87-88% for tau PET status, which was clinically equivalent to CSF tests, further improving to 95% using a two-cutoffs approach. Blood plasma %p-tau217 demonstrated performance that was clinically equivalent or superior to clinically used FDA-approved CSF tests in the detection of AD pathology.

Genome-wide epistasis analysis reveals gene-gene interaction network on an intermediate endophenotype P-tau/Aβ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly worldwide. The exact etiology of AD, particularly its genetic mechanisms, remains incompletely understood. Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which primarily focus on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with main effects, provide limited explanations for the ""missing heritability"" of AD, while there is growing evidence supporting the important role of epistasis. In this study, we performed a genome-wide SNP-SNP interaction detection using a linear regression model and employed multiple GPUs for parallel computing, significantly enhancing the speed of whole-genome analysis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau (P-tau)/amyloid-[Formula: see text] (A[Formula: see text]) ratio was used as a quantitative trait (QT) to enhance statistical power. Age, gender, and clinical diagnosis were included as covariates to control for potential non-genetic factors influencing AD. We identified 961 pairs of statistically significant SNP-SNP interactions, explaining a high-level variance of P-tau/A[Formula: see text] level, all of which exhibited marginal main effects. Additionally, we replicated 432 previously reported AD-related genes and found 11 gene-gene interaction pairs overlapping with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Our findings may contribute to partially explain the ""missing heritability"" of AD. The identified subnetwork may be associated with synaptic dysfunction, Wnt signaling pathway, oligodendrocytes, inflammation, hippocampus, and neuronal cells.",2024,,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Epistasis, Genetic; Endophenotypes; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Genome-Wide Association Study; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments","Zhang, Q; Liu, J; Liu, H; Ao, L; Xi, Y; Chen, D"
Surface-functionalized SERS platform for deep learning-assisted diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to stall the deterioration of brain function, but conventional diagnostic methods require complicated analytical procedures or inflict acute pain on the patient. Then, label-free Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis of blood-based biomarkers is a convenient alternative to rapidly obtain spectral information from biofluids. However, despite the rapid acquisition of spectral information from biofluids, it is challenging to distinguish spectral features of biomarkers due to interference from biofluidic components. Here, we introduce a deep learning-assisted, SERS-based platform for separate analysis of blood-based amyloid β (1-42) and metabolites, enabling the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. SERS substrates consisting of Au nanowire arrays are fabricated and functionalized in two characteristic ways to compare the validity of different Alzheimer's disease biomarkers measured on our SERS system. The 6E10 antibody is immobilized for the capture of amyloid β (1-42) and analysis of its oligomerization process, while various self-assembled monolayers are attached for different dipole interactions with blood-based metabolites. Ultimately, SERS spectra of blood plasma of Alzheimer's disease patients and human controls are measured on the substrates and classified via advanced deep learning techniques that automatically extract informative features to learn generalizable representations. Accuracies up to 99.5% are achieved for metabolite-based analyses, which are verified with an explainable artificial intelligence technique that identifies key spectral features used for classification and for deducing significant biomarkers.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Blood-based biomarker; Deep learning; Gold nanowire array; Label-free diagnosis; Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Biosensing Techniques; Metal Nanoparticles; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Biomarkers","Kim, M; Huh, S; Park, HJ; Cho, SH; Lee, MY; Jo, S; Jung, YS"
Atypical cortical hierarchy in Aβ-positive older adults and its reflection in spontaneous speech.,"Abnormal deposition of Aβ amyloid is an early neuropathological marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), arising long ahead of clinical symptoms. Non-invasive measures of associated early neurofunctional changes, together with easily accessible behavioral readouts of these changes, could be of great clinical benefit. We pursued this aim by investigating large-scale cortical gradients of functional connectivity with functional MRI, which capture the hierarchical integration of cortical functions, together with acoustic-prosodic features from spontaneous speech, in cognitively unimpaired older adults with and without Aβ positivity (total N = 188). We predicted distortions of the cortical hierarchy associated with prosodic changes in the Aβ + group. Results confirmed substantially altered cortical hierarchies and less variability in these in the Aβ + group, together with an increase in quantitative prosodic measures, which correlated with gradient variability as well as digit span test scores. Overall, these findings confirm that long before the clinical stage and objective cognitive impairment, increased risk of cognitive decline as indexed by Aβ accumulation is marked by neurofunctional changes in the cortical hierarchy, which are related to automatically extractable speech patterns and alterations in working memory functions.",2024,Aβ amyloid; Cognitive decline; Cortical gradient; Dementia; Functional connectivity,Humans; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Speech; Positron-Emission Tomography; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction,"He, R; Al-Tamimi, J; Sánchez-Benavides, G; Montaña-Valverde, G; Domingo Gispert, J; Grau-Rivera, O; Suárez-Calvet, M; Minguillon, C; Fauria, K; Navarro, A; Hinzen, W"
Glymphatic system dysfunction in middle-aged and elderly chronic insomnia patients with cognitive impairment evidenced by diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).,Chronic insomnia impairs the glymphatic system and may lead to cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly population.

Discriminating nonfluent/agrammatic and logopenic PPA variants with automatically extracted morphosyntactic measures from connected speech.,"Morphosyntactic assessments are important for characterizing individuals with nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA). Yet, standard tests are subject to examiner bias and often fail to differentiate between nfvPPA and logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA). Moreover, relevant neural signatures remain underexplored. Here, we leverage natural language processing tools to automatically capture morphosyntactic disturbances and their neuroanatomical correlates in 35 individuals with nfvPPA relative to 10 healthy controls (HC) and 26 individuals with lvPPA. Participants described a picture, and ensuing transcripts were analyzed via part-of-speech tagging to extract sentence-related features (e.g., subordinating and coordinating conjunctions), verbal-related features (e.g., tense markers), and nominal-related features (e.g., subjective and possessive pronouns). Gradient boosting machines were used to classify between groups using all features. We identified the most discriminant morphosyntactic marker via a feature importance algorithm and examined its neural correlates via voxel-based morphometry. Individuals with nfvPPA produced fewer morphosyntactic elements than the other two groups. Such features robustly discriminated them from both individuals with lvPPA and HCs with an AUC of .95 and .82, respectively. The most discriminatory feature corresponded to subordinating conjunctions was correlated with cortical atrophy within the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus across groups (p",2024,Cortical atrophy; Morphosyntax; Natural language processing; Primary progressive aphasia; Subordination production,"Humans; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Speech; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Language; Atrophy","Lukic, S; Fan, Z; García, AM; Welch, AE; Ratnasiri, BM; Wilson, SM; Henry, ML; Vonk, J; Deleon, J; Miller, BL; Miller, Z; Mandelli, ML; Gorno-Tempini, ML"

Modeling genotype-protein interaction and correlation for Alzheimer's disease: a multi-omics imaging genetics study.,"Integrating and analyzing multiple omics data sets, including genomics, proteomics and radiomics, can significantly advance researchers' comprehensive understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, current methodologies primarily focus on the main effects of genetic variation and protein, overlooking non-additive effects such as genotype-protein interaction (GPI) and correlation patterns in brain imaging genetics studies. Importantly, these non-additive effects could contribute to intermediate imaging phenotypes, finally leading to disease occurrence. In general, the interaction between genetic variations and proteins, and their correlations are two distinct biological effects, and thus disentangling the two effects for heritable imaging phenotypes is of great interest and need. Unfortunately, this issue has been largely unexploited. In this paper, to fill this gap, we propose $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{G}$enotype-$\textbf{P}$rotein $\textbf{I}$nteraction and $\textbf{C}$orrelation disentangling method ($\textbf{MT-GPIC}$) to identify GPI and extract correlation patterns between them. To ensure stability and interpretability, we use novel and off-the-shelf penalties to identify meaningful genetic risk factors, as well as exploit the interconnectedness of different brain regions. Additionally, since computing GPI poses a high computational burden, we develop a fast optimization strategy for solving MT-GPIC, which is guaranteed to converge. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set show that MT-GPIC achieves higher correlation coefficients and classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our approach could effectively identify interpretable phenotype-related GPI and correlation patterns in high-dimensional omics data sets. These findings not only enhance the diagnostic accuracy but also contribute valuable insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of AD.",2024,biomarker identification; genotype–protein interaction and correlation; multi-omics brain imaging genetics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Multiomics; Genotype; Neuroimaging; Phenotype; Brain,"Zhang, J; Ma, Z; Yang, Y; Guo, L; Du, L"

Generation of tau dephosphorylation-targeting chimeras for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies.,"Abnormal hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau protein play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other tauopathies. Selective elimination of hyperphosphorylated tau is promising for the therapy of these diseases. We have conceptualized a strategy, named dephosphorylation-targeting chimeras (DEPTACs), for specifically hijacking phosphatases to tau to debilitate its hyperphosphorylation. Here, we conducted the step-by-step optimization of each constituent motif to generate DEPTACs with reasonable effectiveness in facilitating the dephosphorylation and subsequent clearance of pathological tau. Specifically, for one of the selected chimeras, D16, we demonstrated its significant efficiency in rescuing the neurodegeneration caused by neurotoxic K18-tau seeds in vitro. Moreover, intravenous administration of D16 also alleviated tau pathologies in the brain and improved memory deficits in AD mice. These results suggested DEPTACs as targeted modulators of tau phosphorylation, which hold therapeutic potential for AD and other tauopathies.",2024,Dephosphorylation-targeting chimeras; Tauopathy; Therapeutic potential; tau,Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Phosphorylation; Brain,"Su, J; Xiao, Y; Wei, L; Lei, H; Sun, F; Wang, W; Yin, J; Xiong, R; Li, S; Zhang, P; Zhou, Y; Wang, X; Zheng, J; Wang, JZ"

Intra-Atlas Node Size Effects on Graph Metrics in fMRI Data: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Impairment.,"Network neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field merging insights from neuroscience and network theory, offers a profound understanding of neural network intricacies. However, the impact of varying node sizes on computed graph metrics in neuroimaging data remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by adopting a data-driven methodology to delineate functional nodes and assess their influence on graph metrics. Using the Neuromark framework, automated independent component analysis is applied to resting state fMRI data, capturing functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices. Global and local graph metrics reveal intricate connectivity patterns, emphasizing the need for nuanced analysis. Notably, node sizes, computed based on voxel counts, contribute to a novel metric termed 'node-metric coupling' (NMC). Correlations between graph metrics and node dimensions are consistently observed. The study extends its analysis to a dataset comprising Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and control subjects, showcasing the potential of NMC as a biomarker for brain disorders. The two key outcomes underscore the interplay between node sizes and resultant graph metrics within a given atlas, shedding light on an often-overlooked source of variability. Additionally, the study highlights the utility of NMC as a valuable biomarker, emphasizing the necessity of accounting for node sizes in future neuroimaging investigations. This work contributes to refining comparative studies employing diverse atlases and advocates for thoughtful consideration of intra-atlas node size in shaping graph metrics, paving the way for more robust neuroimaging research.",2024,brain networks; fMRI; functional network connectivity; graph metrics; node size,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Mapping; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Brain,"Kolla, S; Falakshahi, H; Abrol, A; Fu, Z; Calhoun, VD"
"Influence of Physiological Variables and Comorbidities on Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 Levels in Cognitively Unimpaired Individuals.","Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a promising tool that may help in early diagnosis. However, their levels may be influenced by physiological parameters and comorbidities that should be considered before they can be used at the population level. For this purpose, we assessed the influences of different comorbidities on AD plasma markers in 208 cognitively unimpaired subjects. We analyzed both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 using the fully automated Lumipulse platform. The relationships between the different plasma markers and physiological variables were studied using linear regression models. The mean differences in plasma markers according to comorbidity groups were also studied. The glomerular filtration rate showed an influence on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The amyloid ratio was significantly lower in diabetic and hypertensive subjects, and the mean p-tau181 levels were higher in hypertensive subjects. The glomerular filtration rate may have an inverse relationship on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the amyloid ratio, suggesting that the latter is a more stable marker to use in the general population. Cardiovascular risk factors might have a long-term effect on the amyloid ratio and plasma levels of p-tau181.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; comorbidities; plasma biomarkers; presymptomatic stages; tau protein,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Comorbidity; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Martínez-Dubarbie, F; Guerra-Ruiz, A; López-García, S; Irure-Ventura, J; Lage, C; Fernández-Matarrubia, M; Pozueta-Cantudo, A; García-Martínez, M; Corrales-Pardo, A; Bravo, M; Martín-Arroyo, J; Infante, J; López-Hoyos, M; García-Unzueta, MT; Sánchez-Juan, P; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, E"

An Alzheimer's Disease classification network based on MRI utilizing diffusion maps for multi-scale feature fusion in graph convolution.,"Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been widely utilized in Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification research due to its ability to automatically learn robust and powerful feature representations. Inter-patient relationships are effectively captured by constructing patients magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data as graph data, where nodes represent individuals and edges denote the relationships between them. However, the performance of GCNs might be constrained by the construction of the graph adjacency matrix, thereby leading to learned features potentially overlooking intrinsic correlations among patients, which ultimately causes inaccurate disease classifications. To address this issue, we propose an Alzheimer's disease Classification network based on MRI utilizing diffusion maps for multi-scale feature fusion in graph convolution. This method aims to tackle the problem of features neglecting intrinsic relationships among patients while integrating features from diffusion mapping with different neighbor counts to better represent patients and achieve an accurate AD classification. Initially, the diffusion maps method conducts diffusion information in the feature space, thus breaking free from the constraints of diffusion based on the adjacency matrix. Subsequently, the diffusion features with different neighbor counts are merged, and a self-attention mechanism is employed to adaptively adjust the weights of diffusion features at different scales, thereby comprehensively and accurately capturing patient characteristics. Finally, metric learning techniques enhance the similarity of node features within the same category in the graph structure and bring node features of different categories more distant from each other. This study aims to enhance the classification accuracy of AD, by providing an effective tool for early diagnosis and intervention. It offers valuable information for clinical decisions and personalized treatment. Experimentation on the publicly accessible Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset validated our method's competitive performance across various AD-related classification tasks.

Enhancing foveal avascular zone analysis for Alzheimer's diagnosis with AI segmentation and machine learning using multiple radiomic features.,"We propose a hybrid technique that employs artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation and machine learning classification using multiple features extracted from the foveal avascular zone (FAZ)-a retinal biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-to improve the disease diagnostic performance. Imaging data of optical coherence tomography angiography from 37 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 48 healthy controls were investigated. The presence or absence of brain amyloids was confirmed using amyloid positron emission tomography. In the superficial capillary plexus of the angiography scans, the FAZ was automatically segmented using an AI method to extract multiple biomarkers (area, solidity, compactness, roundness, and eccentricity), which were paired with clinical data (age and sex) as common correction variables. We used a light-gradient boosting machine (a light-gradient boosting machine is a machine learning algorithm based on trees utilizing gradient boosting) to diagnose Alzheimer's disease by integrating the corresponding multiple radiomic biomarkers. Fivefold cross-validation was applied for analysis, and the diagnostic performance for Alzheimer's disease was determined by the area under the curve. The proposed hybrid technique achieved an area under the curve of [Formula: see text]%, outperforming the existing single-feature (area) criteria by over 13%. Furthermore, in the holdout test set, the proposed technique exhibited a 14% improvement compared to single features, achieving an area under the curve of 72.0± 4.8%.

"Comparing the performance of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to predict time-to-event: A simulation study for conversion to mild cognitive impairment.","Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a condition characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities, specifically in memory, language, and attention, that is beyond what is expected due to normal aging. Detection of MCI is crucial for providing appropriate interventions and slowing down the progression of dementia. There are several automated predictive algorithms for prediction using time-to-event data, but it is not clear which is best to predict the time to conversion to MCI. There is also confusion if algorithms with fewer training weights are less accurate. We compared three algorithms, from smaller to large numbers of training weights: a statistical predictive model (Cox proportional hazards model, CoxPH), a machine learning model (Random Survival Forest, RSF), and a deep learning model (DeepSurv). To compare the algorithms under different scenarios, we created a simulated dataset based on the Alzheimer NACC dataset. We found that the CoxPH model was among the best-performing models, in all simulated scenarios. In a larger sample size (n = 6,000), the deep learning algorithm (DeepSurv) exhibited comparable accuracy (73.1%) to the CoxPH model (73%). In the past, ignoring heterogeneity in the CoxPH model led to the conclusion that deep learning methods are superior. We found that when using the CoxPH model with heterogeneity, its accuracy is comparable to that of DeepSurv and RSF. Furthermore, when unobserved heterogeneity is present, such as missing features in the training, all three models showed a similar drop in accuracy.

Enabling Personalization for Digital Cognitive Stimulation to Support Communication With People With Dementia: Pilot Intervention Study as a Prelude to AI Development.,"Maintaining good communication and engagement between people with dementia and their caregivers is a major challenge in dementia care. Cognitive stimulation is a psychosocial intervention that supports communication and engagement, and several digital applications for cognitive stimulation have been developed. Personalization is an important factor for obtaining sustainable benefits, but the time and effort required to personalize and optimize applications often makes them difficult for routine use by nonspecialist caregivers and families. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to support automation of the personalization process, its use is largely unexplored because of the lack of suitable data from which to develop and train machine learning models.",2024,AI; artificial intelligence; cognitive stimulation; communication; dementia; digital technology; engagement,,"Hird, N; Osaki, T; Ghosh, S; Palaniappan, SK; Maeda, K"

We, therefore, established the novel concept of computed tomography (CT) hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch, i.e., an ischemic core lesion visible on cerebral perfusion CT without visible hypodensity in the corresponding native cerebral CT.

Automating the analysis of eye movement for different neurodegenerative disorders.,"The clinical observation and assessment of extra-ocular movements is common practice in assessing neurodegenerative disorders but remains observer-dependent. In the present study, we propose an algorithm that can automatically identify saccades, fixation, smooth pursuit, and blinks using a non-invasive eye tracker. Subsequently, response-to-stimuli-derived interpretable features were elicited that objectively and quantitatively assess patient behaviors. The cohort analysis encompasses persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease mimics (PDM), and controls (CTRL). Overall, results suggested that the AD/MCI and PD groups had significantly different saccade and pursuit characteristics compared to CTRL when the target moved faster or covered a larger visual angle during smooth pursuit. These two groups also displayed more omitted antisaccades and longer average antisaccade latency than CTRL. When reading a text passage silently, people with AD/MCI had more fixations. During visual exploration, people with PD demonstrated a more variable saccade duration than other groups. In the prosaccade task, the PD group showed a significantly smaller average hypometria gain and accuracy, with the most statistical significance and highest AUC scores of features studied. The minimum saccade gain was a PD-specific feature different from CTRL and PDM. These features, as oculographic biomarkers, can be potentially leveraged in distinguishing different types of NDs, yielding more objective and precise protocols to diagnose and monitor disease progression.",2024,Biomarkers; Eye tracking; Interpretability; Neurodegenerative disorders,Humans; Eye Movements; Parkinson Disease; Saccades; Alzheimer Disease; Blinking,"Li, D; Butala, AA; Moro-Velazquez, L; Meyer, T; Oh, ES; Motley, C; Villalba, J; Dehak, N"

Cross-Spatiotemporal Graph Convolution Networks for Skeleton-Based Parkinsonian Gait MDS-UPDRS Score Estimation.,"Gait impairment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is quantitatively assessed using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), a well-established clinical tool. Objective and efficient PD gait assessment is crucial for developing interventions to slow or halt its advancement. Skeleton-based PD gait MDS-UPDRS score estimation has attracted increasing interest in improving diagnostic efficiency and objectivity. However, previous works ignore the important cross-spacetime dependencies between joints in PD gait. Moreover, existing PD gait skeleton datasets are very small, which is a big issue in deep learning-based gait studies. In this work, we collect a sizable PD gait skeleton dataset by multi-view Azure Kinect sensors. The collected dataset contains 102 PD patients and 30 healthy older adults. In addition, gait data from 16 young adults (aged 24-50 years) are collected to further examine the effect of age on PD gait assessment. For skeleton-based automatic PD gait analysis, we propose a novel cross-spatiotemporal graph convolution network (CST-GCN) to learn complex features of gait patterns. Specifically, a gait graph labeling strategy is designed to assemble and group cross-spacetime neighbors of the root node according to the spatiotemporal semantics of the gait skeleton. Based on this strategy, the CST-GCN module explicitly models the cross-spacetime dependencies among joints. Finally, a dual-path model is presented to realize the modeling and fusion of spatial, temporal, and cross-spacetime gait features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method on the collected dataset.",2024,,Humans; Aged; Parkinson Disease; Movement; Gait; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Skeleton,"Tian, H; Li, H; Jiang, W; Ma, X; Li, X; Wu, H; Li, Y"

Undersampling and cumulative class re-decision methods to improve detection of agitation in people with dementia.,"Agitation is one of the most prevalent symptoms in people with dementia (PwD) that can place themselves and the caregiver's safety at risk. Developing objective agitation detection approaches is important to support health and safety of PwD living in a residential setting. In a previous study, we collected multimodal wearable sensor data from 17 participants for 600 days and developed machine learning models for detecting agitation in 1-min windows. However, there are significant limitations in the dataset, such as imbalance problem and potential imprecise labels as the occurrence of agitation is much rarer in comparison to the normal behaviours. In this paper, we first implemented different undersampling methods to eliminate the imbalance problem, and came to the conclusion that only 20% of normal behaviour data were adequate to train a competitive agitation detection model. Then, we designed a weighted undersampling method to evaluate the manual labeling mechanism given the ambiguous time interval assumption. After that, the postprocessing method of cumulative class re-decision (CCR) was proposed based on the historical sequential information and continuity characteristic of agitation, improving the decision-making performance for the potential application of agitation detection system. The results showed that a combination of undersampling and CCR improved F1-score and other metrics to varying degrees with less training time and data.",2024,Agitation detection; Decision-making; Imbalance; Machine learning; Postprocessing; Undersampling,,"Meng, Z; Iaboni, A; Ye, B; Newman, K; Mihailidis, A; Deng, Z; Khan, SS"

rworkflows: automating reproducible practices for the R community.,"Despite calls to improve reproducibility in research, achieving this goal remains elusive even within computational fields. Currently, >50% of R packages are distributed exclusively through GitHub. While the trend towards sharing open-source software has been revolutionary, GitHub does not have any default built-in checks for minimal coding standards or software usability. This makes it difficult to assess the current quality R packages, or to consistently use them over time and across platforms. While GitHub-native solutions are technically possible, they require considerable time and expertise for each developer to write, implement, and maintain. To address this, we develop rworkflows; a suite of tools to make robust continuous integration and deployment ( https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows ). rworkflows can be implemented by developers of all skill levels using a one-time R function call which has both sensible defaults and extensive options for customisation. Once implemented, any updates to the GitHub repository automatically trigger parallel workflows that install all software dependencies, run code checks, generate a dedicated documentation website, and deploy a publicly accessible containerised environment. By making the rworkflows suite free, automated, and simple to use, we aim to promote widespread adoption of reproducible practices across a continually growing R community.",2024,,,"Schilder, BM; Murphy, AE; Skene, NG"

Magnetic resonance image-based brain age as a discriminator of dementia conversion in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"Patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a conversion rate of approximately 10% to dementia within 2 years. We aimed to investigate whether brain age is an important factor in predicting conversion to dementia in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychological evaluation, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and [18F]-florbetaben positron emission tomography. Brain age was determined by the volumetric assessment of 12 distinct brain regions using an automatic segmentation software. During the follow-up period, 38% of the patients converted from amnestic MCI to dementia. Further, 73% of patients had a brain age greater than their actual chronological age. When defining 'survival' as the non-conversion of MCI to dementia, these groups differed significantly in survival probability (p = 0.036). The low-educated female group with a brain age greater than their actual age had the lowest survival rate among all groups.

Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of resting-state fMRI driven machine learning algorithms in the detection of mild cognitive impairment.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a potential therapeutic window in the prevention of dementia; however, automated detection of early cognitive deterioration is an unresolved issue. The aim of our study was to compare various classification approaches to differentiate MCI patients from healthy controls, based on rs-fMRI data, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Own dataset (from two centers) and ADNI database were used during the analysis. Three fMRI parameters were applied in five feature selection algorithms: local correlation, intrinsic connectivity, and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations. Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods were applied for classification. We achieved a relatively wide range of 78-87% accuracy for the various feature selection methods with SVM combining the three rs-fMRI parameters. In the ADNI datasets case we can also see even 90% accuracy scores. RF provided a more harmonized result among the feature selection algorithms in both datasets with 80-84% accuracy for our local and 74-82% for the ADNI database. Despite some lower performance metrics of some algorithms, most of the results were positive and could be seen in two unrelated datasets which increase the validity of our methods.

Factors affecting the labelling accuracy of brain MRI studies relevant for deep learning abnormality detection.,"Unlocking the vast potential of deep learning-based computer vision classification systems necessitates large data sets for model training. Natural Language Processing (NLP)-involving automation of dataset labelling-represents a potential avenue to achieve this. However, many aspects of NLP for dataset labelling remain unvalidated. Expert radiologists manually labelled over 5,000 MRI head reports in order to develop a deep learning-based neuroradiology NLP report classifier. Our results demonstrate that binary labels (normal vs. abnormal) showed high rates of accuracy, even when only two MRI sequences (T2-weighted and those based on diffusion weighted imaging) were employed as opposed to all sequences in an examination. Meanwhile, the accuracy of more specific labelling for multiple disease categories was variable and dependent on the category. Finally, resultant model performance was shown to be dependent on the expertise of the original labeller, with worse performance seen with non-expert vs. expert labellers.",2023,MRI; computer vision system; deep learning; labelling; neuroradiology,,"Benger, M; Wood, DA; Kafiabadi, S; Al Busaidi, A; Guilhem, E; Lynch, J; Townend, M; Montvila, A; Siddiqui, J; Gadapa, N; Barker, G; Ourselin, S; Cole, JH; Booth, TC"
A Deep-Learning Enabled Automatic Fetal Thalamus Diameter Measurement Algorithm.,"The analysis of maternal factors that impact the normal development of the fetal thalamus is an emerging field of research and requires the retrospective measurement of fetal thalamus diameter (FTD). Unfortunately, FTD is not measured in routine 2D ultrasound (2D-US) screenings of fetuses. Manual measurement of FTD is a laborious, difficult, and error-prone process because the thalamus lacks well-defined boundaries in 2D-US images of the fetal brain as it has a similar echogenicity to the surrounding brain tissue. Traditional methods based on statistical shape models (SSMs) perform poorly in measuring FTD due to the noisy textures and fuzzy edges of the fetal thalamus in 2D-US images of the fetal brain. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a deep learning-based automatic FTD measurement algorithm, FTDNet. FTDNet measures FTD by learning to directly detect the measurement landmarks through supervised learning. The algorithm first detects the region of the brain that contains the thalamus structure, and then focuses on processing that region for FTD landmark detection. Our FTD dataset, developed through a consensus between two ultrasonographers, contains 1,111 pairs of landmark coordinates for measuring FTD and verified bounding boxes surrounding the fetal thalamus. To assess FTDNet's measurement consistency compared to the ground truth, we used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). FTDNet achieved an ICC score of 0.734, significantly outperforming the prior SSM method and other baseline comparison methods. Our findings are an important step forward in understanding the maternal factors which influence fetal brain development.Clinical relevance- This work proposes an end-to-end thalamus detection and measurement algorithm for measuring fetal thalamus diameter. Our work represents a significant step in the research of how maternal factors can impact fetal thalamus development. The development of an automatic and accurate method for measuring FTD through deep learning has the potential to greatly advance this field of study.",2023,,Humans; Retrospective Studies; Deep Learning; Frontotemporal Dementia; Algorithms; Fetus; Thalamus,"Zhou, S; Sridar, P; Kennedy, NJ; Quinton, A; Ahn, E; Nanan, R; Kim, J"
An Interpretable Framework for Identifying Cerebral Microbleeds and Alzheimer's Disease Severity using Multimodal Data.,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are tiny chronic brain haemorrhages that have been recognised as prognostic indicators for a number of acute cerebrovascular disorders, such as stroke, traumatic disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. For early-stage chronic disease diagnosis, it is challenging to automate the detection of CMBs and increase the reliability of prediction outputs. This study developed a system for identifying microbleeds in MRI images and gene expression data and determining the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Initially, a spike neural network (SNN) and decision tree were utilised to identify microbleeds in AD from MRI images and gene expression respectively. However, the conclusions of these two methods cannot be interpreted due to the complexity of their internal processing steps. This study proposed two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for interpreting prediction outputs in an effort to boost reliability. Pixel density analysis (PDA) and probabilistic graphical model (PGM) explain the decision-making processes for MRI images and gene expression data for the diagnosis of microbleeds and the severity analysis of AD.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Reproducibility of Results; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Brain,"Kamal, MS; Chowdhury, L; Nimmy, SF; Hasan Rafi, TH; Chae, DK"
Predicting Memory Score Using Paralinguistic Features.,"An automated method of assessing short term memory can act as a dementia risk predictor, as poor short-term memory is strongly linked to early signs of dementia. While previous works show the feasibility of using speech to predict healthy and diagnosed dementia participants, there are still gaps in predicting 'dementia risk' and clear difficulties distinguishing early dementia with regular ageing. We extracted paralinguistic features from audio of individuals completing an over the phone episodic memory test, LOGOS. These paralinguistic features were used to discriminate between those with strong and poor short term memory performance. This work also explored various feature selection methods and tested this method across multiple datasets. Our best result was achieved using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, obtaining accuracy of 84% per audio recording.Clinical relevance- This work establishes the efficacy of using speech from older participants completing the LOGOS episodic memory test to estimate risk of dementia.",2023,,"Humans; Aging; Memory, Episodic; Dementia","Gray, R; Shahin, M; Valenzuela, M; Ahmed, B"

AI-assisted quantification of hypothalamic atrophy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by convolutional neural network-based automatic segmentation.,"The hypothalamus is a small structure of the brain with an essential role in metabolic homeostasis, sleep regulation, and body temperature control. Some neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and dementia syndromes are reported to be related to hypothalamic volume alterations. Despite its crucial role in human body regulation, neuroimaging studies of this structure are rather scarce due to work-intensive operator-dependent manual delineations from MRI and lack of automated segmentation tools. In this study we present a fully automatic approach based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for hypothalamic segmentation and volume quantification. We applied CNN of U-Net architecture with EfficientNetB0 backbone to allow for accurate automatic hypothalamic segmentation in seconds on a GPU. We further applied our approach for the quantification of the normalized hypothalamic volumes to a large neuroimaging dataset of 432 ALS patients and 112 healthy controls (without the ground truth labels). Using the automated volumetric analysis, we could reproduce hypothalamic atrophy findings associated with ALS by detecting significant volume differences between ALS patients and controls at the group level. In conclusion, a fast and unbiased AI-assisted hypothalamic quantification method is introduced in this study (whose acceptance rate based on the outlier removal strategy was estimated to be above 95%) and made publicly available for researchers interested in the conduction of hypothalamus studies at a large scale.",2023,,"Humans; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Atrophy; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Vernikouskaya, I; Müller, HP; Roselli, F; Ludolph, AC; Kassubek, J; Rasche, V"
Correlation transfer function analysis as a biomarker for Alzheimer brain plasticity using longitudinal resting-state fMRI data.,"Neural plasticity is the ability of the brain to alter itself functionally and structurally as a result of its experience. However, longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of the brain are still unrevealed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to discover the significant connections (SCs) between brain regions for AD stages longitudinally using correlation transfer function (CorrTF) as a new biomarker for the disease progression. The dataset consists of: 29 normal controls (NC), and 23, 24, and 23 for early, late mild cognitive impairments (EMCI, LMCI), and ADs, respectively, along three distant visits. The brain was divided into 116 regions using the automated anatomical labeling atlas, where the intensity time series is calculated, and the CorrTF connections are extracted for each region. Finally, the standard t-test and ANOVA test were employed to investigate the SCs for each subject's visit. No SCs, along three visits, were found For NC subjects. The most SCs were mainly directed from cerebellum in case of EMCI and LMCI. Furthermore, the hippocampus connectivity increased in LMCI compared to EMCI whereas missed in AD. Additionally, the patterns of longitudinal changes among the different AD stages compared to Pearson Correlation were similar, for SMC, VC, DMN, and Cereb networks, while differed for EAN and SN networks.

Although their prevalence increases with age, small and punctate WMHs have been reported with surprisingly high frequency even in young, neurologically asymptomatic adults. However, most automated methods to segment WMH published to date are not optimized for detecting small and sparse WMH. Here we present the SHIVA-WMH tool, a deep-learning (DL)-based automatic WMH segmentation tool that has been trained with manual segmentations of WMH in a wide range of WMH severity. We show that it is able to detect WMH with high efficiency in subjects with only small punctate WMH as well as in subjects with large WMHs (i.e., with confluency) in evaluation datasets from three distinct databases: magnetic resonance imaging-Share consisting of young university students, MICCAI 2017 WMH challenge dataset consisting of older patients from memory clinics, and UK Biobank with community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults. Across these three cohorts with a wide-ranging WMH load, our tool achieved voxel-level and individual lesion cluster-level Dice scores of 0.66 and 0.71, respectively, which were higher than for three reference tools tested: the lesion prediction algorithm implemented in the lesion segmentation toolbox (LPA: Schmidt), PGS tool, a DL-based algorithm and the current winner of the MICCAI 2017 WMH challenge (Park et al.), and HyperMapper tool (Mojiri Forooshani et al.), another DL-based method with high reported performance in subjects with mild WMH burden. Our tool is publicly and openly available to the research community to facilitate investigations of WMH across a wide range of severity in other cohorts, and to contribute to our understanding of the emergence and progression of WMH.",2024,automatic segmentation; cerebral small vessel disease; deep-learning; magnetic resonance imaging; white matter hyperintensities,Middle Aged; Humans; Aged; White Matter; Stroke; Algorithms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases,"Tsuchida, A; Boutinaud, P; Verrecchia, V; Tzourio, C; Debette, S; Joliot, M"

A Review of Artificial Intelligence-Based Gait Evaluation and Rehabilitation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disease of the central nervous system that affects both motor and non-motor functions. In most cases, symptoms develop gradually, with non-motor symptoms increasing in frequency as the condition progresses. Tremors, stiffness, slow movements, and difficulty walking are some of the early symptoms. There may be problems with cognition, behavior, sleep, and thinking. Dementia caused by PD becomes more common as the disease progresses. The development of PD is linked to certain sequences of motion that eventually contribute to diminished function. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PWPD) have a sluggish, scattered gait that is accompanied by intermittent freezing of gait (FOG), in which efficient heading briefly pauses. In individuals with severe PD, FOG is a neurological deficit that is related to falls and has an unfavorable impact on the patient's standard of living. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ambient intelligence (AmI) are inextricably linked as intelligence is the ability to gain new information and employ it in novel contexts. The ambience is what accompanies us, while artificial represents something developed by humans. Wearable technologies are being designed to recognize FOG and support patients in the beginning to walk again via periodic cueing. The article proposes a unique automated approach for action description that utilizes AI to carry out a non-intrusive, markerless evaluation in real-time and with full robotics. This computerized method accelerates detection and safeguards from human error. Despite significant improvements brought about by the advent of novel technologies, the available assessment platforms still fail to strike the ideal equilibrium among expenditure, diagnostic precision, velocity, and simplicity. The value of the recommended approach can be seen through a comparison of the gait parameters collected by each of the motion-tracking gadgets.",2023,ai & robotics in healthcare; balance; gait assessment; gait training; parkinson’s disease,,"Jadhwani, PL; Harjpal, P"
WarpDrive: Improving spatial normalization using manual refinements.,"Spatial normalization-the process of mapping subject brain images to an average template brain-has evolved over the last 20+ years into a reliable method that facilitates the comparison of brain imaging results across patients, centers & modalities. While overall successful, sometimes, this automatic process yields suboptimal results, especially when dealing with brains with extensive neurodegeneration and atrophy patterns, or when high accuracy in specific regions is needed. Here we introduce WarpDrive, a novel tool for manual refinements of image alignment after automated registration. We show that the tool applied in a cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease who underwent deep brain stimulation surgery helps create more accurate representations of the data as well as meaningful models to explain patient outcomes. The tool is built to handle any type of 3D imaging data, also allowing refinements in high-resolution imaging, including histology and multiple modalities to precisely aggregate multiple data sources together.",2024,Deep brain stimulation; Image normalization; Interactive registration,"Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Brain Mapping; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Oxenford, S; Ríos, AS; Hollunder, B; Neudorfer, C; Boutet, A; Elias, GJB; Germann, J; Loh, A; Deeb, W; Salvato, B; Almeida, L; Foote, KD; Amaral, R; Rosenberg, PB; Tang-Wai, DF; Wolk, DA; Burke, AD; Sabbagh, MN; Salloway, S; Chakravarty, MM; Smith, GS; Lyketsos, CG; Okun, MS; Anderson, WS; Mari, Z; Ponce, FA; Lozano, A; Neumann, WJ; Al-Fatly, B; Horn, A"
Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Based on the EEG Analysis.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually hurts the central nervous system. By detecting and intervening in the early stage, AD patients could be prevented from memory loss and function decrease. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of the brain's electric action, which reflects the activity of nervous in the brain. Recent studies showed that AD patients' brain action will change in the early stage, and EEG might become a potential marker for AD's early diagnosis. To record and analyze the abnormal transformation in the brain with EEG, researchers and engineers has developed approaches to extract and analyze EEG feature. For the feature extraction, power spectrum analysis, event-related potentials (ERPs) and connectivity analysis could be as the marker for AD diagnosis. And in the feature analysis, Deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN), transfer learning (TL) and generative adversarial network (GAN) could help the automatic diagnosis of AD in the clinic. Based on above review, this article compares advantages and disadvantages of the AD diagnosis based on EEG analysis. In the discussion, different approaches for EEG analysis used in the clinic for AD patients will be introduced and compared.",2023,AD; EEG; Signal analysis; Signal feature extraction,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Electroencephalography; Neural Networks, Computer; Algorithms","Huang, R"
Abnormalities of Hippocampal Subfield and Amygdalar Nuclei Volumes and Clinical Correlates in Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia with Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior-A Pilot Study.,"(1) Background: The hippocampus (HP) and amygdala are essential structures in obsessive-compulsive behavior (OCB); however, the specific role of the HP in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and OCB remains unclear. (2) Objective: We investigated the alterations of hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in patients with bvFTD and OCB and assessed the correlations of clinical severity with hippocampal subfield and amygdalar nuclei volumes in bvFTD patients with OCB. (3) Materials and methods: Eight bvFTD patients with OCB were recruited and compared with eight age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Hippocampal subfield and amygdalar nuclei volumes were analyzed automatically using a 3T magnetic resonance image and FreeSurfer v7.1.1. All participants completed the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI). (4) Results: We observed remarkable reductions in bilateral total hippocampal volumes. Compared with the HCs, reductions in the left hippocampal subfield volume over the cornu ammonis (CA)1 body, CA2/3 body, CA4 body, granule cell layer, and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG) body, molecular layer of the HP body, and hippocampal tail were more obvious in patients with bvFTD and OCB. Right subfield volumes over the CA1 body and molecular layer of the HP body were more significantly reduced in bvFTD patients with OCB than in those in HCs. We observed no significant difference in amygdalar nuclei volume between the groups. Among patients with bvFTD and OCB, Y-BOCS score was negatively correlated with left CA2/3 body volume (",2023,MRI; amygdala; behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; hippocampus; obsessive–compulsive behavior,,"Liu, MN; Hu, LY; Tsai, CF; Hong, CJ; Chou, YH; Chang, CC; Yang, KC; You, ZH; Lau, CI"
Automatic segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in T2-FLAIR with AQUA: A comparative validation study against conventional methods.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are lesions in the white matter of the brain that are associated with cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia. The manual segmentation of WMHs is highly time-consuming and prone to intra- and inter-variability. Therefore, automatic segmentation approaches are gaining attention as a more efficient and objective means to detect and monitor WMHs. In this study, we propose AQUA, a deep learning model designed for fully automatic segmentation of WMHs from T2-FLAIR scans, which improves upon our previous study for small lesion detection and incorporating a multicenter approach. AQUA implements a two-dimensional U-Net architecture and uses patch-based training. Additionally, the network was modified to include Bottleneck Attention Module on each convolutional block of both the encoder and decoder to enhance performance for small-sized WMH. We evaluated the performance and robustness of AQUA by comparing it with five well-known supervised and unsupervised methods for automatic segmentation of WMHs (LGA, LPA, SLS, UBO, and BIANCA). To accomplish this, we tested these six methods on the MICCAI 2017 WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset, which contains MRI images from 170 elderly participants with WMHs of presumed vascular origin, and assessed their robustness across multiple sites and scanner types. The results showed that AQUA achieved superior performance in terms of spatial (Dice = 0.72) and volumetric (logAVD = 0.10) agreement with the manual segmentation compared to the other methods. While the recall and F1-score were moderate at 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, they improved to 0.75 and 0.82 when excluding small lesions (≤ 6 voxels). Remarkably, despite being trained on a different dataset with different ethnic backgrounds, lesion loads, and scanners, AQUA's results were comparable to the top 10 ranked methods of the MICCAI challenge. The findings suggest that AQUA is effective and practical for automatic segmentation of WMHs from T2-FLAIR scans, which could help identify individuals at risk of cognitive decline and dementia and allow for early intervention and management.",2023,Automatic segmentation; Comparative study; T2-FLAIR; U-Net; White matter hyperintensities,Humans; Aged; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Mental Recall; Dementia,"Lee, S; Rieu, Z; Kim, RE; Lee, M; Yen, K; Yong, J; Kim, D"

SaLSa: A Combinatory Approach of Semi-Automatic Labeling and Long Short-Term Memory to Classify Behavioral Syllables.,"Accurately and quantitatively describing mouse behavior is an important area. Although advances in machine learning have made it possible to track their behaviors accurately, reliable classification of behavioral sequences or syllables remains a challenge. In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach, called SaLSa (a combination of semi-automatic labeling and long short-term memory-based classification), to classify behavioral syllables of mice exploring an open field. This approach consists of two major steps. First, after tracking multiple body parts, spatial and temporal features of their egocentric coordinates are extracted. A fully automated unsupervised process identifies candidates for behavioral syllables, followed by manual labeling of behavioral syllables using a graphical user interface (GUI). Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier is trained with the labeled data. We found that the classification performance was marked over 97%. It provides a performance equivalent to a state-of-the-art model while classifying some of the syllables. We applied this approach to examine how hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease develops with age. When the proportion of each behavioral syllable was compared between genotypes and sexes, we found that the characteristic hyperlocomotion of female Alzheimer's disease mice emerges between four and eight months. In contrast, age-related reduction in rearing is common regardless of genotype and sex. Overall, SaLSa enables detailed characterization of mouse behavior.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aging; classification; computational ethology; deep learning; long short-term memory,"Mice; Female; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Memory, Short-Term; Memory, Long-Term","Sakata, S"

Robustly uncovering the heterogeneity of neurodegenerative disease by using data-driven subtyping in neuroimaging: A review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with heterogeneity in genetics, pathology, and clinical manifestation. Understanding this heterogeneity is particularly relevant for clinical prognosis and stratifying patients for disease modifying treatments. Recently, data-driven methods based on neuroimaging have been applied to investigate the subtyping of neurodegenerative disease, helping to disentangle this heterogeneity. We reviewed brain-based subtyping studies in aging and representative neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia, from January 2000 to November 2022. We summarized clustering methods, validation, robustness, reproducibility, and clinical relevance of 71 eligible studies in the present study. We found vast variations in approaches between studies, including ten neuroimaging modalities, 24 cluster algorithms, and 41 methods of cluster number determination. The clinical relevance of subtyping studies was evaluated by summarizing the analysis method of clinical measurements, showing a relatively low clinical utility in the current studies. Finally, we conclude that future studies of heterogeneity in neurodegenerative disease should focus on validation, comparison between subtyping approaches, and prioritise clinical utility.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Data-driven; Heterogeneity; Neurodegenerative diseases; Subtype,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Reproducibility of Results; Alzheimer Disease; Lewy Body Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuroimaging,"Chen, P; Zhang, S; Zhao, K; Kang, X; Rittman, T; Liu, Y"
A large-scale volumetric correlated light and electron microscopy study localizes Alzheimer's disease-related molecules in the hippocampus.,"Connectomics is a nascent neuroscience field to map and analyze neuronal networks. It provides a new way to investigate abnormalities in brain tissue, including in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This age-related disease is associated with alterations in amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (pTau). These alterations correlate with AD's clinical manifestations, but causal links remain unclear. Therefore, studying these molecular alterations within the context of the local neuronal and glial milieu may provide insight into disease mechanisms. Volume electron microscopy (vEM) is an ideal tool for performing connectomics studies at the ultrastructural level, but localizing specific biomolecules within large-volume vEM data has been challenging. Here we report a volumetric correlated light and electron microscopy (vCLEM) approach using fluorescent nanobodies as immuno-probes to localize Alzheimer's disease-related molecules in a large vEM volume. Three molecules (pTau, Aβ, and a marker for activated microglia (CD11b)) were labeled without the need for detergents by three nanobody probes in a sample of the hippocampus of the 3xTg Alzheimer's disease model mouse. Confocal microscopy followed by vEM imaging of the same sample allowed for registration of the location of the molecules within the volume. This dataset revealed several ultrastructural abnormalities regarding the localizations of Aβ and pTau in novel locations. For example, two pTau-positive post-synaptic spine-like protrusions innervated by axon terminals were found projecting from the axon initial segment of a pyramidal cell. Three pyramidal neurons with intracellular Aβ or pTau were 3D reconstructed. Automatic synapse detection, which is necessary for connectomics analysis, revealed the changes in density and volume of synapses at different distances from an Aβ plaque. This vCLEM approach is useful to uncover molecular alterations within large-scale volume electron microscopy data, opening a new connectomics pathway to study Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.",2023,,,"Han, X; Li, PH; Wang, S; Sanchez, M; Aggarwal, S; Blakely, T; Schalek, R; Meirovitch, Y; Lin, Z; Berger, D; Wu, Y; Aly, F; Bay, S; Delatour, B; LaFaye, P; Pfister, H; Wei, D; Jain, V; Ploegh, H; Lichtman, J"
A Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation Framework for 3D MRI Classification of Gliomas and Alzheimer's Diseases.,"Accurate and fully automated brain structure examination and prediction from 3D volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a necessary step in medical imaging analysis, which can assist greatly in clinical diagnosis. Traditional deep learning models suffer from severe performance degradation when applied to clinically acquired unlabeled data. The performance degradation is mainly caused by domain discrepancy such as different device types and parameter settings for data acquisition. However, existing approaches focus on the reduction of domain discrepancies but ignore the entanglement of semantic features and domain information. In this article, we explore the feature invariance of categories and domains in different projection spaces and propose a Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation (STDA) method using a joint optimal transport theory and contrastive learning for automatic 3D MRI classification and glioma multi-grade prediction. Specifically, the learning framework updates the distribution of features across domains and categories by Siamese transport network training with an Optimal Cost Transfer Strategy (OCTS) and a Mutual Invariant Constraint (MIC) in two projective spaces to find multiple invariants in potential heterogeneity. We design three sets of transfer task scenarios with different source and target domains, and demonstrate that STDA yields substantially higher generalization performance than other state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. The method is applicable on 3D MRI data from glioma to Alzheimer's disease and has promising applications in the future clinical diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Brain","Yu, L; Liu, J; Wu, Q; Wang, J; Qu, A"

Markov model combined with MR diffusion tensor imaging for predicting the onset of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects cognition, behavior, and memory of brain. It causes 60-80% of dementia cases. Cross-sectional imaging investigations of AD show that magnetic resonance (MR) with diffusion tensor image (DTI)-detected lesion locations in AD patients are heterogeneous and distributed across the imaging area. This study suggested that Markov model (MM) combined with MR-DTI (MM + MR-DTI) was offered as a method for predicting the onset of AD. In 120 subjects (normal controls [NCs], amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI] patients, and AD patients) from a discovery dataset and 122 subjects (NCs, aMCI, and AD) from a replicated dataset, we used them to evaluate the white matter (WM) integrity and abnormalities. We did this by using automated fiber quantification, which allowed us to identify 20 central WM tracts. Point-wise alterations in WM tracts were shown using discovery and replication datasets. The statistical analysis revealed a substantial correlation between microstructural WM alterations and output in the patient groups and cognitive performance, suggesting that this may be a potential biomarker for AD. The MR-based classifier demonstrated the following performance levels for the basis classifiers, with DTI achieving the lowest performance. The following outcomes were seen in MM + MR-DTI using multimodal techniques when combining two modalities. Finally, a combination of every imaging method produced results with an accuracy of 98%, a specificity of 97%, and a sensitivity of 99%. In summary, DTI performs better when paired with structural MR, despite its relatively weak performance when used alone. These findings support the idea that WM modifications play a significant role in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; diffusion tensor imaging; magnetic resonance; white matter,,"Lang, L; Wang, Y"
Deep Learning-Based Ensembling Technique to Classify Alzheimer's Disease Stages Using Functional MRI.,"The major issue faced by elderly people in society is the loss of memory, difficulty learning new things, and poor judgment. This is due to damage to brain tissues, which may lead to cognitive impairment and eventually Alzheimer's. Therefore, the detection of such mild cognitive impairment (MCI) becomes important. Usually, this is detected when it is converted into Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is irreversible and cannot be cured whereas mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be cured. The goal of this research is to diagnose Alzheimer's patients for timely treatment. For this purpose, functional MRI images from the publicly available dataset are used. Various deep-learning models have been used by the scientific community for the automatic detection of Alzheimer's subjects. These include the binary classification of scans of patients into MCI and AD stages, and limited work is carried out for multiclass classification of Alzheimer's disease up to six different stages. This study is divided into two steps. In the first step, a binary classification of the subject's scan is performed using Custom CNN. The second step involves the use of different deep learning models along with Custom CNN for multiclass classification of a subject's scan into one of the six stages of Alzheimer's disease. The models are evaluated based on different evaluation metrics, and the overall result of the models is improved using the max-voting ensembling technique. The experimental results show that an overall average accuracy of 98.8% is achieved for Alzheimer's stages classification.",2023,,"Humans; Aged; Deep Learning; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Cognitive Dysfunction","Tajammal, T; Khurshid, SK; Jaleel, A; Qayyum Wahla, S; Ziar, RA"

"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by joining dual attention CNN and MLP based on structural MRIs, clinical and genetic data.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible central nervous degenerative disease, while mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor state of AD. Accurate early diagnosis of AD is conducive to the prevention and early intervention treatment of AD. Although some computational methods have been developed for AD diagnosis, most employ only neuroimaging, ignoring other data (e.g., genetic, clinical) that may have potential disease information. In addition, the results of some methods lack interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel method (called DANMLP) of joining dual attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for computer-aided AD diagnosis by integrating multi-modality data of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical data (i.e., demographics, neuropsychology), and APOE genetic data. Our DANMLP consists of four primary components: (1) the Patch-CNN for extracting the image characteristics from each local patch, (2) the position self-attention block for capturing the dependencies between features within a patch, (3) the channel self-attention block for capturing dependencies of inter-patch features, (4) two MLP networks for extracting the clinical features and outputting the AD classification results, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the 5CV test, DANMLP achieves 93% and 82.4% classification accuracy for the AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC tasks on the ADNI database, which is 0.2%∼15.2% and 3.4%∼26.8% higher than that of other five methods, respectively. The individualized visualization of focal areas can also help clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD.

Early treatment in patients at high risk of severe complications is vital to prevent death and ventilator use. Predicting COVID-19 clinical outcomes using machine learning may provide a fast and data-driven solution for optimizing patient care by estimating the need for early treatment. In addition, it is essential to accurately predict risk across demographic groups, particularly those underrepresented in existing models. Unfortunately, there is a lack of studies demonstrating the equitable performance of machine learning models across patient demographics. To overcome this existing limitation, we generate a robust machine learning model to predict patient-specific risk of death or ventilator use in COVID-19 positive patients using features available at the time of diagnosis. We establish the value of our solution across patient demographics, including gender and race. In addition, we improve clinical trust in our automated predictions by generating interpretable patient clustering, patient-level clinical feature importance, and global clinical feature importance within our large real-world COVID-19 positive patient dataset. We achieved 89.38% area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) performance for severe outcomes prediction and our robust feature ranking approach identified the presence of dementia as a key indicator for worse patient outcomes. We also demonstrated that our deep-learning clustering approach outperforms traditional clustering in separating patients by severity of outcome based on mutual information performance. Finally, we developed an application for automated and fair patient risk assessment with minimal manual data entry using existing data exchange standards.",2023,,"Humans; COVID-19; Risk Assessment; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Prognosis; Machine Learning; Retrospective Studies","Giuste, FO; He, L; Lais, P; Shi, W; Zhu, Y; Hornback, A; Tsai, C; Isgut, M; Anderson, B; Wang, MD"

Genome-wide association study identifies ,"The PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for ",2023,,,"Hou, X; Heckman, MG; Fiesel, FC; Koga, S; Soto-Beasley, AI; Watzlawik, JO; Zhao, J; Valentino, RR; Johnson, PW; White, LJ; Quicksall, ZS; Reddy, JS; Bras, J; Guerreiro, R; Zhao, N; Bu, G; Dickson, DW; Ross, OA; Springer, W"

Required improvements for cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarker tests of Alzheimer's disease.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers represent a well-established tool for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD), independently from the clinical stage, by reflecting the presence of brain amyloidosis (A+) and tauopathy (T+). In front of this important achievement, so far, (i) CSF AD biomarkers have not yet been adopted for routine clinical use in all Centers dedicated to AD, mainly due to inter-lab variation and lack of internationally accepted cutoff values; (ii) we do need to add other biomarkers more suitable to correlate with the clinical stage and disease monitoring; (iii) we also need to detect the co-presence of other 'non-AD' pathologies.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; algorithms; biomarker; cerebrospinal fluid; diagnosis; personalized medicine; precision medicine; prognosis,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloidosis; Brain; Biomarkers,"Gaetani, L; Chiasserini, D; Paolini Paoletti, F; Bellomo, G; Parnetti, L"

Automatic selection of spoken language biomarkers for dementia detection.,"This paper analyzes diverse features extracted from spoken language to select the most discriminative ones for dementia detection. We present a two-step feature selection (FS) approach: Step 1 utilizes filter methods to pre-screen features, and Step 2 uses a novel feature ranking (FR) method, referred to as dual dropout ranking (DDR), to rank the screened features and select spoken language biomarkers. The proposed DDR is based on a dual-net architecture that separates FS and dementia detection into two neural networks (namely, the operator and selector). The operator is trained on features obtained from the selector to reduce classification or regression loss. The selector is optimized to predict the operator's performance based on automatic regularization. Results show that the approach significantly reduces feature dimensionality while identifying small feature subsets that achieve comparable or superior performance compared with the full, default feature set.

A novel cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network framework with spatial self-attention mechanism for hippocampus segmentation.,"Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from the brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a crucial task in the neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus structures is challenging due to the small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries of hippocampus. Although some methods have been developed for the hippocampus segmentation, most of them paid too much attention to the hippocampus shape and volume instead of considering the spatial information. Additionally, the extracted features are independent of each other, ignoring the correlation between the global and local information. In view of this, here we proposed a novel cross-layer dual Encoding-Shared Decoding network framework with Spatial self-Attention mechanism (called ESDSA) for hippocampus segmentation in human brains. Considering that the hippocampus is a relatively small part in MRI, we introduced the spatial self-attention mechanism in ESDSA to capture the spatial information of hippocampus for improving the segmentation accuracy. We also designed a cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network to effectively extract the global information of MRIs and the spatial information of hippocampus. The spatial features of hippocampus and the features extracted from the MRIs were combined to realize the hippocampus segmentation. Results on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data show that the performance of our ESDSA is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and the dice similarity coefficient of ESDSA achieves 89.37%. In addition, the dice similarity coefficient of the Spatial Self-Attention mechanism (SSA) strategy and the dual Encoding-Shared Decoding (ESD) strategy is 9.47%, 5.35% higher than that of the baseline U-net, respectively, indicating that the strategies of SSA and ESD can effectively enhance the segmentation accuracy of human brain hippocampus.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Dual encoding-shared decoding network; Hippocampus segmentation; Magnetic resonance images; Spatial self-attention mechanism,"Humans; Hippocampus; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Neuroimaging; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Li, JN; Zhang, SW; Qiang, YR; Zhou, QY"
[Alzheimer's disease classification based on nonlinear high-order features and hypergraph convolutional neural network].,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that damages patients' memory and cognitive abilities. Therefore, the diagnosis of AD holds significant importance. The interactions between regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain often involve multiple areas collaborating in a nonlinear manner. Leveraging these nonlinear higher-order interaction features to their fullest potential contributes to enhancing the accuracy of AD diagnosis. To address this, a framework combining nonlinear higher-order feature extraction and three-dimensional (3D) hypergraph neural networks is proposed for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD. First, a support vector machine regression model based on the radial basis function kernel was trained on ROI data to obtain a base estimator. Then, a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the base estimator was applied to extract nonlinear higher-order features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These features were subsequently constructed into a hypergraph, leveraging the complex interactions captured in the data. Finally, a four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal hypergraph convolutional neural network model was constructed based on the fMRI data for classification. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the Hyper Graph Convolutional Network (HyperGCN) framework by 8% and traditional two-dimensional (2D) linear feature extraction methods by 12% in the AD/normal control (NC) classification task. In conclusion, this framework demonstrates an improvement in AD classification compared to mainstream deep learning methods, providing valuable evidence for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Classification; Functional magnetic resonance imaging data; Hypergraph convolutional neural network; Nonlinear high-order features; Region of interest,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction","Zeng, A; Luo, B; Pan, D; Rong, H; Cao, J; Zhang, X; Lin, J; Yang, Y; Liu, J"
Attentive pairwise interaction network for AI-assisted clock drawing test assessment of early visuospatial deficits.,"Dementia is a debilitating neurological condition which impairs the cognitive function and the ability to take care of oneself. The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is widely used to detect dementia, but differentiating normal from borderline cases requires years of clinical experience. Misclassifying mild abnormal as normal will delay the chance to investigate for potential reversible causes or slow down the progression. To help address this issue, we propose an automatic CDT scoring system that adopts Attentive Pairwise Interaction Network (API-Net), a fine-grained deep learning model that is designed to distinguish visually similar images. Inspired by how humans often learn to recognize different objects by looking at two images side-by-side, API-Net is optimized using image pairs in a contrastive manner, as opposed to standard supervised learning, which optimizes a model using individual images. In this study, we extend API-Net to infer Shulman CDT scores from a dataset of 3108 subjects. We compare the performance of API-Net to that of convolutional neural networks: VGG16, ResNet-152, and DenseNet-121. The best API-Net achieves an F1-score of 0.79, which is a 3% absolute improvement over ResNet-152's F1-score of 0.76.

Choking in patients with neurological disorders and role of drug-induced dysphagia.,"Choking is a type of asphyxia due to the internal obstruction of airways by foreign material, quite always food. Most choking deaths are accidental and occur so quickly that may mimic a heart attack. This scenario is also known as ""Cafè coronary syndrome"" or ""bolus death"". At autopsy, pieces of under-chewed food are commonly lodged at, above, or in the tracheal space adjacent to the laryngeal inlet. In these fatal events mechanisms other than asphyxia can be also involved, such as a vasovagal episode (by stimulation of the autonomic nerve plexus of the laryngeal inlet) or swallowing impairment. Swallowing is a complex, semi-automatic process that can be affected by various disorders (i.e. dementia, Parkinson, neurological injuries, etc.), senility and external factors causing oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD). Among these factors, several drugs have been also associated with impaired swallowing, including drugs acting on the CNS like antipsychotics and antiepileptics. Three cases of witnessed bolus deaths are reported. All victims were affected by neurological defects and took medications acting on CNS. In all cases, at autopsy pieces of food were found distributed from the laryngeal inlet along the main axis of the trachea up to the large bronchi over the bifurcation. Additional autopsy findings were represented by facial congestion and cyanosis, subepicardial petechiae and pulmonary emphysema.",2024,Cafè coronary syndrome; Choking; Drug-induced dysphagia,Humans; Deglutition Disorders; Airway Obstruction; Male; Female; Autopsy; Nervous System Diseases; Aged; Middle Aged,"Feola, A; Ciamarra, P; Cavezza, A; Carfora, A; Campobasso, CP"

Combination of deep learning and 2D CARS figures for identification of amyloid-β plaques.,"In vivo imaging and accurate identification of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque are crucial in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. In this work, we propose to combine the coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, a powerful detection technology for providing Raman spectra and label-free imaging, with deep learning to distinguish Aβ from non-Aβ regions in AD mice brains in vivo. The 1D CARS spectra is firstly converted to 2D CARS figures by using two different methods: spectral recurrence plot (SRP) and spectral Gramian angular field (SGAF). This can provide more learnable information to the network, improving the classification precision. We then devise a cross-stage attention network (CSAN) that automatically learns the features of Aβ plaques and non-Aβ regions by taking advantage of the computational advances in deep learning. Our algorithm yields higher accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity than the results of conventional multivariate statistical analysis method and 1D CARS spectra combined with deep learning, demonstrating its competence in identifying Aβ plaques. Last but not least, the CSAN framework requires no prior information on the imaging modality and may be applicable to other spectroscopy analytical fields.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Deep Learning; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Nonlinear Optical Microscopy; Plaque, Amyloid; Brain","Luo, Z; Zhu, G; Xu, H; Lin, D; Li, J; Qu, J"

This study focuses on the application of radiomics, an advanced imaging analysis technique, combined with automated machine learning to predict BAG. Our methods achieve a promising result with a mean absolute error of 1.509 using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Furthermore, we find that the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus play a significant role in predicting age with interpretable method called SHapley Additive exPlanations. Additionally, our investigation of age prediction discrepancies between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) reveals a notable correlation with clinical cognitive assessment scale scores. This suggests that BAG has the potential to serve as a biomarker to support the diagnosis of AD and MCI. Overall, this study presents valuable insights into the application of neuroimaging models in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,Alzheimer’S disease; Automated machine learning; Brain age; Radiomics; Shapley additive explanations,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Aged; Machine Learning; Neuroimaging; Female; Male; Brain; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Radiomics","Guo, X; Ding, Y; Xu, W; Wang, D; Yu, H; Lin, Y; Chang, S; Zhang, Q; Zhang, Y"
Associations of Perceived Stress and Psychological Resilience With Cognition and a Modifiable Dementia Risk Score in Middle-Aged Adults.,"Psychological stress has been proposed as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, it remains unclear how an individual's stress-coping ability (i.e., psychological resilience) is related to cognition. This cross-sectional study investigated whether perceived stress and psychological resilience were associated with cognition and a modifiable dementia risk score in a large community-based sample of cognitively normal adults.

Improving Alzheimer Diagnoses With An Interpretable Deep Learning Framework: Including Neuropsychiatric Symptoms.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive cognitive decline. Among the various clinical symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) commonly occur during the course of AD. Previous researches have demonstrated a strong association between NPS and severity of AD, while the research methods are not sufficiently intuitive. Here, we report a hybrid deep learning framework for AD diagnosis using multimodal inputs such as structural MRI, behavioral scores, age, and gender information. The framework uses a 3D convolutional neural network to automatically extract features from MRI. The imaging features are passed to the Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, which fuse with non-imaging information to improve the diagnosis of AD. According to the experimental results, our model achieves an accuracy of 0.91 and an area under the curve of 0.97 in the task of classifying AD and cognitively normal individuals. SHapley Additive exPlanations are used to visually exhibit the contribution of specific NPS in the proposed model. Among all behavioral symptoms, apathy plays a particularly important role in the diagnosis of AD, which can be considered a valuable factor in further studies, as well as clinical trials.",2023,3D CNN; Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; neuropsychiatric symptoms; structural MRI,"Humans; Deep Learning; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuroimaging","Liu, S; Zheng, Y; Li, H; Pan, M; Fang, Z; Liu, M; Qiao, Y; Pan, N; Jia, W; Ge, X"

Classification of Alzheimer's disease stages from magnetic resonance images using deep learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive type of dementia characterized by loss of memory and other cognitive abilities, including speech. Since AD is a progressive disease, detection in the early stages is essential for the appropriate care of the patient throughout its development, going from asymptomatic to a stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then progressing to dementia and severe dementia; is worth mentioning that everyone suffers from cognitive impairment to some degree as we age, but the relevant task here is to identify which people are most likely to develop AD. Along with cognitive tests, evaluation of the brain morphology is the primary tool for AD diagnosis, where atrophy and loss of volume of the frontotemporal lobe are common features in patients who suffer from the disease. Regarding medical imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are one of the methods used by specialists to assess brain morphology. Recently, with the rise of deep learning (DL) and its successful implementation in medical imaging applications, it is of growing interest in the research community to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems that can help physicians to detect this disease, especially in the early stages where macroscopic changes are not so easily identified. This article presents a DL-based approach to classifying MRI scans in the different stages of AD, using a curated set of images from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies databases. Our methodology involves image pre-processing using FreeSurfer, spatial data-augmentation operations, such as rotation, flip, and random zoom during training, and state-of-the-art 3D convolutional neural networks such as EfficientNet, DenseNet, and a custom siamese network, as well as the relatively new approach of vision transformer architecture. With this approach, the best detection percentage among all four architectures was around 89% for AD ",2023,Computer-aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Digital image processing; Supervised learning,,"Mora-Rubio, A; Bravo-Ortíz, MA; Quiñones Arredondo, S; Saborit Torres, JM; Ruz, GA; Tabares-Soto, R"
DE-JANet: A unified network based on dual encoder and joint attention for Alzheimer's disease classification using multi-modal data.,"Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), which can reflect cerebral atrophy, plays an important role in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the information provided by analyzing only the morphological changes in sMRI is relatively limited, and the assessment of the atrophy degree is subjective. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine sMRI with other clinical information to acquire complementary diagnosis information and achieve a more accurate classification of AD. Nevertheless, how to fuse these multi-modal data effectively is still challenging. In this paper, we propose DE-JANet, a unified AD classification network that integrates image data sMRI with non-image clinical data, such as age and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, for more effective multi-modal analysis. DE-JANet consists of three key components: (1) a dual encoder module for extracting low-level features from the image and non-image data according to specific encoding regularity, (2) a joint attention module for fusing multi-modal features, and (3) a token classification module for performing AD-related classification according to the fused multi-modal features. Our DE-JANet is evaluated on the ADNI dataset, with a mean accuracy of 0.9722 and 0.9538 for AD classification and mild cognition impairment (MCI) classification, respectively, which is superior to existing methods and indicates advanced performance on AD-related diagnosis tasks.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Convolutional neural network; Joint attention; Multi-modal data,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Dai, Y; Zou, B; Zhu, C; Li, Y; Chen, Z; Ji, Z; Kui, X; Zhang, W"
Effects of de-facing software mri_reface on utility of imaging biomarkers used in Alzheimer's disease research.,"Brain imaging research studies increasingly use ""de-facing"" software to remove or replace facial imagery before public data sharing. Several works have studied the effects of de-facing software on brain imaging biomarkers by directly comparing automated measurements from unmodified vs de-faced images, but most research brain images are used in analyses of correlations with cognitive measurements or clinical statuses, and the effects of de-facing on these types of imaging-to-cognition correlations has not been measured. In this work, we focused on brain imaging measures of amyloid (A), tau (T), neurodegeneration (N), and vascular (V) measures used in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research. We created a retrospective sample of participants from three age- and sex-matched clinical groups (cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia, and we performed region- and voxel-wise analyses of: hippocampal volume (N), white matter hyperintensity volume (V), amyloid PET (A), and tau PET (T) measures, each from multiple software pipelines, on their ability to separate cognitively defined groups and their degrees of correlation with age and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). We performed each of these analyses twice: once with unmodified images and once with images de-faced with leading de-facing software mri_reface, and we directly compared the findings and their statistical strengths between the original vs. the de-faced images. Analyses with original and with de-faced images had very high agreement. There were no significant differences between any voxel-wise comparisons. Among region-wise comparisons, only three out of 55 correlations were significantly different between original and de-faced images, and these were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Overall, the statistical power of the imaging data for AD biomarkers was almost identical between unmodified and de-faced images, and their analyses results were extremely consistent.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Anonymization; De-facing; De-identification; Face recognition,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Retrospective Studies; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; tau Proteins,"Schwarz, CG; Kremers, WK; Weigand, SD; Prakaashana, CM; Senjem, ML; Przybelski, SA; Lowe, VJ; Gunter, JL; Kantarci, K; Vemuri, P; Graff-Radford, J; Petersen, RC; Knopman, DS; Jack, CR"
Development and multi-center validation of a fully automated digital immunoassay for neurofilament light chain: toward a clinical blood test for neuronal injury.,"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) has emerged as a promising biomarker for detecting and monitoring axonal injury. Until recently, NfL could only be reliably measured in cerebrospinal fluid, but digital single molecule array (Simoa) technology has enabled its precise measurement in blood samples where it is typically 50-100 times less abundant.

Dynamic functional connectivity MEG features of Alzheimer's disease.,"Dynamic resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) characterizes time-varying fluctuations of functional brain network activity. While many studies have investigated static functional connectivity, it has been unclear whether features of dynamic functional connectivity are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Popular sliding-window and clustering methods for extracting dynamic RSFC have various limitations that prevent extracting reliable features to address this question. Here, we use a novel and robust time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) approach to extract the dynamic RSFC features from high resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and matched controls. The TVDN algorithm automatically and adaptively learns the low-dimensional spatiotemporal manifold of dynamic RSFC and detects dynamic state transitions in data. We show that amongst all the functional features we investigated, the dynamic manifold features are the most predictive of AD. These include: the temporal complexity of the brain network, given by the number of state transitions and their dwell times, and the spatial complexity of the brain network, given by the number of eigenmodes. These dynamic features have higher sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing AD from healthy subjects than the existing benchmarks do. Intriguingly, we found that AD patients generally have higher spatial complexity but lower temporal complexity compared with healthy controls. We also show that graph theoretic metrics of dynamic component of TVDN are significantly different in AD versus controls, while static graph metrics are not statistically different. These results indicate that dynamic RSFC features are impacted in neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease, and may be crucial to understanding the pathophysiological trajectory of these diseases.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Brain state switch; Dementia; Dynamic resting state; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance; Magnetoencephalography; Multi-modality imaging,Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain,"Jin, H; Ranasinghe, KG; Prabhu, P; Dale, C; Gao, Y; Kudo, K; Vossel, K; Raj, A; Nagarajan, SS; Jiang, F"
Usability and Acceptability of Social Robot Pets Among Community-Dwelling Veterans Living With Dementia and Their Caregivers.,"Social robot pets promote engagement and psychosocial well-being among older adults, yet little is known about their use among community-dwelling Veterans living with dementia. This programmatic evaluation used a within subjects, pre-post design to examine the usability (frequency of use, frequency of caregiver reminders) and acceptability (benefit, satisfaction) of social robot pets among Veterans with dementia (N = 20). An intervention usability and acceptability tool was completed by telephone with family caregivers 3 months after delivery of the pet to the home. Overall, 80% of Veterans used the pet often or daily, while 7 caregivers provided reminders for the Veteran to use the pet. Caregivers indicated that Veterans experienced benefit with the pet, as well themselves. Regarding satisfaction, 89% reported they would recommend a social robot pet to others. Research is needed to expand generalizability, evaluate effects on outcomes, and enhance implementation of social robot pets among Veteran families with dementia.",2023,caregiver; dementia; intervention; non-pharmacologic; pet; robots,Humans; Aged; Caregivers; Dementia; Veterans; Robotics; Independent Living; Social Interaction,"Harris-Gersten, ML; Davagnino, JM; Alcorn, ER; Hastings, SN"
ADscreen: A speech processing-based screening system for automatic identification of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11 % of older adults in the United States. Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of patients with ADRD, >50 % of them are not diagnosed and unaware of their disease. To address this challenge, we developed ADscreen, an innovative speech-processing based ADRD screening algorithm for the protective identification of patients with ADRD. ADscreen consists of five major components: (i) noise reduction for reducing background noises from the audio-recorded patient speech, (ii) modeling the patient's ability in phonetic motor planning using acoustic parameters of the patient's voice, (iii) modeling the patient's ability in semantic and syntactic levels of language organization using linguistic parameters of the patient speech, (iv) extracting vocal and semantic psycholinguistic cues from the patient speech, and (v) building and evaluating the screening algorithm. To identify important speech parameters (features) associated with ADRD, we used the Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM), an effective feature selection method for high dimensional, small sample size datasets. Modeling the relationship between speech parameters and the outcome variable (presence/absence of ADRD) was conducted using three different machine learning (ML) architectures with the capability of joining informative acoustic and linguistic with contextual word embedding vectors obtained from the DistilBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We evaluated the performance of the ADscreen on an audio-recorded patients' speech (verbal description) for the Cookie-Theft picture description task, which is publicly available in the dementia databank. The joint fusion of acoustic and linguistic parameters with contextual word embedding vectors of DistilBERT achieved F1-score = 84.64 (standard deviation [std] = ±3.58) and AUC-ROC = 92.53 (std = ±3.34) for training dataset, and F1-score = 89.55 and AUC-ROC = 93.89 for the test dataset. In summary, ADscreen has a strong potential to be integrated with clinical workflow to address the need for an ADRD screening tool so that patients with cognitive impairment can receive appropriate and timely care.",2023,Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Screening algorithm; Speech analysis,Aged; Humans; Acoustics; Alzheimer Disease; Linguistics; Speech; Mass Screening,"Zolnoori, M; Zolnour, A; Topaz, M"
Clinically-Inspired Multi-Agent Transformers for Disease Trajectory Forecasting From Multimodal Data.,"Deep neural networks are often applied to medical images to automate the problem of medical diagnosis. However, a more clinically relevant question that practitioners usually face is how to predict the future trajectory of a disease. Current methods for prognosis or disease trajectory forecasting often require domain knowledge and are complicated to apply. In this paper, we formulate the prognosis prediction problem as a one-to-many prediction problem. Inspired by a clinical decision-making process with two agents-a radiologist and a general practitioner - we predict prognosis with two transformer-based components that share information with each other. The first transformer in this framework aims to analyze the imaging data, and the second one leverages its internal states as inputs, also fusing them with auxiliary clinical data. The temporal nature of the problem is modeled within the transformer states, allowing us to treat the forecasting problem as a multi-task classification, for which we propose a novel loss. We show the effectiveness of our approach in predicting the development of structural knee osteoarthritis changes and forecasting Alzheimer's disease clinical status directly from raw multi-modal data. The proposed method outperforms multiple state-of-the-art baselines with respect to performance and calibration, both of which are needed for real-world applications.

Unsupervised contrastive graph learning for resting-state functional MRI analysis and brain disorder detection.,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) helps characterize regional interactions that occur in the human brain at a resting state. Existing research often attempts to explore fMRI biomarkers that best predict brain disease progression using machine/deep learning techniques. Previous fMRI studies have shown that learning-based methods usually require a large amount of labeled training data, limiting their utility in clinical practice where annotating data is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To this end, we propose an unsupervised contrastive graph learning (UCGL) framework for fMRI-based brain disease analysis, in which a pretext model is designed to generate informative fMRI representations using unlabeled training data, followed by model fine-tuning to perform downstream disease identification tasks. Specifically, in the pretext model, we first design a bi-level fMRI augmentation strategy to increase the sample size by augmenting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, and then employ two parallel graph convolutional networks for fMRI feature extraction in an unsupervised contrastive learning manner. This pretext model can be optimized on large-scale fMRI datasets, without requiring labeled training data. This model is further fine-tuned on to-be-analyzed fMRI data for downstream disease detection in a task-oriented learning manner. We evaluate the proposed method on three rs-fMRI datasets for cross-site and cross-dataset learning tasks. Experimental results suggest that the UCGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in automated diagnosis of three brain diseases (i.e., major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease) with rs-fMRI data.",2023,brain disorder; data augmentation; fine-tuning; functional MRI; small-sample-size,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Rest; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease","Wang, X; Chu, Y; Wang, Q; Cao, L; Qiao, L; Zhang, L; Liu, M"

Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption and Perivascular Spaces in Small Vessel Disease and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review on MRI Methods and Insights.,"Perivascular spaces (PVS) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption are two key features of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and neurodegenerative diseases that have been linked to cognitive impairment and are involved in the cerebral waste clearance system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers the possibility to study these pathophysiological processes noninvasively in vivo. This educational review provides an overview of the MRI techniques used to assess PVS functionality and BBB disruption. MRI-visible PVS can be scored on structural images by either (subjectively) counting or (automatically) delineating the PVS. We highlight emerging (diffusion) techniques to measure proxies of perivascular fluid and its movement, which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of PVS in diseases. For the measurement of BBB disruption, we explain the most commonly used MRI technique, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, as well as a more recently developed technique based on arterial spin labeling (ASL). DCE MRI and ASL are thought to measure complementary characteristics of the BBB. Furthermore, we describe clinical studies that have utilized these MRI techniques in cSVD and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). These studies demonstrate the role of PVS and BBB dysfunction in these diseases and provide insight into the large overlap, but also into the differences between cSVD and AD. Overall, MRI techniques may provide valuable insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these diseases and have the potential to be used as markers for disease progression and treatment response.

Validating ASHS-T1 automated entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical segmentation in Alzheimer's disease.,"The current study aimed to validate entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes measured by the automated segmentation tool Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS-T1). The study sample comprised 34 healthy controls (HCs), 37 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 29 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes were assessed using ASHS-T1, manual segmentation, as well as a widely used automated segmentation tool, FreeSurfer v6.0.1. Mean differences, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Bland-Altman plots were computed. ASHS-T1 tended to underestimate entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes relative to manual segmentation and FreeSurfer. There was variable consistency and low agreement between ASHS-T1 and manual segmentation volumes. There was low-to-moderate consistency and low agreement between ASHS-T1 and FreeSurfer volumes. There was a trend toward higher consistency and agreement for the entorhinal cortex in the aMCI and AD groups compared to the HC group. Despite the differences in volume measurements, ASHS-T1 was sensitive to entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical atrophy in both early and late disease stages. Based on the current study, ASHS-T1 appears to be a promising tool for automated entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volume measurement in individuals with likely underlying AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Automated segmentation; Entorhinal cortex; Magnetic resonance imaging; Manual segmentation; Transentorhinal cortex,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Entorhinal Cortex","Quek, YE; Bourgeat, P; Fung, YL; Vogrin, SJ; Collins, SJ; Bowden, SC"
Naïve Bayes classifier assisted automated detection of cerebral microbleeds in susceptibility-weighted imaging brain images.,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in the brain are the essential indicators of critical brain disorders such as dementia and ischemic stroke. Generally, CMBs are detected manually by experts, which is an exhaustive task with limited productivity. Since CMBs have complex morphological nature, manual detection is prone to errors. This paper presents a machine learning-based automated CMB detection technique in the brain susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) scans based on statistical feature extraction and classification. The proposed method consists of three steps: (1) removal of the skull and extraction of the brain; (2) thresholding for the extraction of initial candidates; and (3) extracting features and applying classification models such as random forest and naïve Bayes classifiers for the detection of true positive CMBs.

"Microglial morphometric analysis: so many options, so little consistency.","Quantification of microglial activation through morphometric analysis has long been a staple of the neuroimmunologist's toolkit. Microglial morphological phenomics can be conducted through either manual classification or constructing a digital skeleton and extracting morphometric data from it. Multiple open-access and paid software packages are available to generate these skeletons via semi-automated and/or fully automated methods with varying degrees of accuracy. Despite advancements in methods to generate morphometrics (quantitative measures of cellular morphology), there has been limited development of tools to analyze the datasets they generate, in particular those containing parameters from tens of thousands of cells analyzed by fully automated pipelines. In this review, we compare and critique the approaches using cluster analysis and machine learning driven predictive algorithms that have been developed to tackle these large datasets, and propose improvements for these methods. In particular, we highlight the need for a commitment to ",2023,cellular morphological changes; hierarchical cluster analysis; machine learning; microglia; microglia morphology; neuroimmune methods,,"Reddaway, J; Richardson, PE; Bevan, RJ; Stoneman, J; Palombo, M"
Novel Screening Tool Using Non-linguistic Voice Features Derived from Simple Phrases to Detect Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.,"Appropriate intervention and care in detecting cognitive impairment early are essential to effectively prevent the progression of cognitive deterioration. Diagnostic voice analysis is a noninvasive and inexpensive screening method that could be useful for detecting cognitive deterioration at earlier stages such as mild cognitive impairment. We aimed to distinguish between patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls by using purely acoustic features (i.e., nonlinguistic features) extracted from two simple phrases. Voice was analyzed on 195 recordings from 150 patients (age, 45-95 years). We applied a machine learning algorithm (LightGBM; Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) to test whether the healthy control, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia groups could be accurately classified, based on acoustic features. Our algorithm performed well: area under the curve was 0.81 and accuracy, 66.7% for the 3-class classification. Thus, our vocal biomarker is useful for automated assistance in diagnosing early cognitive deterioration.",2023,Mild cognitive impairment; cognitive disorders; diagnosis; machine learning; vocal biomarker,,"Mizuguchi, D; Yamamoto, T; Omiya, Y; Endo, K; Tano, K; Oya, M; Takano, S"
Segmenting white matter hyperintensities on isotropic three-dimensional Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery magnetic resonance images: Assessing deep learning tools on a Norwegian imaging database.,"An important step in the analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for neuroimaging is the automated segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR-weighted) is an MRI contrast that is particularly useful to visualize and quantify WMHs, a hallmark of cerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to achieve high spatial resolution in each of the three voxel dimensions, clinical MRI protocols are evolving to a three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR-weighted acquisition. The current study details the deployment of deep learning tools to enable automated WMH segmentation and characterization from 3D FLAIR-weighted images acquired as part of a national AD imaging initiative. Based on data from the ongoing Norwegian Disease Dementia Initiation (DDI) multicenter study, two 3D models-one off-the-shelf from the NVIDIA nnU-Net framework and the other internally developed-were trained, validated, and tested. A third cutting-edge Deep Bayesian network model (HyperMapp3r) was implemented without any de-novo tuning to serve as a comparison architecture. The 2.5D in-house developed and 3D nnU-Net models were trained and validated in-house across five national collection sites among 441 participants from the DDI study, of whom 194 were men and whose average age was (64.91 +/- 9.32) years. Both an external dataset with 29 cases from a global collaborator and a held-out subset of the internal data from the 441 participants were used to test all three models. These test sets were evaluated independently. The ground truth human-in-the-loop segmentation was compared against five established WMH performance metrics. The 3D nnU-Net had the highest performance out of the three tested networks, outperforming both the internally developed 2.5D model and the SOTA Deep Bayesian network with an average dice similarity coefficient score of 0.76 +/- 0.16. Our findings demonstrate that WMH segmentation models can achieve high performance when trained exclusively on FLAIR input volumes that are 3D volumetric acquisitions. Single image input models are desirable for ease of deployment, as reflected in the current embedded clinical research project. The 3D nnU-Net had the highest performance, which suggests a way forward for our need to automate WMH segmentation while also evaluating performance metrics during on-going data collection and model retraining.",2023,,Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Female; Bayes Theorem; Deep Learning; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Leukoaraiosis; Alzheimer Disease,"Røvang, MS; Selnes, P; MacIntosh, BJ; Rasmus Groote, I; Pålhaugen, L; Sudre, C; Fladby, T; Bjørnerud, A"
Qualitative Evaluation of Family Caregivers' Experiences Participating in Knowledge and Interpersonal Skills to Develop Exemplary Relationships (KINDER): Web-Based Intervention to Improve Relationship Quality.,"The onset of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) can alter relationships between family caregivers and persons living with AD/ADRD, such as through the occurrence of distressful behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

Mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of deep gray matter and white matter using diffusion weighted images in premanifest and manifest Huntington's disease.,"Changes in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) begin years before clinical onset, so it remains critical to identify biomarkers to track these early changes. Metrics derived from tensor modeling of diffusion-weighted MRIs (DTI), that indicate the microscopic brain structure, can add important information to regional volumetric measurements. This study uses two large-scale longitudinal, multicenter datasets, PREDICT-HD and IMAGE-HD, to trace changes in DTI of HD participants with a broad range of CAP scores (a product of CAG repeat expansion and age), including those with pre-manifest disease (i.e., prior to clinical onset). Utilizing a fully automated data-driven approach to study the whole brain divided in regions of interest, we traced changes in DTI metrics (diffusivity and fractional anisotropy) versus CAP scores, using sigmoidal and linear regression models. We identified points of inflection in the sigmoidal regression using change-point analysis. The deep gray matter showed more evident and earlier changes in DTI metrics over CAP scores, compared to the deep white matter. In the deep white matter, these changes were more evident and occurred earlier in superior and posterior areas, compared to anterior and inferior areas. The curves of mean diffusivity vs. age of HD participants within a fixed CAP score were different from those of controls, indicating that the disease has an additional effect to age on the microscopic brain structure. These results show the regional and temporal vulnerability of the white matter and deep gray matter in HD, with potential implications for experimental therapeutics.",2023,Cross-sectional; DTI; Huntington's disease; Longitudinal; MRI,Humans; White Matter; Huntington Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Gray Matter; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Brain,"Hu, B; Younes, L; Bu, X; Liu, CF; Ratnanather, JT; Paulsen, J; Georgiou-Karistianis, N; Miller, MI; Ross, C; Faria, AV"

The Objective Dementia Severity Scale Based on MRI with Contrastive Learning: A Whole Brain Neuroimaging Perspective.,"In the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, one of the most important tasks is evaluating its severity for diagnosis and therapy. However, traditional testing methods are deficient, such as their susceptibility to subjective factors, incomplete evaluation, low accuracy, or insufficient granularity, resulting in unreliable evaluation scores. To address these issues, we propose an objective dementia severity scale based on MRI (ODSS-MRI) using contrastive learning to automatically evaluate the neurological function of patients. The approach utilizes a deep learning framework and a contrastive learning strategy to mine relevant information from structural magnetic resonance images to obtain the patient's neurological function level score. Given that the model is driven by the patient's whole brain imaging data, but without any possible biased manual intervention or instruction from the physician or patient, it provides a comprehensive and objective evaluation of the patient's neurological function. We conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and the results showed that the proposed ODSS-MRI was correlated with the stages of AD 88.55% better than all existing methods. This demonstrates its efficacy to describe the neurological function changes of patients during AD progression. It also outperformed traditional psychiatric rating scales in discriminating different stages of AD, which is indicative of its superiority for neurological function evaluation.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; contrastive learning; disease evaluation; medical robots,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain,"Zhang, Y; Fan, W; Chen, X; Li, W"

Automated analysis of written language in the three variants of primary progressive aphasia.,"Despite the important role of written language in everyday life, abnormalities in functional written communication have been sparsely investigated in primary progressive aphasia. Prior studies have analysed written language separately in each of the three variants of primary progressive aphasia-but have rarely compared them to each other or to spoken language. Manual analysis of written language can be a time-consuming process. We therefore developed a program that quantifies content units and total units in written or transcribed language samples. We analysed written and spoken descriptions of the Western Aphasia Battery picnic scene, based on a predefined content unit corpus. We calculated the ratio of content units to units as a measure of content density. Our cohort included 115 participants (20 controls for written, 20 controls for spoken, 28 participants with nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia, 30 for logopenic variant and 17 for semantic variant).

PFP-HOG: Pyramid and Fixed-Size Patch-Based HOG Technique for Automated Brain Abnormality Classification with MRI.,"Detecting neurological abnormalities such as brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images is an important research topic in the literature. Numerous machine learning models have been used to detect brain abnormalities accurately. This study addresses the problem of detecting neurological abnormalities in MRI. The motivation behind this problem lies in the need for accurate and efficient methods to assist neurologists in the diagnosis of these disorders. In addition, many deep learning techniques have been applied to MRI to develop accurate brain abnormality detection models, but these networks have high time complexity. Hence, a novel hand-modeled feature-based learning network is presented to reduce the time complexity and obtain high classification performance. The model proposed in this work uses a new feature generation architecture named pyramid and fixed-size patch (PFP). The main aim of the proposed PFP structure is to attain high classification performance using essential feature extractors with both multilevel and local features. Furthermore, the PFP feature extractor generates low- and high-level features using a handcrafted extractor. To obtain the high discriminative feature extraction ability of the PFP, we have used histogram-oriented gradients (HOG); hence, it is named PFP-HOG. Furthermore, the iterative Chi2 (IChi2) is utilized to choose the clinically significant features. Finally, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) with tenfold cross-validation is used for automated classification. Four MRI neurological databases (AD dataset, brain tumor dataset 1, brain tumor dataset 2, and merged dataset) have been utilized to develop our model. PFP-HOG and IChi2-based models attained 100%, 94.98%, 98.19%, and 97.80% using the AD dataset, brain tumor dataset1, brain tumor dataset 2, and merged brain MRI dataset, respectively. These findings not only provide an accurate and robust classification of various neurological disorders using MRI but also hold the potential to assist neurologists in validating manual MRI brain abnormality screening.",2023,Biomedical image processing; Brain MRI; Computer vision; HOG; Pyramid and fixed-size patch feature extraction,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Alzheimer Disease,"Kaplan, E; Chan, WY; Altinsoy, HB; Baygin, M; Barua, PD; Chakraborty, S; Dogan, S; Tuncer, T; Acharya, UR"
A fully automated home cage for long-term continuous phenotyping of mouse cognition and behavior.,"Automated home-cage monitoring systems present a valuable tool for comprehensive phenotyping of natural behaviors. However, current systems often involve complex training routines, water or food restriction, and probe a limited range of behaviors. Here, we present a fully automated home-cage monitoring system for cognitive and behavioral phenotyping in mice. The system incorporates T-maze alternation, novel object recognition, and object-in-place recognition tests combined with monitoring of locomotion, drinking, and quiescence patterns, all carried out over long periods. Mice learn the tasks rapidly without any need for water or food restrictions. Behavioral characterization employs a deep convolutional neural network image analysis. We show that combined statistical properties of multiple behaviors can be used to discriminate between mice with hippocampal, medial entorhinal, and sham lesions and predict the genotype of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model with high accuracy. This technology may enable large-scale behavioral screening for genes and neural circuits underlying spatial memory and other cognitive processes.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; automated classification; home-cage system; longitudinal monitoring; machine learning; mouse behavioural cognitive testing,"Mice; Animals; Cognition; Hippocampus; Alzheimer Disease; Computers; Behavior, Animal","Ho, H; Kejzar, N; Sasaguri, H; Saito, T; Saido, TC; De Strooper, B; Bauza, M; Krupic, J"

Data-driven large-scale genomic analysis reveals an intricate phylogenetic and functional landscape in J-domain proteins.,"The 70-kD heat shock protein (Hsp70) chaperone system is a central hub of the proteostasis network that helps maintain protein homeostasis in all organisms. The recruitment of Hsp70 to perform different and specific cellular functions is regulated by the J-domain protein (JDP) co-chaperone family carrying the small namesake J-domain, required to interact and drive the ATPase cycle of Hsp70s. Besides the J-domain, prokaryotic and eukaryotic JDPs display a staggering diversity in domain architecture, function, and cellular localization. Very little is known about the overall JDP family, despite their essential role in cellular proteostasis, development, and its link to a broad range of human diseases. In this work, we leverage the exponentially increasing number of JDP gene sequences identified across all kingdoms owing to the advancements in sequencing technology and provide a broad overview of the JDP repertoire. Using an automated classification scheme based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), we demonstrate that the sequences of J-domains carry sufficient discriminatory information to reliably recover the phylogeny, localization, and domain composition of the corresponding full-length JDP. By harnessing the interpretability of the ANNs, we find that many of the discriminatory sequence positions match residues that form the interaction interface between the J-domain and Hsp70. This reveals that key residues within the J-domains have coevolved with their obligatory Hsp70 partners to build chaperone circuits for specific functions in cells.",2023,Hsp40 co-chaperones; J-domain proteins; artificial neural networks; large-scale data analysis; protein homeostasis,Humans; Amino Acid Sequence; Genomics; HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Molecular Chaperones; Phylogeny,"Malinverni, D; Zamuner, S; Rebeaud, ME; Barducci, A; Nillegoda, NB; De Los Rios, P"

Genome-Wide Epistasis Study of Cerebrospinal Fluid Hyperphosphorylated Tau in ADNI Cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide, and the genetic mechanism of which is not yet fully understood. Much evidence has accumulated over the past decade to suggest that after the first large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted, the problem of ""missing heritability"" in AD is still a great challenge. Epistasis has been considered as one of the main causes of ""missing heritability"" in AD, which has been largely ignored in human genetics. The focus of current genome-wide epistasis studies is usually on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have significant individual effects, and the amount of heritability explained by which was very low. Moreover, AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal damage, and some studies have suggested that hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) mediates neuronal death by inducing necroptosis and inflammation in AD. Therefore, this study focused on identifying epistasis between two-marker interactions at marginal main effects across the whole genome using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) P-tau as quantitative trait (QT). We sought to detect interactions between SNPs in a multi-GPU based linear regression method by using age, gender, and clinical diagnostic status (cds) as covariates. We then used the STRING online tool to perform the PPI network and identify two-marker epistasis at the level of gene-gene interaction. A total of 758 SNP pairs were found to be statistically significant. Particularly, between the marginal main effect SNP pairs, highly significant SNP-SNP interactions were identified, which explained a relatively high variance at the P-tau level. In addition, 331 AD-related genes were identified, 10 gene-gene interaction pairs were replicated in the PPI network. The identified gene-gene interactions and genes showed associations with AD in terms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, neuronal cells activation and brain development, thereby leading to cognitive decline in AD, which is indirectly associated with the P-tau pathological feature of AD and in turn supports the results of this study. Thus, the results of our study might be beneficial for explaining part of the ""missing heritability"" of AD.",2023,ADNI; Alzheimer’s disease; PPI; epistasis; hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau),"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Genome-Wide Association Study; Epistasis, Genetic","Chen, D; Li, J; Liu, H; Liu, X; Zhang, C; Luo, H; Wei, Y; Xi, Y; Liang, H; Zhang, Q"
Detecting Dementia from Face-Related Features with Automated Computational Methods.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia that is more likely to occur as people age. It currently has no known cure. As the world's population is aging quickly, early screening for AD has become increasingly important. Traditional screening methods such as brain scans or psychiatric tests are stressful and costly. The patients are likely to feel reluctant to such screenings and fail to receive timely intervention. While researchers have been exploring the use of language in dementia detection, less attention has been given to face-related features. The paper focuses on investigating how face-related features can aid in detecting dementia by exploring the PROMPT dataset that contains video data collected from patients with dementia during interviews. In this work, we extracted three types of features from the videos, including face mesh, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, and Action Units (AU). We trained traditional machine learning models and deep learning models on the extracted features and investigated their effectiveness in dementia detection. Our experiments show that the use of HOG features achieved the highest accuracy of 79% in dementia detection, followed by AU features with 71% accuracy, and face mesh features with 66% accuracy. Our results show that face-related features have the potential to be a crucial indicator in automated computational dementia detection.",2023,HOG; action unit; dementia detection; face mesh; machine learning,,"Zheng, C; Bouazizi, M; Ohtsuki, T; Kitazawa, M; Horigome, T; Kishimoto, T"

Speech and language markers of neurodegeneration: a call for global equity.,"In the field of neurodegeneration, speech and language assessments are useful for diagnosing aphasic syndromes and for characterizing other disorders. As a complement to classic tests, scalable and low-cost digital tools can capture relevant anomalies automatically, potentially supporting the quest for globally equitable markers of brain health. However, this promise remains unfulfilled due to limited linguistic diversity in scientific works and clinical instruments. Here we argue for cross-linguistic research as a core strategy to counter this problem. First, we survey the contributions of linguistic assessments in the study of primary progressive aphasia and the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Second, we address two forms of linguistic unfairness in the literature: the neglect of most of the world's 7000 languages and the preponderance of English-speaking cohorts. Third, we review studies showing that linguistic dysfunctions in a given disorder may vary depending on the patient's language and that English speakers offer a suboptimal benchmark for other language groups. Finally, we highlight different approaches, tools and initiatives for cross-linguistic research, identifying core challenges for their deployment. Overall, we seek to inspire timely actions to counter a looming source of inequity in behavioural neurology.",2023,cross-linguistic research; language diversity; linguistic testing; neurodegenerative diseases,Humans; Speech; Language; Aphasia; Linguistics; Alzheimer Disease,"García, AM; de Leon, J; Tee, BL; Blasi, DE; Gorno-Tempini, ML"
"Basal Forebrain Atrophy, Cortical Thinning, and Amyloid-β Status in Parkinson's disease-Related Cognitive Decline.",Degeneration of the cortically-projecting cholinergic basal forebrain (cBF) is a well-established pathologic correlate of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Automated detection of cerebral microbleeds on MR images using knowledge distillation framework.,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with white matter damage, and various neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. CMBs occur as small, circular hypointense lesions on T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) images, and hyperintense on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images due to their paramagnetic nature. Accurate automated detection of CMBs would help to determine quantitative imaging biomarkers (e.g., CMB count) on large datasets. In this work, we propose a fully automated, deep learning-based, 3-step algorithm, using structural and anatomical properties of CMBs from any single input image modality (e.g., GRE/SWI/QSM) for their accurate detections.",2023,cerebral microbleed (CMB); deep learning; detection; knowledge distillation; magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM); susceptibility-weighted image (SWI),,"Sundaresan, V; Arthofer, C; Zamboni, G; Murchison, AG; Dineen, RA; Rothwell, PM; Auer, DP; Wang, C; Miller, KL; Tendler, BC; Alfaro-Almagro, F; Sotiropoulos, SN; Sprigg, N; Griffanti, L; Jenkinson, M"
Video-Based Activity Recognition for Automated Motor Assessment of Parkinson's Disease.,"Over the last decade, video-enabled mobile devices have become ubiquitous, while advances in markerless pose estimation allow an individual's body position to be tracked accurately and efficiently across the frames of a video. Previous work by this and other groups has shown that pose-extracted kinematic features can be used to reliably measure motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). This presents the prospect of developing an asynchronous and scalable, video-based assessment of motor dysfunction. Crucial to this endeavour is the ability to automatically recognise the class of an action being performed, without which manual labelling is required. Representing the evolution of body joint locations as a spatio-temporal graph, we implement a deep-learning model for video and frame-level classification of activities performed according to part 3 of the Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). We train and validate this system using a dataset of n = 7310 video clips, recorded at 5 independent sites. This approach reaches human-level performance in detecting and classifying periods of activity within monocular video clips. Our framework could support clinical workflows and patient care at scale through applications such as quality monitoring of clinical data collection, automated labelling of video streams, or a module within a remote self-assessment system.",2023,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Severity of Illness Index; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Biomechanical Phenomena,"Sarapata, G; Dushin, Y; Morinan, G; Ong, J; Budhdeo, S; Kainz, B; O'Keeffe, J"

Preoperative thalamus volume is not associated with preoperative cognitive impairment (preCI) or postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).,"A growing body of literature suggests the important role of the thalamus in cognition and neurodegenerative diseases. This study aims to elucidate whether the preoperative thalamic volume is associated with preoperative cognitive impairment (preCI) and whether it is predictive for postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 3 months (POCD). We enrolled 301 patients aged 65 or older and without signs of dementia who were undergoing elective surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted prior to surgery. Freesurfer (version 5.3.) was used to automatically segment the thalamus volume. A neuropsychological test battery was administered before surgery and at a 3 month follow-up. It included the computerized tests Paired Associate Learning (PAL), Verbal Recognition Memory (VRM), Spatial Span Length (SSP), Simple Reaction Time (SRT), the pen-and-paper Trail-Making-Test (TMT) and the manual Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). Using a reliable change index, preCI and POCD were defined as total Z-score > 1.96 (sum score over all tests) and/or Z-scores > 1.96 in ≥ 2 individual cognitive test parameters. For statistical analyses, multivariable logistic regression models were applied. Age, sex and intracranial volume were covariates in the models. Of 301 patients who received a presurgical neuropsychological testing and MRI, 34 (11.3%) had preCI. 89 patients (29.5%) were lost to follow-up.

Automated Cognitive Health Assessment Based on Daily Life Functional Activities.,"Dementia is increasing day-by-day in older adults. Many of them are spending their life joyfully due to smart home technologies. Smart homes contain several smart devices which can support living at home. Automated assessment of smart home residents is a significant aspect of smart home technology. Detecting dementia in older adults in the early stage is the basic need of this time. Existing technologies can detect dementia timely but lacks performance. In this paper, we proposed an automated cognitive health assessment approach using machines and deep learning based on daily life activities. To validate our approach, we use CASAS publicly available daily life activities dataset for experiments where residents perform their routine activities in a smart home. We use four machine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Furthermore, we use deep neural network (DNN) for healthy and dementia classification. Experiments reveal the 96% accuracy using the MLP classifier. This study suggests using machine learning classifiers for better dementia detection, specifically for the dataset which contains real-world data.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Algorithms; Machine Learning; Dementia; Cognition,"Alsubai, S; Alqahtani, A; Sha, M; Abbas, S; Gregus, M; Furda, R"

Structurally and Morphologically Distinct Pathological Tau Assemblies Differentially Affect GVB Accumulation.,"Tau aggregation is central to the pathogenesis of a large group of neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies, but it is still unclear in which way neurons respond to tau pathology and how tau accumulation leads to neurodegeneration. A striking neuron-specific response to tau pathology is presented by granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs), lysosomal structures that accumulate specific cargo in a dense core. Here we employed different tau aggregation models in primary neurons to investigate which properties of pathological tau assemblies affect GVB accumulation using a combination of confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and quantitative automated high-content microscopy. Employing GFP-tagged and untagged tau variants that spontaneously form intraneuronal aggregates, we induced pathological tau assemblies with a distinct subcellular localization, morphology, and ultrastructure depending on the presence or absence of the GFP tag. The quantification of the GVB load in the different models showed that an increased GVB accumulation is associated with the untagged tau aggregation model, characterized by shorter and more randomly distributed tau filaments in the neuronal soma. Our data indicate that tau aggregate structure and/or subcellular localization may be key determinants of GVB accumulation.",2023,Tau; aggregation; granulovacuolar degeneration bodies; neurodegenerative disease,Humans; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Neurons; Nerve Degeneration; Alzheimer Disease; Brain,"Jorge-Oliva, M; van Weering, JRT; Scheper, W"
inMTSCCA: An Integrated Multi-task Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multi-omic Brain Imaging Genetics.,"Identifying genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. To date, different endophenotypes, such as imaging-derived endophenotypes and proteomic expression-derived endophenotypes, have shown the great value in uncovering risk genes compared to case-control studies. Biologically, a co-varying pattern of different omics-derived endophenotypes could result from the shared genetic basis. However, existing methods mainly focus on the effect of endophenotypes alone; the effect of cross-endophenotype (CEP) associations remains largely unexploited. In this study, we used both endophenotypes and their CEP associations of multi-omic data to identify genetic risk factors, and proposed two integrated multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis (inMTSCCA) methods, i.e., pairwise endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (pcMTSCCA) and high-order endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (hocMTSCCA). pcMTSCCA employed pairwise correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived, plasma-derived, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived endophenotypes as an additional penalty. hocMTSCCA used high-order correlations among these multi-omic data for regularization. To figure out genetic risk factors at individual and group levels, as well as altered endophenotypic markers, we introduced sparsity-inducing penalties for both models. We compared pcMTSCCA and hocMTSCCA with three related methods on both simulation and real (consisting of neuroimaging data, proteomic analytes, and genetic data) datasets. The results showed that our methods obtained better or comparable canonical correlation coefficients (CCCs) and better feature subsets than benchmarks. Most importantly, the identified genetic loci and heterogeneous endophenotypic markers showed high relevance. Therefore, jointly using multi-omic endophenotypes and their CEP associations is promising to reveal genetic risk factors.

AI-assisted ethics? considerations of AI simulation for the ethical assessment and design of assistive technologies.,"Current ethical debates on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare treat AI as a product of technology in three ways. First, by assessing risks and potential benefits of currently developed AI-enabled products with ethical checklists; second, by proposing ex ante lists of ethical values seen as relevant for the design and development of assistive technology, and third, by promoting AI technology to use moral reasoning as part of the automation process. The dominance of these three perspectives in the discourse is demonstrated by a brief summary of the literature. Subsequently, we propose a fourth approach to AI, namely, as a methodological tool to assist ethical reflection. We provide a concept of an AI-simulation informed by three separate elements: 1) stochastic human behavior models based on behavioral data for simulating realistic settings, 2) qualitative empirical data on value statements regarding internal policy, and 3) visualization components that aid in understanding the impact of changes in these variables. The potential of this approach is to inform an interdisciplinary field about anticipated ethical challenges or ethical trade-offs in concrete settings and, hence, to spark a re-evaluation of design and implementation plans. This may be particularly useful for applications that deal with extremely complex values and behavior or with limitations on the communication resources of affected persons (e.g., persons with dementia care or for care of persons with cognitive impairment). Simulation does not replace ethical reflection but does allow for detailed, context-sensitive analysis during the design process and prior to implementation. Finally, we discuss the inherently quantitative methods of analysis afforded by stochastic simulations as well as the potential for ethical discussions and how simulations with AI can improve traditional forms of thought experiments and future-oriented technology assessment.",2023,conceptual approach; ethical reflection; intelligent assistive technology; person with dementia; simulation,,"Schicktanz, S; Welsch, J; Schweda, M; Hein, A; Rieger, JW; Kirste, T"
Explainable Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Linguistic Features from Automatic Speech Recognition.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia and can cause abnormal cognitive function and progressive loss of essential life skills. Early screening is thus necessary for the prevention and intervention of AD. Speech dysfunction is an early onset symptom of AD patients. Recent studies have demonstrated the promise of automated acoustic assessment using acoustic or linguistic features extracted from speech. However, most previous studies have relied on manual transcription of text to extract linguistic features, which weakens the efficiency of automated assessment. The present study thus investigates the effectiveness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in building an end-to-end automated speech analysis model for AD detection.",2023,ADReSS; Alzheimer’s disease; Automatic speech recognition; Ensemble learning; Linguistic features,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech Perception; Linguistics; Speech; Cognition,"Tang, L; Zhang, Z; Feng, F; Yang, LZ; Li, H"

ACT is developed for high-throughput batch processing of images collected from multiple samples and is available as an open-source code.

Structural and molecular cholinergic imaging markers of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.,"Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease is related to cholinergic system degeneration, which can be assessed in vivo using structural MRI markers of basal forebrain volume and PET measures of cortical cholinergic activity. In the present study we aimed to examine the interrelation between basal forebrain degeneration and PET-measured depletion of cortical acetylcholinesterase activity as well as their relative contribution to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. This cross-sectional study included 143 Parkinson's disease participants without dementia and 52 healthy control participants who underwent structural MRI, PET scanning with 11C-methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate (PMP) as a measure of cortical acetylcholinesterase activity, and a detailed cognitive assessment. Based on the fifth percentile of the overall cortical PMP PET signal from the control group, people with Parkinson's disease were subdivided into a normo-cholinergic (n = 94) and a hypo-cholinergic group (n = 49). Volumes of functionally defined posterior and anterior basal forebrain subregions were extracted using an established automated MRI volumetry approach based on a stereotactic atlas of cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei. We used Bayesian t-tests to compare basal forebrain volumes between controls, and normo- and hypo-cholinergic Parkinson's participants after covarying out age, sex and years of education. Associations between the two cholinergic imaging measures were assessed across all people with Parkinson's disease using Bayesian correlations and their respective relations with performance in different cognitive domains were assessed with Bayesian ANCOVAs. As a specificity analysis, hippocampal volume was added to the analysis. We found evidence for a reduction of posterior basal forebrain volume in the hypo-cholinergic compared to both normo-cholinergic Parkinson's disease [Bayes factor against the null model (BF10) = 8.2] and control participants (BF10 = 6.0), while for the anterior basal forebrain the evidence was inconclusive (BF10 < 3). In continuous association analyses, posterior basal forebrain volume was significantly associated with cortical PMP PET signal in a temporo-posterior distribution. The combined models for the prediction of cognitive scores showed that both cholinergic markers (posterior basal forebrain volume and cortical PMP PET signal) were independently related to multi-domain cognitive deficits, and were more important predictors for all cognitive scores, including memory scores, than hippocampal volume. We conclude that degeneration of the posterior basal forebrain in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by functional cortical changes in acetylcholinesterase activity and that both PET and MRI cholinergic imaging markers are independently associated with multi-domain cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease without dementia. Comparatively, hippocampal atrophy only seems to have minimal involvement in the development of early cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.",2023,MRI; Parkinson’s disease; acetylcholinesterase; basal forebrain; cholinergic deficit; positron emission tomography,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Acetylcholinesterase; Bayes Theorem; Cross-Sectional Studies; Positron-Emission Tomography; Cholinergic Agents; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Dementia; Basal Forebrain,"Schumacher, J; Kanel, P; Dyrba, M; Storch, A; Bohnen, NI; Teipel, S; Grothe, MJ"
Hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase activity regulates cerebral Aβ metabolism and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease in mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. However, how the role of peripheral organ changes in response to environmental stimuli during aging in AD pathogenesis remains unknown. Hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) activity increases with age. Hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally attenuates brain amyloid-β (Aβ) burden, tauopathy, and cognitive deficits in AD mouse models. Moreover, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma level of 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (-EET), which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and modulates brain Aβ metabolism through multiple pathways. A balance between the brain levels of 14,15-EET and Aβ is essential for preventing Aβ deposition. In AD models, 14,15-EET infusion mimicked the neuroprotective effects of hepatic sEH ablation at biological and behavioral levels. These results highlight the liver's key role in AD pathology, and targeting the liver-brain axis in response to environmental stimuli may constitute a promising therapeutic approach for AD prevention.",2023,"14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid; Alzheimer’s disease; apolipoprotein E; liver; soluble epoxide hydrolase","Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Epoxide Hydrolases; Liver","Wu, Y; Dong, JH; Dai, YF; Zhu, MZ; Wang, MY; Zhang, Y; Pan, YD; Yuan, XR; Guo, ZX; Wang, CX; Li, YQ; Zhu, XH"

Neuroimaging feature extraction using a neural network classifier for imaging genetics.,"Dealing with the high dimension of both neuroimaging data and genetic data is a difficult problem in the association of genetic data to neuroimaging.

Supported by a vast literature on the predictive power of neural networks, our proposed solution uses neural networks to extract from neuroimaging data features that are relevant for predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for subsequent relation to genetics. The neuroimaging-genetic pipeline we propose is comprised of image processing, neuroimaging feature extraction and genetic association steps. We present a neural network classifier for extracting neuroimaging features that are related with the disease.

Evaluation of volumetric asymmetry of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe in Alzheimer's disease using the atlas-based method.,"Brain areas affected during neurodegenerative disease progression are considered anatomically connected to the first affected areas. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has connections with the medial temporal lobe (MTL), which includes regions that become atrophic in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the degree of volumetric asymmetry of DLPFC and MTL structures. This is a cross-sectional volumetric study involving 25 Alzheimer's disease patients and 25 healthy adults who underwent MRI with a 3D turbo spin echo sequence at 1.5 Tesla. The atlas-based method incorporated MRIStudio software to automatically measure the volume of brain structures. We compared the asymmetry index and volumetric changes across study groups and correlated them with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. We observed significant volumetric rightward lateralization in the DLPFC and superior frontal gyrus in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to the healthy controls. There was a significant volume loss in the MTL structures of Alzheimer's disease patients. Atrophy of MTL structures was positively correlated with right DLPFC volume changes in Alzheimer's disease patients. Volumetric asymmetry of the DLPFC may be a characteristic for determining disease progression in Alzheimer's disease patients. Future studies are recommended to evaluate whether these volumetric asymmetrical changes are specific to Alzheimer's disease and whether asymmetry measurements can serve as diagnostic markers.",2023,,Adult; Humans; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Atrophy; Temporal Lobe,"Karaca, O; Tepe, N; Ozcan, E"
NORHA: A NORmal Hippocampal Asymmetry Deviation Index Based on One-Class Novelty Detection and 3D Shape Features.,"Radiologists routinely analyze hippocampal asymmetries in magnetic resonance (MR) images as a biomarker for neurodegenerative conditions like epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease. However, current clinical tools rely on either subjective evaluations, basic volume measurements, or disease-specific models that fail to capture more complex differences in normal shape. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by introducing NORHA, a novel NORmal Hippocampal Asymmetry deviation index that uses machine learning novelty detection to objectively quantify it from MR scans. NORHA is based on a One-Class Support Vector Machine model learned from a set of morphological features extracted from automatically segmented hippocampi of healthy subjects. Hence, in test time, the model automatically measures how far a new unseen sample falls with respect to the feature space of normal individuals. This avoids biases produced by standard classification models, which require being trained using diseased cases and therefore learning to characterize changes produced only by the ones. We evaluated our new index in multiple clinical use cases using public and private MRI datasets comprising control individuals and subjects with different levels of dementia or epilepsy. The index reported high values for subjects with unilateral atrophies and remained low for controls or individuals with mild or severe symmetric bilateral changes. It also showed high AUC values for discriminating individuals with hippocampal sclerosis, further emphasizing its ability to characterize unilateral abnormalities. Finally, a positive correlation between NORHA and the functional cognitive test CDR-SB was observed, highlighting its promising application as a biomarker for dementia.",2023,Hippocampus; Machine learning; Normal asymmetries; Novelty detection,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Hippocampus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers,"Deangeli, D; Iarussi, F; Külsgaard, H; Braggio, D; Princich, JP; Bendersky, M; Iarussi, E; Larrabide, I; Orlando, JI"
fMRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using the SAS Method with Multi-Layer Perceptron Network.,"In the present scenario, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the incurable neuro-degenerative disorders, which accounts for nearly 60% to 70% of dementia cases. Currently, several machine-learning approaches and neuroimaging modalities are utilized for diagnosing AD. Among the available neuroimaging modalities, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is extensively utilized for studying brain activities related to AD. However, analyzing complex brain structures in fMRI is a time-consuming and complex task; so, a novel automated model was proposed in this manuscript for early diagnosis of AD using fMRI images. Initially, the fMRI images are acquired from an online dataset: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Further, the quality of the acquired fMRI images was improved by implementing a normalization technique. Then, the Segmentation by Aggregating Superpixels (SAS) method was implemented for segmenting the brain regions (AD, Normal Controls (NC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Significant Memory Concern (SMC)) from the denoised fMRI images. From the segmented brain regions, feature vectors were extracted by employing Gabor and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) techniques. The obtained feature vectors were dimensionally reduced by implementing Honey Badger Optimization Algorithm (HBOA) and fed to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for classifying the fMRI images as AD, NC, MCI, EMCI, LMCI, and SMC. The extensive investigation indicated that the presented model attained 99.44% of classification accuracy, 88.90% of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 90.82% of Jaccard Coefficient (JC), and 88.43% of Hausdorff Distance (HD). The attained results are better compared with the conventional segmentation and classification models.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Honey Badger Optimization Algorithm; Multi-Layer Perceptron; Superpixels; functional magnetic resonance imaging; normalization technique,,"Chelladurai, A; Narayan, DL; Divakarachari, PB; Loganathan, U"
Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Speech and language changes occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few studies have characterized their longitudinal course. We analyzed open-ended speech samples from a prodromal-to-mild AD cohort to develop a novel composite score to characterize progressive speech changes. Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD. Speech-based composite scores could be used to monitor change and detect response to treatment in future research.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; digital biomarkers; language; mild cognitive impairment; natural language processing; speech,,"Robin, J; Xu, M; Balagopalan, A; Novikova, J; Kahn, L; Oday, A; Hejrati, M; Hashemifar, S; Negahdar, M; Simpson, W; Teng, E"
Association between Neuropsychological Performance and CSF Profile in Subjective Cognitive Decline: Towards the Diagnosis of Preclinical AD.,"In the perspective of novel treatments with disease-modifying drugs, a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's' disease (AD) at preclinical phase represents a major issue. To this purpose, in clinical setting, there is the need to detect the earliest cognitive symptoms not yet fulfilling Mild Cognitive Impairment criteria, in order to proceed to biomarker assessment for diagnostic definition. In terms of cognitive performance, Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) is still a controversial entity, due to the difficulty of reliably measuring subtle deficits.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; CANTAB; cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; neuropsychological assessment; subjective cognitive decline,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Retrospective Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Short-Term; Biomarkers","Chipi, E; Bellomo, G; Salvadori, N; Montanucci, C; Gaetani, L; Paolini Paoletti, F; Parnetti, L"
Diagnostic Biomarkers of Amyloid and Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease: An Overview of Tests for Clinical Practice in the United States and Europe.,"Amyloid and tau biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease are widely recognized diagnostic tools for the identification of Alzheimer's disease pathology antemortem and are recommended by the most recent clinical and research guidelines. Approved biomarkers include positron emission tomography (PET)- and fluid-based markers derived from cerebrospinal fluid and, more recently, plasma. These biomarkers are still infrequently used in clinical practice, potentially due to challenges in access to and understanding of individual assay information and methodology. We provide an overview of the diagnostic biomarkers for amyloid and tau pathology that are currently available in the US and/or EU for clinical use. Available performance data from both labels/instructions for use and the scientific literature (with focus on autopsy or PET as standard of truth) are summarized to help healthcare providers navigate the biomarker landscape. All available PET amyloid and tau biomarkers demonstrate high accuracy in identifying amyloid and tau Alzheimer's disease pathology, respectively, at autopsy. Among cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, all showed accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease pathology, either based on autopsy or PET findings; greater accuracy was evident for concentration ratios (Aβ42/40 or P-tau181/Aβ42) versus individual biomarker concentrations. Among plasma biomarkers, Aβ42/40 and P-tau181 demonstrated high agreement with PET findings. Overall, we conclude that commercially available PET, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma assays accurately identify Alzheimer's disease amyloid and tau pathology. The recent development of fully automated tests for fluid-based biomarkers improves test reliability. The continued development of plasma biomarkers holds promise for the future management of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; diagnostic biomarker; tau,Humans; United States; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Reproducibility of Results; Amyloid; Biomarkers,"Iaccarino, L; Burnham, SC; Dell'Agnello, G; Dowsett, SA; Epelbaum, S"

Higher serum uric acid is associated with poorer cognitive performance in healthy middle-aged people: a cross-sectional study.,"Age-related cognitive impairment can occur many years before the onset of the clinical symptoms of dementia. Uric acid (UA), a metabolite of purine-rich foods, has been shown to be positively associated with improved cognitive function, but such association remains controversial. Moreover, most of the previous studies investigating the association included elderly participants with memory-related diseases. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating whether serum UA (sUA) is associated with cognitive performance in healthy middle-aged individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional study on a cohort of middle-aged individuals (40-60 years old) who participated in the Qatar Biobank. The participants had no memory-related diseases, schizophrenia, stroke, or brain damage. They were divided according to sUA level into a normal group (< 360 μmol/L) and a high group (≥ 360 μmol/L), and underwent an assessment of cognitive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Two cognitive function domains were assessed: (a) speed of reaction/reaction time and (b) short-term visual memory. The median age of the 931 participants included in the study was 48.0 years (IQR: 44.0, 53.0), of which 47.6% were male. Adjusted multivariable linear regression analyses showed that higher sUA is associated with poorer performance on the visual memory domain of cognitive function (β = - 6.87, 95% CI - 11.65 to - 2.10, P = 0.005), but not on the speed of reaction domain (β = - 55.16, 95% CI - 190.63 to 80.30, P = 0.424). Our findings support previous studies suggesting an inverse association between high sUA levels and cognitive function in elderly and extend the evidence for such a role to middle-aged participants. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the relationship between UA and cognition.",2023,Cognitive function; Qatar Biobank (QBB); Uric acid,Aged; Middle Aged; Humans; Male; Adult; Female; Uric Acid; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Stroke; Risk Factors,"Khaled, Y; Abdelhamid, AA; Al-Mazroey, H; Almannai, AK; Fetais, S; Al-Srami, AS; Ahmed, S; Al-Hajri, N; Mustafa, A; Chivese, T; Djouhri, L"
End-to-end automatic pathology localization for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using structural MRI.,"Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an essential part of the clinical assessment of patients at risk of Alzheimer dementia. One key challenge in sMRI-based computer-aided dementia diagnosis is to localize local pathological regions for discriminative feature learning. Existing solutions predominantly depend on generating saliency maps for pathology localization and handle the localization task independently of the dementia diagnosis task, leading to a complex multi-stage training pipeline that is hard to optimize with weakly-supervised sMRI-level annotations. In this work, we aim to simplify the pathology localization task and construct an end-to-end automatic localization framework (AutoLoc) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To this end, we first present an efficient pathology localization paradigm that directly predicts the coordinate of the most disease-related region in each sMRI slice. Then, we approximate the non-differentiable patch-cropping operation with the bilinear interpolation technique, which eliminates the barrier to gradient backpropagation and thus enables the joint optimization of localization and diagnosis tasks. Extensive experiments on commonly used ADNI and AIBL datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially, we achieve 93.38% and 81.12% accuracy on Alzheimer's disease classification and mild cognitive impairment conversion prediction tasks, respectively. Several important brain regions, such as rostral hippocampus and globus pallidus, are identified to be highly associated with Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis; Differentiable patch-cropping; End-to-end joint learning; Location coordinate prediction; Pathology localization,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Brain; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Cognitive Dysfunction","Cao, G; Zhang, M; Wang, Y; Zhang, J; Han, Y; Xu, X; Huang, J; Kang, G"
A new weakly supervised deep neural network for recognizing Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects older adults, causing memory loss and decline in thinking skills. In recent years, many traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have been used to assist in the diagnosis of AD, and most existing methods focus on early prediction of disease on a supervised basis. In reality, there is a massive amount of medical data available. However, some of those data have problems with the low-quality or lack of labels, and the cost of labeling them will be too high. To solve above problem, a new Weakly Supervised Deep Learning model (WSDL) is proposed, which adds attention mechanisms and consistency regularization to the EfficientNet framework and uses data augmentation techniques on the original data that can take full advantage of this unlabeled data. Validation of the proposed WSDL method on the brain MRI datasets of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Program by setting five different unlabeled ratios to complete weakly supervised training showed better performance according to the compared experimental results with others baselines.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Deep learning (DL); Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Unlabeled data; Weakly supervised learning,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Machine Learning","Zhang, X; Li, Z; Zhang, Q; Yin, Z; Lu, Z; Li, Y"

Interprofessional Needs Analysis and User-Centred Prototype Evaluation as a Foundation for Building Individualized Digital Education in Dementia Healthcare Supported by Artificial Intelligence: A Study Protocol.,"Continuous profession-specific training is necessary to provide high-quality care for people with dementia. Research shows the need for more educational programmes that are personalized and responsive to the learning needs and preferences of staff. Digital solutions supported by artificial intelligence (AI) may be a means of making these improvements. There is a lack of formats that support learners in selecting the right content according to their learning needs and preferences. The project ""My INdividual Digital EDucation.RUHR"" (MINDED.RUHR) addresses this problem and seeks to develop an automatized delivery system for individual learning content using AI.

"An automated, geometry-based method for hippocampal shape and thickness analysis.","The hippocampus is one of the most studied neuroanatomical structures due to its involvement in attention, learning, and memory as well as its atrophy in ageing, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. Hippocampal shape changes, however, are complex and cannot be fully characterized by a single summary metric such as hippocampal volume as determined from MR images. In this work, we propose an automated, geometry-based approach for the unfolding, point-wise correspondence, and local analysis of hippocampal shape features such as thickness and curvature. Starting from an automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields, we create a 3D tetrahedral mesh model as well as a 3D intrinsic coordinate system of the hippocampal body. From this coordinate system, we derive local curvature and thickness estimates as well as a 2D sheet for hippocampal unfolding. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm with a series of experiments to quantify neurodegenerative changes in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia. We find that hippocampal thickness estimates detect known differences between clinical groups and can determine the location of these effects on the hippocampal sheet. Further, thickness estimates improve classification of clinical groups and cognitively unimpaired controls when added as an additional predictor. Comparable results are obtained with different datasets and segmentation algorithms. Taken together, we replicate canonical findings on hippocampal volume/shape changes in dementia, extend them by gaining insight into their spatial localization on the hippocampal sheet, and provide additional, complementary information beyond traditional measures. We provide a new set of sensitive processing and analysis tools for the analysis of hippocampal geometry that allows comparisons across studies without relying on image registration or requiring manual intervention.",2023,Flattening; Hippocampus; Neuroimaging; Shape analysis; Thickness,"Hippocampus; Organ Size; Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Datasets as Topic; Algorithms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging","Diers, K; Baumeister, H; Jessen, F; Düzel, E; Berron, D; Reuter, M"
Diagnosis of cerebral microbleed via VGG and extreme learning machine trained by Gaussian map bat algorithm.,"Cerebral microbleed (CMB) is a serious public health concern. It is associated with dementia, which can be detected with brain magnetic resonance image (MRI). CMBs often appear as tiny round dots on MRIs, and they can be spotted anywhere over brain. Therefore, manual inspection is tedious and lengthy, and the results are often short in reproducible. In this paper, a novel automatic CMB diagnosis method was proposed based on deep learning and optimization algorithms, which used the brain MRI as the input and output the diagnosis results as CMB and non-CMB. Firstly, sliding window processing was employed to generate the dataset from brain MRIs. Then, a pre-trained VGG was employed to obtain the image features from the dataset. Finally, an ELM was trained by Gaussian-map bat algorithm (GBA) for identification. Results showed that the proposed method VGG-ELM-GBA provided better generalization performance than several state-of-the-art approaches.",2023,Cerebral microbleed; Deep learning; Extreme learning machine; Gaussian map; Magnetic resonance image,,"Lu, S; Xia, K; Wang, SH"
Repeated Measurement of Microglia-Dendritic Spine Interactions Using Multi-Photon Imaging.,"In recent decades, mounting evidence has shown that microglia play a vital role in maintaining synapses throughout life. This maintenance is done via numerous microglial processes, which are long, thin, and highly motile protrusions from the cell body that monitor their environment. However, due to the brevity of the contacts and the potentially transient nature of synaptic structures, establishing the underlying dynamics of this relationship has proven difficult. This article describes a method of using rapidly acquired multiphoton microscopy images to track microglial dynamics and microglia:synapse interactions and the fate of the synaptic structures following those interactions. First, we detail a method for capturing multiphoton images at 1-min intervals for approximately 1 hr and how that process can be done at multiple time points. We then discuss how best to prevent and account for any drifting of the region of interest that can occur during the imaging session and how to remove excessive background noise from those images. Finally, we detail the annotation process for dendritic spines and microglial processes using plugins in MATLAB and Fiji, respectively. These semi-automated plugins allow tracking of individual cell structures, even if both microglia and neurons are imaged in the same fluorescent channel. This protocol presents a method of tracking both microglial dynamics and synaptic structures, in the same animal, at multiple time points, giving the user information on process speed, branching, tip size, location, and dwell time, as well as any dendritic spine gains, losses, and size changes. © 2023 The Authors.

The radiomics features of the temporal lobe region related to menopause based on MR-T2WI can be used as potential biomarkers for AD.,"Menopause may be an important pathogenic factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammatory responses occur in the early pathogenetic stages of AD. Currently, no effective monitoring markers are available for AD's early pathological manifestations. Radiomics is an automated feature generation method for the extraction of hundreds of quantitative phenotypes (radiomics features) from radiology images. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the magnetic resonance T2-weighted imaging (MR-T2WI) on the temporal lobe region and clinical data of both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. There were three significant differences were identified for select radiomic features in the temporal lobe between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, i.e. the texture feature Original-glcm-Idn (OI) based on the Original image, the filter-based first-order feature Log-firstorder-Mean (LM), and the texture feature Wavelet-LHH-glrlm-Run Length Nonuniformity (WLR). In humans, these three features were significantly correlated with the timing of menopause. In mice, these features were also different between the sham and ovariectomy (OVX) groups and were significantly associated with neuronal damage, microglial M1 polarization, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline in the OVX groups. In AD patients, OI was significantly associated with cognitive decline, while LM was associated with anxiety and depression. OI and WLR could distinguish AD from healthy controls. In conclusion, radiomics features based on brain MR-T2WI scans have the potential to serve as biomarkers for AD and noninvasive monitoring of pathological progression in the temporal lobe of the brain in women undergoing menopause.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; MR-T2WI; menopausal women; microglia; radiomic features,Humans; Female; Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Retrospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biomarkers; Temporal Lobe; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Menopause,"Li, M; Zhang, J; Shi, Y; Liu, S; Liu, X; Ning, Y; Cao, Y; Deng, Y; Zhao, Y"
Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease: Potential and Perspectives.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a global health challenge in the 21st century due to its increasing prevalence as the major cause of dementia. State-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI)-based tests could potentially improve population-based strategies to detect and manage AD. Current retinal imaging demonstrates immense potential as a non-invasive screening measure for AD, by studying qualitative and quantitative changes in the neuronal and vascular structures of the retina that are often associated with degenerative changes in the brain. On the other hand, the tremendous success of AI, especially deep learning, in recent years has encouraged its incorporation with retinal imaging for predicting systemic diseases. Further development in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), defined as a subfield of machine learning that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning, also prompts the question of how it can work hand in hand with retinal imaging as a viable tool for automated prediction of AD. This review aims to discuss potential applications of DRL in using retinal imaging to study AD, and their synergistic application to unlock other possibilities, such as AD detection and prediction of AD progression. Challenges and future directions, such as the use of inverse DRL in defining reward function, lack of standardization in retinal imaging, and data availability, will also be addressed to bridge gaps for its transition into clinical use.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; deep reinforcement learning; reinforcement learning; retinal imaging,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Retina; Machine Learning,"Hui, HYH; Ran, AR; Dai, JJ; Cheung, CY"

Comparing the effects of four common drug classes on the progression of mild cognitive impairment to dementia using electronic health records.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the potential association between the use of four frequently prescribed drug classes, namely antihypertensive drugs, statins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and proton-pump inhibitors, and the likelihood of disease progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia using electronic health records (EHRs). We conducted a retrospective cohort study using observational EHRs from a cohort of approximately 2 million patients seen at a large, multi-specialty urban academic medical center in New York City, USA between 2008 and 2020 to automatically emulate the randomized controlled trials. For each drug class, two exposure groups were identified based on the prescription orders documented in the EHRs following their MCI diagnosis. During follow-up, we measured drug efficacy based on the incidence of dementia and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of various drugs. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we confirmed the ATE estimates via bootstrapping and presented associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our analysis identified 14,269 MCI patients, among whom 2501 (17.5%) progressed to dementia. Using average treatment estimation and bootstrapping confirmation, we observed that drugs including rosuvastatin (ATE = - 0.0140 [- 0.0191, - 0.0088], p value < 0.001), citalopram (ATE = - 0.1128 [- 0.125, - 0.1005], p value < 0.001), escitalopram (ATE = - 0.0560 [- 0.0615, - 0.0506], p value < 0.001), and omeprazole (ATE = - 0.0201 [- 0.0299, - 0.0103], p value < 0.001) have a statistically significant association in slowing the progression from MCI to dementia.

An 8-cage imaging system for automated analyses of mouse behavior.,"The analysis of mouse behavior is used in biomedical research to study brain function in health and disease. Well-established rapid assays allow for high-throughput analyses of behavior but have several drawbacks, including measurements of daytime behaviors in nocturnal animals, effects of animal handling, and the lack of an acclimation period in the testing apparatus. We developed a novel 8-cage imaging system, with animated visual stimuli, for automated analyses of mouse behavior in 22-h overnight recordings. Software for image analysis was developed in two open-source programs, ImageJ and DeepLabCut. The imaging system was tested using 4-5 month-old female wild-type mice and 3xTg-AD mice, a widely-used model to study Alzheimer's disease (AD). The overnight recordings provided measurements of multiple behaviors including acclimation to the novel cage environment, day and nighttime activity, stretch-attend postures, location in various cage areas, and habituation to animated visual stimuli. The behavioral profiles were different in wild-type and 3xTg-AD mice. AD-model mice displayed reduced acclimation to the novel cage environment, were hyperactive during the first hour of darkness, and spent less time at home in comparison to wild-type mice. We propose that the imaging system may be used to study various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Female; Alzheimer Disease; Mice, Transgenic; Motor Activity; Behavior, Animal; Software; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Inbred C57BL","Del Rosario Hernández, T; Joshi, NR; Gore, SV; Kreiling, JA; Creton, R"

Do Epilepsy Patients with Cognitive Impairment Have Alzheimer's Disease-like Brain Metabolism?,"Although not classically considered together, there is emerging evidence that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy share a number of features and that each disease predisposes patients to developing the other. Using machine learning, we have previously developed an automated fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) reading program (i.e., MAD), and demonstrated good sensitivity (84%) and specificity (95%) for differentiating AD patients versus healthy controls. In this retrospective chart review study, we investigated if epilepsy patients with/without mild cognitive symptoms also show AD-like metabolic patterns determined by the MAD algorithm. Scans from a total of 20 patients with epilepsy were included in this study. Because AD diagnoses are made late in life, only patients aged ≥40 years were considered. For the cognitively impaired patients, four of six were identified as MAD+ (i.e., the FDG-PET image is classified as AD-like by the MAD algorithm), while none of the five cognitively normal patients was identified as MAD+ (χ",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; FDG-PET; biomarker; epilepsy; machine learning; metabolic classification; neurodegenerative disease; support vector machine,,"He, M; Kolesar, TA; Goertzen, AL; Ng, MC; Ko, JH"

Metapaths: similarity search in heterogeneous knowledge graphs via meta-paths.,"Heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs) have enabled the modeling of complex systems, from genetic interaction graphs and protein-protein interaction networks to networks representing drugs, diseases, proteins, and side effects. Analytical methods for KGs rely on quantifying similarities between entities, such as nodes, in the graph. However, such methods must consider the diversity of node and edge types contained within the KG via, for example, defined sequences of entity types known as meta-paths. We present metapaths, the first R software package to implement meta-paths and perform meta-path-based similarity search in heterogeneous KGs. The metapaths package offers various built-in similarity metrics for node pair comparison by querying KGs represented as either edge or adjacency lists, as well as auxiliary aggregation methods to measure set-level relationships. Indeed, evaluation of these methods on an open-source biomedical KG recovered meaningful drug and disease-associated relationships, including those in Alzheimer's disease. The metapaths framework facilitates the scalable and flexible modeling of network similarities in KGs with applications across KG learning.",2023,,"Humans; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Software; Alzheimer Disease; Protein Interaction Maps","Noori, A; Li, MM; Tan, ALM; Zitnik, M"
Speech changes in old age: Methodological considerations for speech-based discrimination of healthy ageing and Alzheimer's disease.,"Recent evidence suggests that speech substantially changes in ageing. As a complex neurophysiological process, it can accurately reflect changes in the motor and cognitive systems underpinning human speech. Since healthy ageing is not always easily discriminable from early stages of dementia based on cognitive and behavioural hallmarks, speech is explored as a preclinical biomarker of pathological itineraries in old age. A greater and more specific impairment of neuromuscular activation, as well as  a specific cognitive and linguistic impairment in dementia, unchain discriminating changes in speech. Yet, there is no consensus on such discriminatory speech parameters, neither on how they should be elicited and assessed.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; automatic analysis; cognitive impairment; computational linguistics; dementia; healthy ageing; language; non-invasive assessment; speech,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech; Healthy Aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Linguistics,"Ivanova, O; Martínez-Nicolás, I; Meilán, JJG"
Automated Medical Diagnosis of Alzheimer´s Disease Using an Efficient Net Convolutional Neural Network.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an enormous challenge to modern healthcare. Since 2017, researchers have been using deep learning (DL) models for the early detection of AD using neuroimaging biomarkers. In this paper, we implement the EfficietNet-b0 convolutional neural network (CNN) with a novel approach-""fusion of end-to-end and transfer learning""-to classify different stages of AD. 245 T1W MRI scans of cognitively normal (CN) subjects, 229 scans of AD subjects, and 229 scans of subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) were employed. Each scan was preprocessed using a standard pipeline. The proposed models were trained and evaluated using preprocessed scans. For the sMCI vs. AD classification task we obtained 95.29% accuracy and 95.35% area under the curve (AUC) for model training and 93.10% accuracy and 93.00% AUC for model testing. For the multiclass AD vs. CN vs. sMCI classification task we obtained 85.66% accuracy and 86% AUC for model training and 87.38% accuracy and 88.00% AUC for model testing. Based on our experimental results, we conclude that CNN-based DL models can be used to analyze complicated MRI scan features in clinical settings.",2023,Alzheimer´s disease; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; EfficientNet; MONAI; MRI; Mild cognitive impairment; Transfer learning,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Early Diagnosis; Cognitive Dysfunction","Agarwal, D; Berbís, MÁ; Luna, A; Lipari, V; Ballester, JB; de la Torre-Díez, I"
AANet: Attentive All-level Fusion Deep Neural Network Approach for Multi-modality Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Multi-modality deep learning models have recently been used for disease diagnosis; however, effectively integrating diverse, complex, and heterogeneous data remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel system, attentive All-level Fusion(AANet), to fuse multi-level and multi-modality patient data, including 3D brain images, patient demographics, genetics, and blood biomarkers into a deep-learning framework for disease diagnosis, and tested it for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. We first constructed a deep learning feature pyramid network for whole-brain brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature extraction. We then leveraged the self-attention-based all-level fusion method by automatically adjusting weights of all-level MRI image features, patient demographics, blood biomarkers, and genetic data. We trained and tested AANet on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for the task of classifying mild cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease, a challenging task in early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. AANet achieved an accuracy of 90.5%, outperformed several state-of-the-art methods. In summary, AANet provides an advanced methodological framework for multi-modality-based disease diagnosis.",2022,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction","Wang, Q; Xu, R"
Characterization of an automated method to segment the human locus coeruleus.,"Following the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to assay the integrity of catecholamine nuclei, including the locus coeruleus (LC), there has been an effort to develop automated methods that can accurately segment this small structure in an automated manner to promote its widespread use and overcome limitations of manual segmentation. Here we characterize an automated LC segmentation approach (referred to as the funnel-tip [FT] method) in healthy individuals and individuals with LC degeneration in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD, confirmed with tau-PET imaging using [18F]MK6240). The first sample included n = 190 individuals across the AD spectrum from cognitively normal to moderate AD. LC signal assayed with FT segmentation showed excellent agreement with manual segmentation (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.91). Compared to other methods, the FT method showed numerically higher correlation to AD status (defined by presence of tau: Cohen's d = 0.64) and AD severity (Braak stage: Pearson R = -.35, cognitive function: R = .25). In a separate sample of n = 12 control participants, the FT method showed excellent scan-rescan reliability (ICC = 0.82). In another sample of n = 30 control participants, we found that the structure of the LC defined by FT segmentation approximated its expected shape as a contiguous line: <5% of LC voxels strayed >1 voxel (0.69 mm) from this line. The FT LC segmentation shows high agreement with manual segmentation and captures LC degeneration in AD. This practical method may facilitate larger research studies of the human LC-norepinephrine system and has potential to support future use of neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a clinical biomarker.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; automated; locus coeruleus; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); norepinephrine system; segmentation,Humans; Locus Coeruleus; Reproducibility of Results; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Norepinephrine,"Sibahi, A; Gandhi, R; Al-Haddad, R; Therriault, J; Pascoal, T; Chamoun, M; Boutin-Miller, K; Tardif, C; Rosa-Neto, P; Cassidy, CM"

Causal feature selection using a knowledge graph combining structured knowledge from the biomedical literature and ontologies: A use case studying depression as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.,"Causal feature selection is essential for estimating effects from observational data. Identifying confounders is a crucial step in this process. Traditionally, researchers employ content-matter expertise and literature review to identify confounders. Uncontrolled confounding from unidentified confounders threatens validity, conditioning on intermediate variables (mediators) weakens estimates, and conditioning on common effects (colliders) induces bias. Additionally, without special treatment, erroneous conditioning on variables combining roles introduces bias. However, the vast literature is growing exponentially, making it infeasible to assimilate this knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel knowledge graph (KG) application enabling causal feature selection by combining computable literature-derived knowledge with biomedical ontologies. We present a use case of our approach specifying a causal model for estimating the total causal effect of depression on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from observational data.",2023,"Alzheimer’s disease; Causal modeling; Depression; Feature selection; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge representation, management, or engineering","Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Depression; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Causality; Risk Factors","Malec, SA; Taneja, SB; Albert, SM; Elizabeth Shaaban, C; Karim, HT; Levine, AS; Munro, P; Callahan, TJ; Boyce, RD"
Cortical thickness is related to cognitive-motor automaticity and attention allocation in individuals with Alzheimer's disease: a regions of interest study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a distinct pattern of cortical thinning and resultant changes in cognition and function. These result in prominent deficits in cognitive-motor automaticity. The relationship between AD-related cortical thinning and decreased automaticity is not well-understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between cortical thickness regions-of-interest (ROI) and automaticity and attention allocation in AD using hypothesis-driven and exploratory approaches. We performed an ROI analysis of 46 patients with AD. Data regarding MR images, demographic characteristics, cognitive-motor dual task performance, and cognition were extracted from medical records. Cortical thickness was calculated from MR T1 images using FreeSurfer. Data from the dual task assessment was used to calculate the combined dual task effect (cDTE), a measure of cognitive-motor automaticity, and the modified attention allocation index (mAAI). Four hierarchical multiple linear regression models were conducted regressing cDTE and mAAI separately on (1) hypothesis-generated ROIs and (2) exploratory ROIs. For cDTE, cortical thicknesses explained 20.5% (p = 0.014) and 25.9% (p = 0.002) variability in automaticity in the hypothesized ROI and exploratory models, respectively. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (β =  - 0.479, p = 0.018) and superior parietal cortex (SPC) (β = 0.467, p = 0.003), and were predictors of automaticity. For mAAI, cortical thicknesses explained 20.7% (p = 0.025) and 28.3% (p = 0.003) variability in attention allocation in the hypothesized ROI and exploratory models, respectively. Thinning of SPC and fusiform gyrus were associated with motor prioritization (β =  - 0.405, p = 0.013 and β =  - 0.632, p = 0.004, respectively), whereas thinning of the DLPFC was associated with cognitive prioritization (β = 0.523, p = 0.022). Cortical thinning in AD was related to cognitive-motor automaticity and task prioritization, particularly in the DLPFC and SPC. This suggests that these regions may play a primary role in automaticity and attentional strategy during dual-tasking.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Automaticity; Cognitive-motor interference; Dual task interference; Prefrontal cortex; Superior parietal cortex,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cerebral Cortex; Cadmium Compounds; Cerebral Cortical Thinning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Quantum Dots; Tellurium; Cognition; Attention,"Longhurst, JK; Sreenivasan, KR; Kim, J; Cummings, JL; John, SE; Poston, B; Cordes, D; Rider, JV; Landers, MR"

Age-related and amyloid-beta-independent tau deposition and its downstream effects.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) is hypothesized to facilitate the spread of tau pathology beyond the medial temporal lobe. However, there is evidence that, independently of Aβ, age-related tau pathology might be present outside of the medial temporal lobe. We therefore aimed to study age-related Aβ-independent tau deposition outside the medial temporal lobe in two large cohorts and to investigate potential downstream effects of this on cognition and structural measures. We included 545 cognitively unimpaired adults (40-92 years) from the BioFINDER-2 study (in vivo) and 639 (64-108 years) from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (ex vivo). 18F-RO948- and 18F-flutemetamol-PET standardized uptake value ratios were calculated for regional tau and global/regional Aβ in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was used to estimate Aβ load and tangle density ex vivo. In vivo medial temporal lobe volumes (subiculum, cornu ammonis 1) and cortical thickness (entorhinal cortex, Brodmann area 35) were obtained using Automated Segmentation for Hippocampal Subfields packages. Thickness of early and late neocortical Alzheimer's disease regions was determined using FreeSurfer. Global cognition and episodic memory were estimated to quantify cognitive functioning. In vivo age-related tau deposition was observed in the medial temporal lobe and in frontal and parietal cortical regions, which was statistically significant when adjusting for Aβ. This was also observed in individuals with low Aβ load. Tau deposition was negatively associated with cortical volumes and thickness in temporal and parietal regions independently of Aβ. The associations between age and cortical volume or thickness were partially mediated via tau in regions with early Alzheimer's disease pathology, i.e. early tau and/or Aβ pathology (subiculum/Brodmann area 35/precuneus/posterior cingulate). Finally, the associations between age and cognition were partially mediated via tau in Brodmann area 35, even when including Aβ-PET as covariate. Results were validated in the ex vivo cohort showing age-related and Aβ-independent increases in tau aggregates in and outside the medial temporal lobe. Ex vivo age-cognition associations were mediated by medial and inferior temporal tau tangle density, while correcting for Aβ density. Taken together, our study provides support for primary age-related tauopathy even outside the medial temporal lobe in vivo and ex vivo, with downstream effects on structure and cognition. These results have implications for our understanding of the spreading of tau outside the medial temporal lobe, also in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, this study suggests the potential utility of tau-targeting treatments in primary age-related tauopathy, likely already in preclinical stages in individuals with low Aβ pathology.",2023,MRI; PART; ageing; amyloid-beta; autoradiography; medial temporal lobe subregions; tau-PET imaging,Adult; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Tauopathies; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Wuestefeld, A; Pichet Binette, A; Berron, D; Spotorno, N; van Westen, D; Stomrud, E; Mattsson-Carlgren, N; Strandberg, O; Smith, R; Palmqvist, S; Glenn, T; Moes, S; Honer, M; Arfanakis, K; Barnes, LL; Bennett, DA; Schneider, JA; Wisse, LEM; Hansson, O"
"Cognitive performance in healthy clinical trial participants and patients with the NeuroCart, a neurodegenerative disease measured with an automated neuropsychological and neurophysiological test battery.","The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases increases significantly with increasing age.

Cognitive performance can therefore also be considered age dependent. The current study investigated if the NeuroCart can detect age related decline on drug-sensitive CNS-tests in healthy volunteers (HV), and whether there are interactions between the rates of decline and sex.

The current state of artificial intelligence-augmented digitized neurocognitive screening test.,"The cognitive screening test is a brief cognitive examination that could be easily performed in a clinical setting. However, one of the main drawbacks of this test was that only a paper-based version was available, which restricts the test to be manually administered and graded by medical personnel at the health centers. The main solution to these problems was to develop a potential remote assessment for screening individuals with cognitive impairment. Currently, multiple studies have been adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology into these tests, evolving the conventional paper-based neurocognitive test into a digitized AI-assisted neurocognitive test.

3d Virtual Histology Reveals Pathological Alterations of Cerebellar Granule Cells in Multiple Sclerosis.,"We investigate structural properties of neurons in the granular layer of human cerebellum with respect to their involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS). To this end we analyze data recorded by X-ray phase contrast tomography from tissue samples collected post mortem from a MS and a healthy control group. Using automated segmentation and histogram analysis based on optimal transport theory (OT) we find that the distributions representing nuclear structure in the granular layer move to a more compact nuclear state, i.e. smaller, denser and more heterogeneous nuclei in MS. We have previously made a similar observation for neurons of the dentate gyrus in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that more compact structure of neuronal nuclei which we attributed to increased levels of heterochromatin, may possibly represent a more general phenomenon of cellular senescence associated with neurodegeneration.",2023,X-ray phase contrast tomography; granule cells; multiple sclerosis; optimal transport,Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurons; Cerebellum; Cellular Senescence; Alzheimer Disease,"Frost, J; Schmitzer, B; Töpperwien, M; Eckermann, M; Franz, J; Stadelmann, C; Salditt, T"
Automatic and manual segmentation of the piriform cortex: Method development and validation in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease.,"The piriform cortex (PC) is located at the junction of the temporal and frontal lobes. It is involved physiologically in olfaction as well as memory and plays an important role in epilepsy. Its study at scale is held back by the absence of automatic segmentation methods on MRI. We devised a manual segmentation protocol for PC volumes, integrated those manually derived images into the Hammers Atlas Database (n = 30) and used an extensively validated method (multi-atlas propagation with enhanced registration, MAPER) for automatic PC segmentation. We applied automated PC volumetry to patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE; n = 174 including n = 58 controls) and to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI; n = 151, of whom with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 71; Alzheimer's disease (AD), n = 33; controls, n = 47).

Use of the electronic medical record to screen for high-risk geriatric patients in the emergency department.,"Older adults with multimorbidities have the highest rate of emergency department (ED) usage. These patients are typically on numerous medications, may have underlying dementia, and often present with falls and delirium. Identifying these high-risk older adults for possible intervention is challenging in the ED setting since available screening methods are manual and resource-intensive. The objective is to study the electronic medical record (EMR) use for identifying high-risk older adults in ED. This feasibility study is conducted in an academic ED with 67 000 total and 24% geriatric (age ≥ 65 years) annual visits, American College of Emergency Physician (ACEP) accredited Level 1 Geriatric Emergency Department with an ED-based geriatric consultation program by incorporating criteria from existing manual geriatric screening instruments and the 4M framework into an automated EMR screen to identify high-risk geriatric patients. ED providers are then alerted by an EMR Best Practice Alert (BPA) if high-risk status is identified. Initial development and impact on geriatric ED consults are reported. During the study period, 7450 patient encounters occurred; 1836 (24.6%) encounters involved patients who were 65 years or older. A total of 1398 (76.1%) high-risk ED encounters resulted in BPA alerts using the EMR automated screen. BPA alerts resulted in 82 (5.9%) geriatric evaluations. We conclude that using the EMR to automate screening for older adults for high-risk geriatric conditions in the ED is feasible. An automated EMR screen with a BPA to ED providers identified a well-defined cohort of older patients appropriate for further ED geriatric evaluation.",2023,automated screening; electronic medical record; geriatric emergency department,,"Saxena, S; Meldon, S; Hashmi, AZ; Muir, M; Ruwe, J"
Evaluating the feasibility of cognitive impairment detection in Alzheimer's disease screening using a computerized visual dynamic test.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease without known cure. However, early medical treatment can help control its progression and postpone intellectual decay.

Attention-Guided Autoencoder for Automated Progression Prediction of Subjective Cognitive Decline With Structural MRI.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which happens even earlier than mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Progressive SCD will convert to MCI with the potential of further evolving to AD. Therefore, early identification of progressive SCD with neuroimaging techniques (e.g., structural MRI) is of great clinical value for early intervention of AD. However, existing MRI-based machine/deep learning methods usually suffer the small-sample-size problem and lack interpretability. To this end, we propose an interpretable autoencoder model with domain transfer learning (IADT) for progression prediction of SCD. Firstly, the proposed model can leverage MRIs from both the target domain (i.e., SCD) and auxiliary domains (e.g., AD and NC) for progressive SCD identification. Besides, it can automatically locate the disease-related brain regions of interest (defined in brain atlases) through an attention mechanism, which shows good interpretability. In addition, the IADT model is straightforward to train and test with only 5  ∼ 10 seconds on CPUs and is suitable for medical tasks with small datasets. Extensive experiments on the publicly available ADNI dataset and a private CLAS dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2023,,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Machine Learning; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression,"Guan, H; Yue, L; Yap, PT; Xiao, S; Bozoki, A; Liu, M"
Risk Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Conversion in Mild Cognitive Impaired Population Based on Brain Age Estimation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the world. To reduce the incidence of AD, it's essential to quantify the AD conversion risk of mild cognitive impaired (MCI) individuals. Here, we propose an AD conversion risk estimation system (CRES), which contains an automated MRI feature extractor, brain age estimation (BAE) module, and AD conversion risk estimation module. The CRES is trained on 634 normal controls (NC) from the public IXI and OASIS cohorts, then it is evaluated on 462 subjects (106 NC, 102 stable MCI (sMCI), 124 progressive MCI (pMCI) and 130 AD) from the ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that the MRI derived age gap (AG, chronological age subtracted from the estimated brain age) significantly distinguish NC, sMCI, pMCI and AD groups with p -value =0.000017 . Considering AG as the primary factor, incorporating gender and Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) for more robust Cox multi-variate hazard analysis, we concluded that each additional year in AG is associated with 4.57% greater AD conversion risk for the MCI group. Furthermore, a nomogram was drawn to describe MCI conversion risk at the individual level in the next 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and even 8 years from baseline. This work demonstrates that CRES can estimate AG based on MRI data, evaluate AD conversion risk of the MCI subjects, and identify the individuals with high AD conversion risk, which is valuable for effective intervention and diagnosis within an early period.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Cognition; Disease Progression,"Liu, W; Dong, Q; Sun, S; Shen, J; Qian, K; Hu, B"
Real-Time Growth Kinetics Analysis of Macromolecular Assemblies in Cells with Single Molecule Resolution.,"Single molecule fluorescence microscopy has the unique advantage to provide real-time information on the spatiotemporal assembly of individual protein complexes in cellular membranes. This includes the assembly of proteins into oligomer species of numerous copy numbers. However, there is a need for improved tracing analysis of the real-time growth kinetics of these assemblies in cells with single molecule resolution. Here, we present an automated analysis software to accurately measure the real-time kinetics of assembly of individual high-order oligomer complexes. Our software comes with a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI), is available as a source code and an executable, and can analyze a full data set of several hundred to thousand molecules in less than 2 minutes. Importantly, this software is suitable for the analysis of intracellular protein oligomers, whose stoichiometry is usually more difficult to quantify due to variability in signal detection in the different areas of the cell. We validated our method with simulated ground-truth data and time-lapse images of diffraction-limited oligomeric assemblies of BAX and BAK proteins on mitochondria of cells undergoing apoptosis. Our approach provides the broad community of biologists with a fast, user-friendly tool to trace the compositional evolution of macromolecular assemblies, and potentially model their growth for a deeper understanding of the structural and biophysical mechanisms underlying their functions.",2023,,Kinetics; Software,"Danial, JSH; Jenner, A; Garcia-Saez, AJ; Cosentino, K"

Reproducible Abnormalities and Diagnostic Generalizability of White Matter in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the impairment of white matter (WM) tracts. The current study aimed to verify the utility of WM as the neuroimaging marker of AD with multisite diffusion tensor imaging datasets [321 patients with AD, 265 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 279 normal controls (NC)], a unified pipeline, and independent site cross-validation. Automated fiber quantification was used to extract diffusion profiles along tracts. Random-effects meta-analyses showed a reproducible degeneration pattern in which fractional anisotropy significantly decreased in the AD and MCI groups compared with NC. Machine learning models using tract-based features showed good generalizability among independent site cross-validation. The diffusion metrics of the altered regions and the AD probability predicted by the models were highly correlated with cognitive ability in the AD and MCI groups.

ERnet: a tool for the semantic segmentation and quantitative analysis of endoplasmic reticulum topology.,"The ability to quantify structural changes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for understanding the structure and function of this organelle. However, the rapid movement and complex topology of ER networks make this challenging. Here, we construct a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method that we call ERnet for the automatic classification of sheet and tubular ER domains inside individual cells. Data are skeletonized and represented by connectivity graphs, enabling precise and efficient quantification of network connectivity. ERnet generates metrics on topology and integrity of ER structures and quantifies structural change in response to genetic or metabolic manipulation. We validate ERnet using data obtained by various ER-imaging methods from different cell types as well as ground truth images of synthetic ER structures.

"Deep learning-based EEG analysis to classify normal, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia: Algorithms and dataset.","For automatic EEG diagnosis, this paper presents a new EEG data set with well-organized clinical annotations called Chung-Ang University Hospital EEG (CAUEEG), which has event history, patient's age, and corresponding diagnosis labels. We also designed two reliable evaluation tasks for the low-cost, non-invasive diagnosis to detect brain disorders: i) CAUEEG-Dementia with normal, mci, and dementia diagnostic labels and ii) CAUEEG-Abnormal with normal and abnormal. Based on the CAUEEG dataset, this paper proposes a new fully end-to-end deep learning model, called the CAUEEG End-to-end Deep neural Network (CEEDNet). CEEDNet pursues to bring all the functional elements for the EEG analysis in a seamless learnable fashion while restraining non-essential human intervention. Extensive experiments showed that our CEEDNet significantly improves the accuracy compared with existing methods, such as machine learning methods and Ieracitano-CNN (Ieracitano et al., 2019), due to taking full advantage of end-to-end learning. The high ROC-AUC scores of 0.9 on CAUEEG-Dementia and 0.86 on CAUEEG-Abnormal recorded by our CEEDNet models demonstrate that our method can lead potential patients to early diagnosis through automatic screening.",2023,Automatic diagnostic system; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Deep learning; Dementia; Electroencephalography (EEG); Mild cognitive impairment (MCI),Humans; Deep Learning; Electroencephalography; Algorithms; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia,"Kim, MJ; Youn, YC; Paik, J"
Altered large-scale dynamic connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment patients: A machine learning study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegeneration disease associated with substantial disruptions in the brain network. However, most studies investigated static resting-state functional connections, while the alteration of dynamic functional connectivity in AD remains largely unknown. This study used group independent component analysis and the sliding-window method to estimate the subject-specific dynamic connectivity states in 1704 individuals from three data sets. Informative inherent states were identified by the multivariate pattern classification method, and classifiers were built to distinguish ADs from normal controls (NCs) and to classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with informative inherent states similar to ADs or not. In addition, MCI subgroups with heterogeneous functional states were examined in the context of different cognition decline trajectories. Five informative states were identified by feature selection, mainly involving functional connectivity belonging to the default mode network and working memory network. The classifiers discriminating AD and NC achieved the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 with leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Alterations in connectivity strength, fluctuation, and inter-synchronization were found in AD and MCIs. Moreover, individuals with MCI were clustered into two subgroups, which had different degrees of atrophy and different trajectories of cognition decline progression. The present study uncovered the alteration of dynamic functional connectivity in AD and highlighted that the dynamic states could be powerful features to discriminate patients from NCs. Furthermore, it demonstrated that these states help to identify MCIs with faster cognition decline and might contribute to the early prevention of AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; classification; dynamic connectivity; functional network,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Machine Learning,"Jing, R; Chen, P; Wei, Y; Si, J; Zhou, Y; Wang, D; Song, C; Yang, H; Zhang, Z; Yao, H; Kang, X; Fan, L; Han, T; Qin, W; Zhou, B; Jiang, T; Lu, J; Han, Y; Zhang, X; Liu, B; Yu, C; Wang, P; Liu, Y"
Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction with MRI Data in Neuroimaging Genetics for Alzheimer's Disease.,"The prognosis and treatment of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been among the most important and challenging problems over the last few decades. To better understand the mechanism of AD, it is of great interest to identify genetic variants associated with brain atrophy. Commonly, in these analyses, neuroimaging features are extracted based on one of many possible brain atlases with FreeSurf and other popular software; this, however, may cause the loss of important information due to our incomplete knowledge about brain function embedded in these suboptimal atlases. To address the issue, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) models applied to three-dimensional MRI data for the whole brain or multiple, divided brain regions to perform completely data-driven and automatic feature extraction. These image-derived features are then used as endophenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify associated genetic variants. When we applied this method to ADNI data, we identified several associated SNPs that have been previously shown to be related to several neurodegenerative/mental disorders, such as AD, depression, and schizophrenia.",2023,CNNs; SNPs; endophenotypes; genome-wide association study (GWAS); principle components (PCs),Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Deep Learning; Genome-Wide Association Study; Neuroimaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Chakraborty, D; Zhuang, Z; Xue, H; Fiecas, MB; Shen, X; Pan, W"

Microglial Phagocytosis/Cell Health High-Content Assay.,"We report a microglial phagocytosis/cell health high-content assay that has been used to test small molecule chemical probes and support our drug discovery projects targeting microglia for Alzheimer's disease therapy. The assay measures phagocytosis and cell health (cell count and nuclear intensity) simultaneously in 384-well plates processed with an automatic liquid handler. The mix-and-read live cell imaging assay is highly reproducible with capacity to meet drug discovery research needs. Assay procedures take 4 days including plating cells, treating cells, adding pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris to cells for phagocytosis, staining cell nuclei before performing high-content imaging, and analysis. Three selected parameters are measured from cells: 1) mean total fluorescence intensity per cell of pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris in phagocytosis vesicles to quantify phagocytosis; 2) cell counts per well (measuring compound effects on proliferation and cell death); and 3) average nuclear intensity (measuring compound induced apoptosis). The assay has been used on HMC3 cells (an immortalized human microglial cell line), BV2 cells (an immortalized mouse microglial cell line), and primary microglia isolated from mouse brains. Simultaneous measurements of phagocytosis and cell health allow for the distinction of compound effects on regulation of phagocytosis from cellular stress/toxicity related changes, a distinguishing feature of the assay. The combination of cell counts and nuclear intensity as indicators of cell health is also an effective way to measure cell stress and compound cytotoxicity, which may have broad applications as simultaneous profiling measurements for other phenotypic assays. © 2023 The Authors.

The Future of Cognitive Screening in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Cognitive screening instruments (CSI) have variable sensitivity and specificity to the cognitive changes associated with dementia syndromes, and the most recent systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the benefit of cognitive screening tools in older adults residing within the community. Consequently, there is a critical need to improve CSI methods, which have not yet incorporated advances in psychometrics, neuroscience, and technology. The primary goal of this article is to provide a framework for transitioning from legacy CSIs to advanced dementia screening measurement. In line with ongoing efforts in neuropsychology and the call for next-generation digital assessment for early detection of AD, we propose a psychometrically advanced (including application of item response theory methods), automated selective assessment model that provides a framework to help propel an assessment revolution.

An unsupervised learning approach to diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using brain magnetic resonance imaging scans.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterised by behavioural and cognitive impairment. Due to the lack of effectiveness of manual diagnosis by doctors, machine learning is now being applied to diagnose AD in many recent studies. Most research developing machine learning algorithms to diagnose AD use supervised learning to classify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

Learnings about Aβ from human brain recommend the use of a live-neuron bioassay for the discovery of next generation Alzheimer's disease immunotherapeutics.,"Despite ongoing debate, the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) remains the prime therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, rational drug design has been hampered by a lack of knowledge about neuroactive Aβ. To help address this deficit, we developed live-cell imaging of iPSC-derived human neurons (iNs) to study the effects of the most disease relevant form of Aβ-oligomeric assemblies (oAβ) extracted from AD brain. Of ten brains studied, extracts from nine caused neuritotoxicity, and in eight cases this was abrogated by Aβ immunodepletion. Here we show that activity in this bioassay agrees relatively well with disruption of hippocampal long-term potentiation, a correlate of learning and memory, and that measurement of neurotoxic oAβ can be obscured by more abundant non-toxic forms of Aβ. These findings indicate that the development of novel Aβ targeting therapeutics may benefit from unbiased activity-based discovery. To test this principle, we directly compared 5 clinical antibodies (aducanumab, bapineuzumab,  BAN2401, gantenerumab, and SAR228810) together with an in-house aggregate-preferring antibody (1C22) and established relative EC",2023,Amyloid β-protein; Automated live-cell imaging; Immunotherapy; Long-term potentiation; Monoclonal antibodies; Neuritic dystrophy; Soluble aggregates,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Immunotherapy; Neurons,"Wang, Z; Jin, M; Hong, W; Liu, W; Reczek, D; Lagomarsino, VN; Hu, Y; Weeden, T; Frosch, MP; Young-Pearse, TL; Pradier, L; Selkoe, D; Walsh, DM"
Task-Evoked Pupillary Response as a Potential Biomarker of Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Scoping Review.,"Pupil dilation functions as a proxy for cognitive effort and can be measured through automated pupillometry. The aim of this scoping review is to examine how individuals with cognitive impairment differ in task-evoked pupillary responses relative to cognitively healthy individuals. A systematic literature search across six databases was conducted to identify studies examining changes in pupillary responses evoked by cognitive tasks comparing patients with dementia to healthy controls. Eight articles met inclusion criteria and were included for review. Differences in task-evoked pupillary response between cognitively impaired and cognitively healthy participants were observed across studies. Pupil dilation is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's Disease compared to controls, with no difference observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment. A mild, non-significant trend towards reduced pupil dilation in patients with either Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies suggests a similar but less pronounced effect than in AD patients. Further research is required to examine the utility of task-evoked pupillary responses as a potential biomarker indexing cognitive decline in individuals transitioning to mild cognitive impairment and/or dementia.",2023,biomarker; cognitive task; dementia; early detection; pupillometry,Humans; Pupil; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Biomarkers,"Zeeman, M; Figeys, M; Brimmo, T; Burnstad, C; Hao, J; Kim, ES"
Automatic Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Deep Learning Models and Neuro-Imaging: Current Trends and Future Perspectives.,"Deep learning algorithms have a huge influence on tackling research issues in the field of medical image processing. It acts as a vital aid for the radiologists in producing accurate results toward effective disease diagnosis. The objective of this research is to highlight the importance of deep learning models in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The main objective of this research is to analyze different deep learning methods used for detecting AD. This study examines 103 research articles published in various research databases. These articles have been selected based on specific criteria to find the most relevant findings in the field of AD detection. The review was carried out based on deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transfer Learning (TL). To propose accurate methods for the detection, segmentation, and severity grading of AD, the radiological features need to be examined in greater depth. This review attempts to analyze different deep learning methods applied for AD detection using neuroimaging modalities like Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc. The focus of this review is restricted to deep learning works based on radiological imaging data for AD detection. There are a few works that have utilized other biomarkers to understand the effect of AD. Also, articles published in English were alone considered for analysis. This work concludes by highlighting the key research issues towards effective AD detection. Though several methods have yielded promising results in AD detection, the progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD need to be analyzed in greater depth using DL models.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Segmentation,"Humans; Deep Learning; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Cognitive Dysfunction","Illakiya, T; Karthik, R"
Alzheimer' disease prediction and classification using CT images through machine learning.,"Numerous surveys using different techniques have been conducted in recent years to accurately classify Alzheimer's disease (AD). This research emphasized the identification of AD through neuroimaging data. However, it is important to identify symptoms as soon as possible when the disease-modifying medications function best during infection before a permanent cognitive impairment develops. The use of automated algorithms to detect the early symptom of AD to this information was very important.

The effects of white matter hyperintensities on MEG power spectra in population with mild cognitive impairment.,"Cerebrovascular disease is responsible for up to 20% of cases of dementia worldwide, but also it is a major comorbid contributor to the progression of other neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are the most prevalent imaging marker in cerebrovascular disease. The presence and progression of WMH in the brain have been associated with general cognitive impairment and the risk to develop all types of dementia. The aim of this piece of work is the assessment of brain functional differences in an MCI population based on the WMH volume. One-hundred and twenty-nine individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent a neuropsychological evaluation, MRI assessment (T1 and Flair), and MEG recordings (5 min of eyes closed resting state).

Class activation attention transfer neural networks for MCI conversion prediction.,"Accurate prediction of the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from an early stage is of substantial value for treatment and planning to delay the onset of AD. We propose a novel attention transfer method to train a 3D convolutional neural network to predict which patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to AD within 3 years. A model is first trained on a separate but related source task (task we are transferring information from) to automatically learn regions of interest (ROI) from a given image. Next we train a model to simultaneously classify progressive MCI (pMCI) and stable MCI (sMCI) (the target task we want to solve) and the ROIs learned from the source task. The predicted ROIs are then used to focus the model's attention on certain areas of the brain when classifying pMCI versus sMCI. Thus, in contrast to traditional transfer learning, we transfer attention maps instead of transferring model weights from a source task to the target classification task. Our Method outperformed all methods tested including traditional transfer learning and methods that used expert knowledge to define ROI. Furthermore, the attention map transferred from the source task highlights known Alzheimer's pathology.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Attention mechanism; Class activation maps; Convolutional neural networks; Mild Cognitive impairment; Prediction,"Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neural Networks, Computer; Brain; Attention; Alzheimer Disease","Luo, M; He, Z; Cui, H; Chen, YP; Ward, P"

Regulating the disenfranchised: Reciprocity & resistance under the Mental Capacity Act.,"This paper interrogates the legitimacy of formal ethical regulation regarding people with dementia under the Mental Capacity Act, 2005 in England and Wales. Under the Act, research among people diagnosed with dementia must be approved by Health Research Authority committees, irrespective of whether that research engages with health organisations or service users. As examples, I discuss two ethnographic dementia studies that do not engage with healthcare services, but which nonetheless require HRA approval. These instances raise questions regarding legitimacy and reciprocity in the governance of dementia. Through capacity legislation, the state exerts control over people with dementia, automatically delineating them as healthcare subjects because of their diagnoses. This diagnosis functions as a form of administrative medicalisation, rendering dementia a medical entity and those diagnosed with it the property of formal healthcare. However, many people with dementia in England and Wales do not receive related health or care services beyond diagnosis. This institutional imbalance of high governance and low support undermines the contractual citizenship of people with dementia, wherein state-citizen rights and responsibilities should be reciprocal. In response, I consider resistance to this system in ethnographic research. ""Resistance"" here is not necessarily deliberate, hostile, difficult or perceived, but rather encompasses micropolitical effects that are contrary to power or control, sometimes emerging from systems themselves rather than individual resistive actors. Resistance can be unintentional, through mundane failures to satisfy specific aspects of governance bureaucracies. It can also be deliberate, through refusals to comply with restrictions that seem cumbersome, inapplicable or unethical, potentially raising questions of malpractice and misconduct. I suggest that resistance is made more probable due to the expansion of governance bureaucracies. On the one hand, the potential for both unintentional and intentional transgression increases, while on the other hand, the capacity for those transgressions to be discovered and rectified decreases, because the maintenance of control over such a system requires vast resources. Behind this ethico-bureaucratic tumult, people with dementia themselves are largely invisible. People with dementia often have no interaction with committees that determine their research participation. This further renders ethical governance a particularly disenfranchising facet of the dementia research economy. The state stipulates that people with dementia must be treated differently because of their diagnoses, without consulting those people. In response, resistance to unethical governance could be intuitively deemed ethical per se, but I suggest that such a simplistic binary is somewhat misleading.",2023,Alzheimer; Dementia; Ethics; IRB; MCA; REC,"Humans; Anthropology, Cultural; England; Health Facilities; Dementia","Fletcher, JR"

Frailty detection among primary care older patients through the Primary Care Frailty Index (PC-FI).,"The prompt identification of frailty in primary care is the first step to offer personalized care to older individuals. We aimed to detect and quantify frailty among primary care older patients, by developing and validating a primary care frailty index (PC-FI) based on routinely collected health records and providing sex-specific frailty charts. The PC-FI was developed using data from 308,280 primary care patients ≥ 60 years old part of the Health Search Database (HSD) in Italy (baseline 2013-2019) and validated in the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K; baseline 2001-2004), a well-characterized population-based cohort including 3363 individuals ≥ 60 years old. Potential health deficits part of the PC-FI were identified through ICD-9, ATC, and exemption codes and selected through an optimization algorithm (i.e., genetic algorithm), using all-cause mortality as the main outcome for the PC-FI development. The PC-FI association at 1, 3 and 5 years, and discriminative ability for mortality and hospitalization were tested in Cox models. The convergent validity with frailty-related measures was verified in SNAC-K. The following cut-offs were used to define absent, mild, moderate and severe frailty: < 0.07, 0.07-0.14, 0.14-0.21, and ≥ 0.21. Mean age of HSD and SNAC-K participants was 71.0 years (55.4% females). The PC-FI included 25 health deficits and showed an independent association with mortality (hazard ratio range 2.03-2.27; p < 0.05) and hospitalization (hazard ratio range 1.25-1.64; p < 0.05) and a fair-to-good discriminative ability (c-statistics range 0.74-0.84 for mortality and 0.59-0.69 for hospitalization). In HSD 34.2%, 10.9% and 3.8% were deemed mildly, moderately, and severely frail, respectively. In the SNAC-K cohort, the associations between PC-FI and mortality and hospitalization were stronger than in the HSD and PC-FI scores were associated with physical frailty (odds ratio 4.25 for each 0.1 increase; p < 0.05; area under the curve 0.84), poor physical performance, disability, injurious falls, and dementia. Almost 15% of primary care patients ≥ 60 years old are affected by moderate or severe frailty in Italy.

Local white matter abnormalities in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment: Assessed with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging.,"Mild cognitive impairment is a nonmotor complication in Parkinson's disease (PD) that have a high risk of developing dementia. White matter is associated with cognitive function in PD and the alterations may occur before the symptoms of the disease. Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies lacked specificity to characterize the concrete contributions of distinct white matter tissue properties. This may lead to inconsistent conclusions about the alteration of white matter microstructure. Here, we used neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and white matter fiber clustering method to uncover local white matter microstructures in PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). This study included 23 PD-MCI and 20 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and 21 healthy controls (HC). To probe specific and fine-grained differences, metrics of NODDI and DTI in white matter fiber clusters were evaluated using along-tract analysis. Our results showed that PD-MCI patients had significantly lower neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) in white matter fiber clusters in the prefrontal region. Correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the diagnostic performance of NODDI-derived metrics in cingulum bundle (2 clusters) and thalamo-frontal (2 clusters) were superior to DTI metrics. Our study provides a more specific insight to uncover local white matter abnormalities in PD-MCI, which benefit understanding the underlying mechanism of cognitive decline in PD and predicting the disease in advance.",2023,Parkinson's disease; along-tract analysis; cognitive impairment; neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging; white matter microstructure,Humans; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Neurites; White Matter; Brain; Parkinson Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Zhang, C; Yuan, Y; Sang, T; Yu, L; Yu, Y; Liu, X; Zhou, W; Zeng, Q; Wang, J; Peng, G; Feng, Y"

Using CNN Saliency Maps and EEG Modulation Spectra for Improved and More Interpretable Machine Learning-Based Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Biomarkers based on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals have emerged as a promising tool in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, a state-of-the-art biomarker was found based on visual inspection of power modulation spectrograms where three ""patches"" or regions from the modulation spectrogram were proposed and used for AD diagnostics. Here, we propose the use of deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with saliency maps, trained on power modulation spectrogram inputs to find optimal patches in a data-driven manner. Experiments are conducted on EEG data collected from fifty-four participants, including 20 healthy controls, 19 patients with mild AD, and 15 moderate-to-severe AD patients. Five classification tasks are explored, including the three-class problem, early-stage detection (control vs. mild-AD), and severity level detection (mild vs. moderate-to-severe). Experimental results show the proposed biomarkers outperform the state-of-the-art benchmark across all five tasks, as well as finding complementary modulation spectrogram regions not previously seen via visual inspection. Lastly, experiments are conducted on the proposed biomarkers to test their sensitivity to age, as this is a known confound in AD characterization. Across all five tasks, none of the proposed biomarkers showed a significant relationship with age, thus further highlighting their usefulness for automated AD diagnostics.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Electroencephalography","Lopes, M; Cassani, R; Falk, TH"

Supporting the Detection of Early Alzheimer's Disease with a Four-Channel EEG Analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. Although there is no current cure, medical treatment can help to control its progression. Hence, early-stage diagnosis is crucial to maximize the living standards of the patients. Biochemical markers and medical imaging in combination with neuropsychological tests represent the most extended diagnosis procedure. However, these techniques require specialized personnel and long processing time. Furthermore, the access to some of these techniques is often limited in crowded healthcare systems and rural areas. In this context, electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique to obtain endogenous brain information, has been proposed for the diagnosis of early-stage AD. Despite the valuable information provided by clinical EEG and high density montages, these approaches are impractical in conditions such as those described above. Consequently, in this study, we evaluated the feasibly of using a reduced EEG montage with only four channels to detect early-stage AD. For this purpose, we involved eight clinically diagnosed AD patients and eight healthy controls. The results we obtained reveal similar accuracies ([Formula: see text]-value[Formula: see text]0.66) for the reduced montage (0.86) and a 16-channel montage (0.87). This suggests that a four-channel wearable EEG system could be an effective tool for supporting early-stage AD detection.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; artificial intelligence; automated detection; reduced EEG montage; wearable EEG,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Electroencephalography; Brain; Brain Mapping,"Perez-Valero, E; Morillas, C; Lopez-Gordo, MA; Minguillon, J"
"Review and comparison of retinal vessel calibre and geometry software and their application to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia.","Developments in retinal imaging technologies have enabled the quantitative evaluation of the retinal vasculature. Changes in retinal calibre and/or geometry have been reported in systemic vascular diseases, including diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and more recently in neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. Several retinal vessel analysis softwares exist, some being disease-specific, others for a broader context. In the research setting, retinal vasculature analysis using semi-automated software has identified associations between retinal vessel calibre and geometry and the presence of or risk of DM and its chronic complications, and of CVD and dementia, including in the general population. In this article, we review and compare the most widely used semi-automated retinal vessel analysis softwares and their associations with ocular imaging findings in common systemic diseases, including DM and its chronic complications, CVD, and dementia. We also provide original data comparing retinal calibre grading in people with Type 1 DM using two softwares, with good concordance.",2023,Cardiovascular disease; Dementia; Diabetes; Diabetic retinopathy; Retinal vessel assessment; Software,"Humans; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetic Retinopathy; Retinal Vessels; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Dementia","Brazionis, L; Quinn, N; Dabbah, S; Ryan, CD; Møller, DM; Richardson, H; Keech, AC; Januszewski, AS; Grauslund, J; Rasmussen, ML; Peto, T; Jenkins, AJ"
Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the Clock Drawing Test to Reveal the Cognitive Impairment Pattern.,"The prevalence of dementia is currently increasing worldwide. This syndrome produces a deterioration in cognitive function that cannot be reverted. However, an early diagnosis can be crucial for slowing its progress. The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is a widely used paper-and-pencil test for cognitive assessment in which an individual has to manually draw a clock on a paper. There are a lot of scoring systems for this test and most of them depend on the subjective assessment of the expert. This study proposes a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze the CDT and obtain an automatic diagnosis of cognitive impairment (CI). This system employs a preprocessing pipeline in which the clock is detected, centered and binarized to decrease the computational burden. Then, the resulting image is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the informative patterns within the CDT drawings that are relevant for the assessment of the patient's cognitive status. Performance is evaluated in a real context where patients with CI and controls have been classified by clinical experts in a balanced sample size of [Formula: see text] drawings. The proposed method provides an accuracy of [Formula: see text] in the binary case-control classification task, with an AUC of [Formula: see text]. These results are indeed relevant considering the use of the classic version of the CDT. The large size of the sample suggests that the method proposed has a high reliability to be used in clinical contexts and demonstrates the suitability of CAD systems in the CDT assessment process. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods are applied to identify the most relevant regions during classification. Finding these patterns is extremely helpful to understand the brain damage caused by CI. A validation method using resubstitution with upper bound correction in a machine learning approach is also discussed.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Clock drawing test; clinical diagnosis; cognitive impairment; computer-aided diagnosis; deep learning; explainable AI; image processing; machine learning,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests,"Jiménez-Mesa, C; Arco, JE; Valentí-Soler, M; Frades-Payo, B; Zea-Sevilla, MA; Ortiz, A; Ávila-Villanueva, M; Castillo-Barnes, D; Ramírez, J; Del Ser-Quijano, T; Carnero-Pardo, C; Górriz, JM"
Population cause of death estimation using verbal autopsy methods in large-scale field trials of maternal and child health: lessons learned from a 20-year research collaboration in Central Ghana.,"Low and middle-income countries continue to use Verbal autopsies (VAs) as a World Health Organisation-recommended method to ascertain causes of death in settings where coverage of vital registration systems is not yet comprehensive. Whilst the adoption of VA has resulted in major improvements in estimating cause-specific mortality in many settings, well documented limitations have been identified relating to the standardisation of the processes involved. The WHO has invested significant resources into addressing concerns in some of these areas; there however remains enduring challenges particularly in operationalising VA surveys for deaths amongst women and children, challenges which have measurable impacts on the quality of data collected and on the accuracy of determining the final cause of death. In this paper we describe some of our key experiences and recommendations in conducting VAs from over two decades of evaluating seminal trials of maternal and child health interventions in rural Ghana. We focus on challenges along the entire VA pathway that can impact on the success rates of ascertaining the final cause of death, and lessons we have learned to optimise the procedures. We highlight our experiences of the value of the open history narratives in VAs and the training and skills required to optimise the quality of the information collected. We describe key issues in methods for ascertaining cause of death and argue that both automated and physician-based methods can be valid depending on the setting. We further summarise how increasingly popular information technology methods may be used to facilitate the processes described. Verbal autopsy is a vital means of increasing the coverage of accurate mortality statistics in low- and middle-income settings, however operationalisation remains problematic. The lessons we share here in conducting VAs within a long-term surveillance system in Ghana will be applicable to researchers and policymakers in many similar settings.",2023,Child health; Child mortality; Death registration; Maternal mortality; Maternal neonatal and child health; Neonatal mortality; Verbal autopsy; Verbal post-mortem; Vital registration; Vital statistics,,"Danso, SO; Manu, A; Fenty, J; Amanga-Etego, S; Avan, BI; Newton, S; Soremekun, S; Kirkwood, B"

To study the progression of language, there is a need for open-access databases that can be used to build algorithms to produce translational models sensitive enough to detect early declines in language abilities. DementiaBank is an open-access repository of transcribed video/audio data from communicative interactions from people with dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls.

Fully automatic carotid arterial stiffness assessment from ultrasound videos based on machine learning.,"Arterial stiffness (AS) refers to the loss of arterial compliance and alterations in vessel wall properties. The study of local carotid stiffness (CS) is particularly important since carotid artery stiffening raises the risk of stroke, cognitive impairment, and dementia. So, stiffness measurement as a screening tool approach is crucial because it can reduce mortality and facilitate therapy planning. This study aims to evaluate the stiffness of the CCA using machine learning (ML) through the features of diameter change (ΔD) and stiffness parameters. This study was conducted in seven stages: data collection, preprocessing, CCA segmentation, CCA lumen diameter (DCCA) computing during cardiac cycles, denoising signals of DCCA, computational of AS parameters, and stiffness assessment using ML. The 51 videos (with 25 s) of CCA B-mode ultrasound (US) were used and analyzed. Each US video yielded approximately 750 sequential frames spanning about 24 cardiac cycles. Firstly, US preset settings with time gain compensation with a U-pattern were employed to enhance CCA segmentations. The study showed that auto region-growing, employed three times, is appropriate for segmenting walls with a short running time (4.56 s/frame). The diameter computed for frames constructs a signal (diameter signal) with noisy parts in the shape of peak variance and an un-smooth side. Among the 12 employed smoothing methods, spline fitting with a mean peak difference per cycle (MPDCY) of 0.58 pixels was the most effective for the diameter signal. The authors propose the MPDCY as a new selection criterion for smoothing methods with highly preserved peaks.

With life there is motion. Activity biomarkers signal important health and performance outcomes.,"Measures of human motion provide a rich source of health and physiological status information. This paper provides examples of motion-based biomarkers in the form of patterns of movement, quantified physical activity, and characteristic gaits that can now be assessed with practical measurement technologies and rapidly evolving physiological models and algorithms, with research advances fed by the increasing access to motion data and associated contextual information. Quantification of physical activity has progressed from step counts to good estimates of energy expenditure, useful to weight management and to activity-based health outcomes. Activity types and intensity durations are important to health outcomes and can be accurately classified even from carried smart phone data. Specific gaits may predict injury risk, including some re-trainable injurious running or modifiable load carriage gaits. Mood status is reflected in specific types of human movement, with slumped posture and shuffling gait signaling depression. Increased variability in body sway combined with contextual information may signify heat strain, physical fatigue associated with heavy load carriage, or specific neuropsychological conditions. Movement disorders might be identified earlier and chronic diseases such as Parkinson's can be better medically managed with automatically quantified information from wearable systems. Increased path tortuosity suggests head injury and dementia. Rapidly emerging wear-and-forget systems involving global positioning system and inertial navigation, triaxial accelerometry, smart shoes, and functional fiber-based clothing are making it easier to make important health and performance outcome associations, and further refine predictive models and algorithms that will improve quality of life, protect health, and enhance performance.",2023,Accelerometry; Energy expenditure; Musculoskeletal injury; Pattern recognition; Physiological models; Wearable monitoring technologies,Humans; Quality of Life; Movement; Exercise; Posture; Biomarkers,"Friedl, KE; Looney, DP"
Convolution Neural Networks and Self-Attention Learners for Alzheimer Dementia Diagnosis from Brain MRI.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can help in the early detection of associated cognitive impairment. The aim of this work is to improve the automatic detection of dementia in MRI brain data. For this purpose, we used an established pipeline that includes the registration, slicing, and classification steps. The contribution of this research was to investigate for the first time, to our knowledge, three current and promising deep convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet) and two transformer-based architectures (MAE and DeiT) for mapping input images to clinical diagnosis. To allow a fair comparison, the experiments were performed on two publicly available datasets (ADNI and OASIS) using multiple benchmarks obtained by changing the number of slices per subject extracted from the available 3D voxels. The experiments showed that very deep ResNet and DenseNet models performed better than the shallow ResNet and VGG versions tested in the literature. It was also found that transformer architectures, and DeiT in particular, produced the best classification results and were more robust to the noise added by increasing the number of slices. A significant improvement in accuracy (up to 7%) was achieved compared to the leading state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for the use of CAD approaches in real-world applications.",2023,MRI; assistive technology; computer-aided diagnosis; deep learning; masked auto-encoders; medical image analysis; vision transformers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Deep Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain","Carcagnì, P; Leo, M; Del Coco, M; Distante, C; De Salve, A"

Prototype-guided multi-scale domain adaptation for Alzheimer's disease detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and there is no effective treatment currently. Using artificial intelligence technology to assist the diagnosis and intervention as early as possible is of great significance to delay the development of AD. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) has shown great practical values on computer-aided AD diagnosis. Affected by data from different sources or acquisition domains in realistic scenarios, MRI data often suffer from domain shift problem. In this paper, we propose a deep Prototype-Guided Multi-Scale Domain Adaptation (PMDA) framework to handle MRI data with domain shift problem, and realize automatic auxiliary diagnosis of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Cognitively Normal (CN). PMDA is composed of three modules: (1) MRI multi-scale feature extraction module combines the advantages of 3D convolution and self-attention to effectively extract multi-scale features in high-dimensional space, (2) Prototype Maximum Density Divergence (Pro-MDD) module adopts prototype learning to constrain the feature outlier samples in a mini-batch when MDD is used to align source domain and target domain, and (3) Adversarial Domain Adaptation module is applied to achieve global feature alignment of the source domain and target domain and co-training two distinctive discriminators to mitigate the over-fitting issue. Experiments have been performed on 3T and 1.5T sMRI with domain shift in ADNI dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework PMDA outperforms supervised learning methods and several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods and achieves a superior accuracy of 92.11%, 76.01% and 82.37% on AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. CN tasks, respectively.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Domain adaptation; Feature alignment; Multi-scale; Prototype MDD; Structural MRI,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction","Cai, H; Zhang, Q; Long, Y"

Distinct spatiotemporal subtypes of amyloid deposition are associated with diverging disease profiles in cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment individuals.,"We aimed to investigate the relationship between spatiotemporal changes of amyloid deposition and Alzheimer's disease (AD) profiles in cognitively normal (CN) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using a data-driven method and amyloid-PET data, we identified and validated two subtypes in two independent datasets (discovery dataset: N = 548, age = 72.4 ± 6.78, 49% female; validation dataset: N = 348, age = 74.9 ± 8.16, 47% female) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative across a range of individuals who were CN or had MCI. The two subtypes showed distinct regional progression patterns and presented distinct genetic, clinical and biomarker characteristics. The cortex-priority subtype was more likely to show typical clinical syndromes of symptomatic AD and vice versa. Furthermore, the regional progression patterns were associated with clinical and biomarker profiles. In sum, our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal variants of amyloid depositions are in close association with disease trajectories; these findings may provide insight into the disease monitoring and enrollment of therapeutic trials in AD.",2023,,"Humans; Female; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cerebral Cortex; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Progression; Positron-Emission Tomography","Sun, Y; Zhao, Y; Hu, K; Wang, M; Liu, Y; Liu, B"

Machine Learning for Dementia Prediction: A Systematic Review and Future Research Directions.,"Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have successfully provided automated solutions to numerous real-world problems. Healthcare is one of the most important research areas for ML researchers, with the aim of developing automated disease prediction systems. One of the disease detection problems that AI and ML researchers have focused on is dementia detection using ML methods. Numerous automated diagnostic systems based on ML techniques for early prediction of dementia have been proposed in the literature. Few systematic literature reviews (SLR) have been conducted for dementia prediction based on ML techniques in the past. However, these SLR focused on a single type of data modality for the detection of dementia. Hence, the purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ML-based automated diagnostic systems considering different types of data modalities such as images, clinical-features, and voice data.

Dry Chemistry-Based Bipolar Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay Device for Point-of-Care Testing of Alzheimer-Associated Neuronal Thread Protein.,"In this study, we developed, for the first time, a novel dry chemistry-based bipolar electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay device for point-of-care testing (POCT) of Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP), where the ECL signals were automatically collected and analyzed after the sample and buffer solutions were manually added onto the immunosensor. The proposed immunoassay device contains an automatic ECL analyzer and a dry chemistry-based ECL immunosensor fabricated with a screen-printed fiber material-based chip and a three-dimensional (3D)-printed shell. Each pad of the fiber material-based chip was premodified with certain reagents for immunoreaction and then assembled to form the ECL immunosensor. The self-enhanced ECL of the Ru(II)-poly-l-lysine complex and the lateral flow fiber material-based chip make the addition of coreactants and repeated flushing unnecessary. Only the sample and buffer solutions are added to the ECL immunosensor, and the process of ECL detection can be completed in about 6 min using the proposed automatic ECL analyzer.

Peak Width of Skeletonized Mean Diffusivity: A Neuroimaging Marker for White Matter Injury.,"A leading cause of white matter (WM) injury in older individuals is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Cerebral SVD is the most prevalent vascular contributor to cognitive impairment and dementia. Therapeutic progress for cerebral SVD and other WM disorders depends on the development and validation of neuroimaging markers suitable as outcome measures in future interventional trials. Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) is one of the best-suited MRI techniques for assessing the extent of WM damage in the brain. But the optimal method to analyze individual DTI data remains hindered by labor-intensive and time-consuming processes. Peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), a recently developed fast, fully automated DTI marker, was designed to quantify the WM damage secondary to cerebral SVD and reflect related cognitive impairment. Despite its promising results, knowledge about PSMD is still limited in the radiologic community. This focused review provides an overview of the technical details of PSMD while synthesizing the available data on its clinical and neuroimaging associations.

Identification of Alzheimer's Disease by Imaging: A Comprehensive Review.,"In developing countries, there is more concern for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by public health professionals due to its catastrophic effects on the elderly. Early detection of this disease helps in starting the therapy soon and slows down the progression of the disease. Imaging techniques are considered to be the best solutions for its detection. Brain imaging was initially used to diagnose AD. Different techniques for identifying protein accumulation in the nervous system, a sign of Alzheimer's disease, are identified by MRI imaging. Although they were initially attributed to cortical dysfunction, visual system impairments in Alzheimer's patients were also found in the early 1970s. Several non-invasive approaches reported for screening, prevention, and therapy were unsuccessful. It is vitally necessary to develop new diagnostic methods in order to accurately identify patients who are in the early stages of this disease. It would be wonderful to have a quick, non-invasive, affordable, and easily scalable Alzheimer's disease screening. Researchers may be able to identify biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and understand more about its aetiology with imaging and data processing. This study clarifies the need for medical image processing and analysis strategies which aid in the non-invasive diagnosis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; image reconstruction; image registration; image segmentation; medical imaging; non-invasive method,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain,"T, P; V, S"
Precise Discrimination for Multiple Etiologies of Dementia Cases Based on Deep Learning with Electroencephalography.,"It is critical to develop accurate and universally available biomarkers for dementia diseases to appropriately deal with the dementia problems under world-wide rapid increasing of patients with dementia. In this sense, electroencephalography (EEG) has been utilized as a promising examination to screen and assist in diagnosing dementia, with advantages of sensitiveness to neural functions, inexpensiveness, and high availability.

Screening of Mild Cognitive Impairment Through Conversations With Humanoid Robots: Exploratory Pilot Study.,"The rising number of patients with dementia has become a serious social problem worldwide. To help detect dementia at an early stage, many studies have been conducted to detect signs of cognitive decline by prosodic and acoustic features. However, many of these methods are not suitable for everyday use as they focus on cognitive function or conversational speech during the examinations. In contrast, conversational humanoid robots are expected to be used in the care of older people to help reduce the work of care and monitoring through interaction.",2023,Alzheimer disease; humanoid robot; mild cognitive impairment; monitoring; neuropsychiatric symptoms; neuropsychological; neuropsychological assessment; robot; simple screening; symptoms,,"Yoshii, K; Kimura, D; Kosugi, A; Shinkawa, K; Takase, T; Kobayashi, M; Yamada, Y; Nemoto, M; Watanabe, R; Ota, M; Higashi, S; Nemoto, K; Arai, T; Nishimura, M"
A unified global tractography framework for automatic visual pathway reconstruction.,"The human visual pathway starts from the retina, passes through the retinogeniculate visual pathway, the optic radiation, and finally connects to the primary visual cortex. Diffusion MRI tractography is the only technology that can noninvasively reconstruct the visual pathway. However, complete and accurate visual pathway reconstruction is challenging because of the skull base environment and complex fiber geometries. Specifically, the optic nerve within the complex skull base environment can cause abnormal diffusion signals. The crossing and fanning fibers at the optic chiasm, and a sharp turn of Meyer's loop at the optic radiation, contribute to complex fiber geometries of the visual pathway. A fiber trajectory distribution (FTD) function-based tractography method of our previous work and several high sensitivity tractography methods can reveal these complex fiber geometries, but are accompanied by false-positive fibers. Thus, the related studies of the visual pathway mostly applied the expert region of interest selection strategy. However, interobserver variability is an issue in reconstructing an accurate visual pathway. In this paper, we propose a unified global tractography framework to automatically reconstruct the visual pathway. We first extend the FTD function to a high-order streamline differential equation for global trajectory estimation. At the global level, the tractography process is simplified as the estimation of global trajectory distribution coefficients by minimizing the cost between trajectory distribution and the selected directions under the prior guidance by introducing the tractography template as anatomic priors. Furthermore, we use a deep learning-based method and tractography template prior information to automatically generate the mask for tractography. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully reconstruct the visual pathway with high accuracy.",2023,Human Connectome Project; differential equation; diffusion MRI; tractography; visual pathway,Humans; Visual Pathways; Frontotemporal Dementia; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"He, J; Yao, S; Zeng, Q; Chen, J; Sang, T; Xie, L; Pan, Y; Feng, Y"

Ensemble feature selection with data-driven thresholding for Alzheimer's disease biomarker discovery.,"Feature selection is often used to identify the important features in a dataset but can produce unstable results when applied to high-dimensional data. The stability of feature selection can be improved with the use of feature selection ensembles, which aggregate the results of multiple base feature selectors. However, a threshold must be applied to the final aggregated feature set to separate the relevant features from the redundant ones. A fixed threshold, which is typically used, offers no guarantee that the final set of selected features contains only relevant features. This work examines a selection of data-driven thresholds to automatically identify the relevant features in an ensemble feature selector and evaluates their predictive accuracy and stability. Ensemble feature selection with data-driven thresholding is applied to two real-world studies of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure, that begins at least 2-3 decades before overt symptoms appear, presenting an opportunity for researchers to identify early biomarkers that might identify patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Data-driven thresholding; Ensemble feature selection; Stability,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Biomarkers; Algorithms; Computational Biology,"Spooner, A; Mohammadi, G; Sachdev, PS; Brodaty, H; Sowmya, A"

Atrophy asymmetry in hippocampal subfields in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,"Volumetric analysis of hippocampal subfields and their asymmetry assessment recently has been useful biomarkers in neuroscience. In this study, hippocampal subfields atrophy and pattern of their asymmetry in the patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were evaluated. MRI images of 20 AD patients, 20 MCI patients, and 20 healthy control (HC) were selected. The volumes of hippocampal subfields were extracted automatically using Freesurfer toolkit. The subfields asymmetry index (AI) and laterality ([Formula: see text]) were also evaluated. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the subfields volume between three patient groups (age and gender as covariates). We used ANOVA (P < 0.05) test for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni's post hoc correction method. Hippocampal subfields volume in AD patients were significantly lower than HC and MCI groups (P < 0.02); however, no significant difference was observed between MCI and HC groups. The asymmetry index (AI) in some subfields was significantly different between AD and MCI, as well as between AD and HC, while there was not any significant difference between MCI groups with HC. In all three patient groups, rightward laterality ([Formula: see text]) was seen in several subfields except subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum, while in AD patient, rightward lateralization slightly decrease. Hippocampal subfields asymmetry can be used as a quantitative biomarker in neurocognitive disorders. In this study, it was observed that the asymmetry index of some subfields in AD is significantly different from MCI. In AD, patient rightward laterality was less MCI an HC group.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Brain asymmetry; Brain atrophy; Brain laterality; Hippocampal subfields; Hippocampus; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuroimaging,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Atrophy,"Jahanshahi, AR; Naghdi Sadeh, R; Khezerloo, D"
Application of machine learning techniques for dementia severity prediction from psychometric tests in the elderly population.,"Previous research has shown the benefits of early detection and treatment of dementia. This detection is usually performed manually by one or more clinicians based on reports and psychometric testing. Machine learning algorithms provide an alternative method of prediction that may contribute, with an automated process and insights, to the diagnosis and classification of the severity level of dementia. The aim of this study is to explore the use of neuropsychological data from a reduced version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) to predict absence or different levels of dementia severity using the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) scores through the implementation of the kNN machine learning algorithm. A sample of 1164 elderly people over sixty years old were evaluated using a reduced version of the ACE-III and the GDS. The kNN classifier provided good accuracies using 15 items from the ACE-III and adequately differentiating people with absence and mild impairment, from those with more severe levels of impairment according to the GDS rating. Our results suggest that the kNN algorithm may be used to automate aspects of clinical cognitive impairment classification in the elderly population.",2023,Dementia; cognitive impairment; diagnosis; machine learning; psychometry,,"Calderón, C; Bekios-Calfa, J; Bekios-Canales, N; Véliz-García, O; Beyle, C; Palominos, D; Ávalos-Tejeda, M; Domic-Siede, M"
Psychosocial factors and hippocampal subfields: The Medea-7T study.,"Specific subfields within the hippocampus have shown vulnerability to chronic stress, highlighting the importance of looking regionally within the hippocampus to understand the role of psychosocial factors in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. A systematic review on psychosocial factors and hippocampal subfield volumes was performed and showed inconsistent results, highlighting the need for future studies to explore this relationship. The current study aimed to explore the association of psychosocial factors with hippocampal (subfield) volumes, using high-field 7T MRI. Data were from the Memory Depression and Aging (Medea)-7T study, which included 333 participants without dementia. Hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented from T2-weighted images using ASHS software. Generalized linear models accounting for correlated outcomes were used to assess the association between subfields (i.e., entorhinal cortex, subiculum, Cornu Ammonis [CA]1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus, and tail) and each psychosocial factor (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, childhood maltreatment, recent stressful life events, and social support), adjusted for age, sex, and intracranial volume. Neither depression nor anxiety was associated with specific hippocampal (subfield) volumes. A trend for lower total hippocampal volume was found in those reporting childhood maltreatment, and a trend for higher total hippocampal volume was found in those who experienced a recent stressful life event. Among subfields, low social support was associated with lower volume in the CA3 (B = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.72; -0.15). This study suggests possible differential effects among hippocampal (subfield) volumes and psychosocial factors.",2023,MRI; anxiety; depression; early life adversity; hippocampus; psychosocial,"Humans; Organ Size; Hippocampus; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; Aging; Entorhinal Cortex; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Twait, EL; Blom, K; Koek, HL; Zwartbol, MHT; Ghaznawi, R; Hendrikse, J; Gerritsen, L; Geerlings, MI"

Baseline structural imaging correlates of treatment outcomes in semantic variant primary progressive aphasia.,"Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of semantic knowledge in the context of anterior temporal lobe atrophy (left > right). Core features of svPPA include anomia and single-word comprehension impairment. Despite growing evidence supporting treatment for anomia in svPPA, there is a paucity of research investigating neural mechanisms supporting treatment-induced gains and generalization to untrained items. In the current study, we examined the relation between the structural integrity of brain parenchyma (tissue inclusive of gray and white matter) at pre-treatment and treatment outcomes for trained and untrained items in a group of 19 individuals with svPPA who completed lexical retrieval treatment. Two structural neuroimaging approaches were used: an exploratory, whole-brain, voxel-wise approach and an a priori region of interest (ROI) approach. Based on previous research, bilateral temporal (inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri), parietal (supramarginal and angular gyri), frontal (inferior and middle frontal gyri) and medial temporal (hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri) ROIs were selected from the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Analyses revealed improved naming of trained items and generalization to untrained items following treatment, providing converging evidence that individuals with svPPA can benefit from treatment for anomia. Better post-treatment naming accuracy was associated with the structural integrity of inferior parietal cortex and the hippocampus. Specifically, improved naming of trained items was related to the left supramarginal (phonological processing) and angular gyri (phonological and semantic processing), and improved naming of trained and untrained items was related to the left hippocampus (episodic, context-based memory). Future research should examine treatment outcomes in relation to pre-treatment functional and structural connectivity as well as changes in network dynamics following speech-language intervention to further elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying treatment response in svPPA and related disorders.",2023,Anomia; Lexical retrieval treatment; Magnetic resonance imaging; Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia; Treatment outcomes,"Humans; Semantics; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Anomia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Treatment Outcome","Dial, HR; Europa, E; Grasso, SM; Mandelli, ML; Schaffer, KM; Hubbard, HI; Wauters, LD; Wineholt, L; Wilson, SM; Gorno-Tempini, ML; Henry, ML"
Deep Learning for Brain MRI Confirms Patterned Pathological Progression in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Deep learning (DL) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has shown excellent performance in differentiating individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the value of DL in detecting progressive structural MRI (sMRI) abnormalities linked to AD pathology has yet to be established. In this study, an interpretable DL algorithm named the Ensemble of 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (Ensemble 3DCNN) with enhanced parsing techniques is proposed to investigate the longitudinal trajectories of whole-brain sMRI changes denoting AD onset and progression. A set of 2369 T1-weighted images from the multi-centre Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies cohorts are applied to model derivation, validation, testing, and pattern analysis. An Ensemble-3DCNN-based P-score is generated, based on which multiple brain regions, including amygdala, insular, parahippocampal, and temporal gyrus, exhibit early and connected progressive neurodegeneration. Complex individual variability in the sMRI is also observed. This study combining non-invasive sMRI and interpretable DL in detecting patterned sMRI changes confirmed AD pathological progression, shedding new light on predicting AD progression using whole-brain sMRI.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; deep learning; longitudinal trajectories of neurodegeneration; structural magnetic resonance imaging,Humans; Deep Learning; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain,"Pan, D; Zeng, A; Yang, B; Lai, G; Hu, B; Song, X; Jiang, T"
Classification of mild cognitive impairment based on handwriting dynamics and qEEG.,"Subtle changes in fine motor control and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are important in screening for early dementia in primary care populations. In this study, an automated, non-invasive and rapid detection protocol for mild cognitive impairment based on handwriting kinetics and quantitative EEG analysis was proposed, and a classification model based on a dual fusion of feature and decision layers was designed for clinical decision-marking. Seventy-nine volunteers (39 healthy elderly controls and 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment) were recruited for this study, and the handwritten data and the EEG signals were performed using a tablet and MUSE under four designed handwriting tasks. Sixty-eight features were extracted from the EEG and handwriting parameters of each test. Features selected from both models were fused using a late feature fusion strategy with a weighted voting strategy for decision making, and classification accuracy was compared using three different classifiers under handwritten features, EEG features and fused features respectively. The results show that the dual fusion model can further improve the classification accuracy, with the highest classification accuracy for the combined features and the best classification result of 96.3% using SVM with RBF kernel as the base classifier. In addition, this not only supports the greater significance of multimodal data for differentiating MCI, but also tests the feasibility of using the portable EEG headband as a measure of EEG in patients with cognitive impairment.",2023,Classification; Electroencephalography; Ensemble learning; Handwriting analysis; Mild cognitive impairment; Quantitative; Wearable sensors,Humans; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Electroencephalography; Handwriting; Alzheimer Disease,"Chai, J; Wu, R; Li, A; Xue, C; Qiang, Y; Zhao, J; Zhao, Q; Yang, Q"

Acoustic-Linguistic Features for Modeling Neurological Task Score in Alzheimer's.,"The average life expectancy is increasing globally due to advancements in medical technology, preventive health care, and a growing emphasis on gerontological health. Therefore, developing technologies that detect and track aging-associated disease in cognitive function among older adult populations is imperative. In particular, research related to automatic detection and evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical given the disease's prevalence and the cost of current methods. As AD impacts the acoustics of speech and vocabulary, natural language processing and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. We compare and contrast the performance of ten linear regression models for predicting Mini-Mental Status Exam scores on the ADReSS challenge dataset. We extracted 13000+ handcrafted and learned features that capture linguistic and acoustic phenomena. Using a subset of 54 top features selected by two methods: (1) recursive elimination and (2) correlation scores, we outperform a state-of-the-art baseline for the same task. Upon scoring and evaluating the statistical significance of each of the selected subset of features for each model, we find that, for the given task, handcrafted linguistic features are more significant than acoustic and learned features.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Computational Biology; Speech; Linguistics; Acoustics,"Aryal, SK; Prioleau, H; Burge, L"

Personal Precise Force Field for Intrinsically Disordered and Ordered Proteins Based on Deep Learning.,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are proteins without a fixed three-dimensional (3D) structure under physiological conditions and are associated with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidosis, diabetes, and other diseases. Experimental methods can hardly capture the ensemble of diverse conformations for IDPs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can sample continuous conformations that might provide a valuable complement to experimental data. However, the accuracy of MD simulations depends on the quality of force field. In particular, the evolutionary conservation and coevolution of IDPs introduce that current force fields could not precisely reproduce the conformation of IDPs. In order to improve the performance of force field, deep learning and reweighting methods were used to automatically generate personal force field parameters for intrinsically disordered and ordered proteins. At first, the deep learning method predicted more accuracy φ/ψ dihedral of residue than the previous method. Then, reweighting optimized the personal force field parameters for each residue. Finally, typical representative systems such as IDPs, structure protein, and fast-folding protein were used to evaluate this force field. The results indicate that two personal force field parameters (named PPFF1 and PPFF1_af2) could better reproduce the experimental observables than ff03CMAP force field. In summary, this strategy will provide feasibility for the development of precise personal force fields.",2023,,Humans; Deep Learning; Protein Folding; Intrinsically Disordered Proteins; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Alzheimer Disease; Protein Conformation,"Ji, X; Liu, H; Zhang, Y; Chen, J; Chen, HF"
Real-time automated detection of older adults' hand gestures in home and clinical settings.,"There is an urgent need, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, for methods that allow clinicians and neuroscientists to remotely evaluate hand movements. This would help detect and monitor degenerative brain disorders that are particularly prevalent in older adults. With the wide accessibility of computer cameras, a vision-based real-time hand gesture detection method would facilitate online assessments in home and clinical settings. However, motion blur is one of the most challenging problems in the fast-moving hands data collection. The objective of this study was to develop a computer vision-based method that accurately detects older adults' hand gestures using video data collected in real-life settings. We invited adults over 50 years old to complete validated hand movement tests (fast finger tapping and hand opening-closing) at home or in clinic. Data were collected without researcher supervision via a website programme using standard laptop and desktop cameras. We processed and labelled images, split the data into training, validation and testing, respectively, and then analysed how well different network structures detected hand gestures. We recruited 1,900 adults (age range 50-90 years) as part of the TAS Test project and developed UTAS7k-a new dataset of 7071 hand gesture images, split 4:1 into clear: motion-blurred images. Our new network, RGRNet, achieved 0.782 mean average precision (mAP) on clear images, outperforming the state-of-the-art network structure (YOLOV5-P6, mAP 0.776), and mAP 0.771 on blurred images.

Discriminative patterns of white matter changes in Alzheimer's.,"Changes in structural connectivity of the Alzheimer's brain have not been widely studied utilizing cutting-edge methodologies. This study develops an efficient structural connectome-based convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the AD and uses explanations of CNNs' choices in classification to pinpoint the discriminative changes in white matter connectivity in AD. A CNN architecture has been developed to classify normal control (NC) and AD subjects from the weighted structural connectome. Then, the CNN classification decision is visually analyzed using gradient-based localization techniques to identify the discriminative changes in white matter connectivity in Alzheimer's. The cortical regions involved in the identified discriminative structural connectivity changes in AD are highly covered in the temporal/subcortical regions. A specific pattern is identified in the discriminative changes in structural connectivity of AD, where the white matter changes are revealed within the temporal/subcortical regions and from the temporal/subcortical regions to the frontal and parietal regions in both left and right hemispheres.  The proposed approach has the potential to comprehensively analyze the discriminative structural connectivity differences in AD, change the way of detecting biomarkers, and help clinicians better understand the structural changes in AD and provide them with more confidence in automated diagnostic systems.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; CNN; Class activation map; Structural brain network; White matter connectivity,Humans; White Matter; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Connectome; Biomarkers,"Srivishagan, S; Kumaralingam, L; Thanikasalam, K; Pinidiyaarachchi, UAJ; Ratnarajah, N"

How far is the goal of applying β-amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with standardization of measurements?,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid (Aβ) is important for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the cohort distributions and cut-off values have large variation across different analytical assays, kits, and laboratories. In this review, we summarize the cut-off values and diagnostic performance for CSF Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, and explore the important effect factors. Based on the Alzheimer's Association external quality control program (AAQC program), the peer group coefficient of variation of manual ELISA assays for CSF Aβ1-42 was unsatisfied (>20%). Fully automated platforms with better performance have recently been developed, but still not widely applied. In 2020, the certified reference material (CRM) for CSF Aβ1-42 was launched; however, the AAQC 2021-round results did not show effective improvements. Thus, further development and popularization of CRM for CSF Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 are urgently required. Standardizing the diagnostic procedures of AD and related status and the pre-analytical protocols of CSF samples, improving detection performance of analytical assays, and popularizing the application of fully automated platforms are also important for the establishment of uniform cut-off values. Moreover, each laboratory should verify the applicability of uniform cut-off values, and evaluate whether it is necessary to establish its own population- and assay-specific cut-off values.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Cut-off value; β-amyloid,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments; Reference Standards; tau Proteins,"Zou, Y; Yu, S; Ma, X; Ma, C; Mao, C; Mu, D; Li, L; Gao, J; Qiu, L"

Also, the spatial heterogeneity of the brain alterations caused by neurodegenerative processes is not usually considered, despite the spatial configuration of the neuronal loss is a characteristic hallmark for each disorder. In this article, we propose a classification technique that incorporates uncertainty and spatial information for distinguishing between healthy subjects and patients from four distinct neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. We introduce a spatially informed Bayesian neural network (SBNN) that combines a three-dimensional neural network to extract neurodegeneration features from MRI, Bayesian inference to account for uncertainty in diagnosis, and a spatially informed MRI image using hidden Markov random fields to encode cerebral spatial information. The SBNN model demonstrates that classification accuracy increases up to 25% by including a spatially informed MRI scan. Furthermore, the SBNN provides a robust probabilistic diagnosis that resembles clinical decision-making and can account for the heterogeneous medical presentations of neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,Bayesian inference; classification; deep learning; magnetic resonance imaging; neurodegenerative diseases; spatial information,"Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Bayes Theorem; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease","Payares-Garcia, D; Mateu, J; Schick, W"

Staging Paro: The care of making robot(s) care.,"Paro, a baby seal robot, is arguably the best-known care robot worldwide. Its clinical effects on people with special needs have been studied for more than twenty years by multidisciplinary teams. However, there are very few studies of Paro 'in the wild', inserted in the routines and pressures of a care home, which is supposed to be Paro's natural environment. Based on fieldwork in a French public nursing home, this article relocates Paro's psychosocial effects - asserted by its corporate and academic advocates to stem from the robot's software and user-friendly design - in the situated practice of care deployed by the nursing staff. Although it is commonly assumed that the robot can interact autonomously, thanks to its AI, it took considerable efforts to enable 'patient-robot' interactions, and interactions were always mediated by care staff. The supervision of the interaction between Paro and its user(s) by at least one care worker, prescribed by its sales representative to prevent the seal robot from being harmed or monopolized by a resident, thus framed the very course and meaning of the interaction, through an entanglement of verbal and tactile guidance. Staging Paro often meant awakening and maintaining interest from confused or passive users, and playing with its ontological flexibility to meet the preferences of its elderly interlocutors.",2023,HRI; Paro; care work; ethnography; nursing home; ontological flexibility,Humans; Aged; Dementia; Robotics; Nursing Homes,"Chevallier, M"
Hypergraph Structural Information Aggregation Generative Adversarial Networks for Diagnosis and Pathogenetic Factors Identification of Alzheimer's Disease With Imaging Genetic Data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with profound pathogenetic causes. Imaging genetic data analysis can provide comprehensive insights into its causes. To fully utilize the multi-level information in the data, this article proposes a hypergraph structural information aggregation model, and constructs a novel deep learning method named hypergraph structural information aggregation generative adversarial networks (HSIA-GANs) for the automatic sample classification and accurate feature extraction. Specifically, HSIA-GAN is composed of generator and discriminator. The generator has three main functions. First, vertex graph and edge graph are constructed based on the input hypergraph to present the low-order relations. Second, the low-order structural information of hypergraph is extracted by the designed vertex convolution layers and edge convolution layers. Finally, the synthetic hypergraph is generated as the input of the discriminator. The discriminator can extract the high-order structural information directly from hypergraph through vertex-edge convolution, fuse the high and low-order structural information, and finalize the results through the full connection (FC) layers. Based on the data acquired from AD neuroimaging initiative, HSIA-GAN shows significant advantages in three classification tasks, and extracts discriminant features conducive to better disease classification.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Deep Learning; Algorithms; Neuroimaging","Bi, XA; Wang, Y; Luo, S; Chen, K; Xing, Z; Xu, L"
"Functional magnetic resonance imaging, deep learning, and Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently diagnosed using a mixture of psychological tests and clinical observations. However, these diagnoses are not perfect, and additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help improve our understanding of AD as well as our ability to detect the disease. Accordingly, a large amount of research has been invested into innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a form of neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose AD; however, fMRI is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. Nonetheless, recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human neural networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI research, deep learning models can automatically denoise images and classify AD by detecting patterns in participants' brain scans. In this systematic review, we investigate how fMRI (specifically resting-state fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose AD. In turn, we outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the accuracy, strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep learning methods. In turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new researchers, suggest specific areas for future research, and highlight the potential of fMRI to aid AD diagnoses.",2023,Alzheimer's disease (AD); computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD); deep learning; deep neural networks (DNN); functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Deep Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain,"Warren, SL; Moustafa, AA"

Effects of Motor Learning Interventions on Walking Performance and Physical Function in Older Adults With Cognitive Impairment and Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Older adults with cognitive impairment have deficits in executive systems that affect their gait automaticity. The aim of the meta-analysis and systematic review was to examine the effects of interventions focus on only motor learning principles on gait performance and physical functions (e.g., dynamic balance). After inspections of 879 articles, 11 relevant studies were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis. The PEDro scale and Modified Downs and Black checklist were used to assess the quality of studies, and a random-effect model was used at a 95% confidence interval for calculating pooled effect sizes. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that motor learning interventions increased gait speed, cadence, stride length, and reduced gait cognitive cost but did not affect gait variability and physical function. In conclusion, practitioners should pay attention more to the potential benefits of motor learning interventions in rehabilitating older adults with cognitive impairment.",2023,executive system function; gait training; synthesis review,Humans; Aged; Walking; Cognitive Dysfunction; Gait; Dementia,"Shafizadeh, M; Farina, N; Parvonpour, S"

Referential noun phrases distribute differently in Turkish speakers with schizophrenia.,"In all human languages, noun phrases (NPs) (e.g., 'a field', 'the woman with a book') are used to identify entities in discourse. Previous evidence has shown that the spontaneous speech of patients with schizophrenia (Sz) shows differences in the distribution of grammatically different types of NPs, which are in part specific to patients with formal thought disorder (FTD). Here we sought to provide the first evidence of related grammatical effects in a non-Indo-European language. Results from a picture description task in a sample of 16 Turkish speakers with FTD (+FTD), 15 without FTD (-FTD), and 27 controls revealed that relative to controls, people with Sz over-produced NPs that are 'bare' (in the sense of lacking any grammatical items such as the or a in English). The +FTD group generally showed stronger effects than -FTD, and used more pronouns and less NPs co-referring with previously mentioned NPs. In addition, the dynamic distribution of NP types over narrative time showed an effect of increased mean distance between definite NPs in -FTD relative to controls. In +FTD but no other group there was an unexpected random distribution of indefinite DPs. Incidence rates of referential anomalies increased from controls to the -FTD and +FTD groups. These findings further confirm that Sz is manifest through specific linguistic effects in the referential structure of meaning as mediated by grammar. They provide a linguistic baseline for neurocognitive models of FTD and help to define appropriate targets for the automatic extraction of linguistic features to classify psychotic speech.",2023,Formal thought disorder; Language in psychosis; Noun phrases; Reference; Turkish,Female; Humans; Schizophrenia; Frontotemporal Dementia; Language; Speech; Linguistics,"Çokal, D; Palominos-Flores, C; Yalınçetin, B; Türe-Abacı, Ö; Bora, E; Hinzen, W"
