Twitter Discussions on #digitaldementia: Content and Sentiment Analysis.,"Digital dementia is a term that describes a possible decline in cognitive abilities, especially memory, attributed to the excessive use of digital technology such as smartphones, computers, and tablets. This concept has gained popularity in public discourse and media lately. With the increasing use of social media platforms such as Twitter (subsequently rebranded as X), discussions about digital dementia have become more widespread, which offer a rich source of information to understand public perceptions, concerns, and sentiments regarding this phenomenon.",2024,Twitter; dementia; digital dementia; mobile phone; public health; social media,Social Media; Humans; Dementia; Retrospective Studies; Emotions,"Cho, H; Kim, KM; Kim, JY; Youn, BY"
"Deep learning of Parkinson's movement from video, without human-defined measures.","The core clinical sign of Parkinson's disease (PD) is bradykinesia, for which a standard test is finger tapping: the clinician observes a person repetitively tap finger and thumb together. That requires an expert eye, a scarce resource, and even experts show variability and inaccuracy. Existing applications of technology to finger tapping reduce the tapping signal to one-dimensional measures, with researcher-defined features derived from those measures.",2024,Artificial intelligence; Bradykinesia; Computer vision; Deep learning; Parkinson's disease; Video,,"Yang, J; Williams, S; Hogg, DC; Alty, JE; Relton, SD"
Heart rate variability modulates memory function in a virtual task.,"Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered one of the most relevant indicators of physical well-being and relevant biomarker for preventing cardiovascular risks. More recently, a growing amount of research has tracked an association between HRV and cognitive functions (i.e., attention). Research is still scarce on spatial orientation, a basic capability in our daily lives. It is also an important indicator of memory performance, and its malfunctioning working as an early sign of dementia. In this study, a total of 43 female students (M Age = 18.76; SD = 2.02) were measured in their lnRMSSD using the photoplethysmography technique with the Welltory smartphone app. They were also tested in their spatial memory with The Boxes Room, a virtual navigation test. Measures of physical activity were obtained with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Correlation analyses and repeated measures ANOVA were performed, comparing participants with high / low lnRMSSD in their spatial performance. Results showed that, at an equal level of physical activity, participants with a higher lnRMSSD were more effective in the early trials of The Boxes Room, being more precise in estimating the correct position of the stimuli. Moreover, a subsequent simple linear regression showed that a higher lnRMSSD was related to a smaller number of errors at the beginning of the spatial task. Overly, these results outline the relationship between HRV and navigation performance in early stages of processing, where the environment is still unknown and the situation is more demanding.",2024,Cardiology; Hippocampus; Navigation; Physical activity; Spatial orientation,Humans; Female; Heart Rate; Young Adult; Adolescent; Virtual Reality; Photoplethysmography; Spatial Memory; Spatial Navigation; Exercise; Memory,"Castillo-Escamilla, J; Ruffo, I; Carrasco-Poyatos, M; Granero-Gallegos, A; Cimadevilla, JM"
Examining Associations Between Smartphone Use and Clinical Severity in Frontotemporal Dementia: Proof-of-Concept Study.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a leading cause of dementia in individuals aged <65 years. Several challenges to conducting in-person evaluations in FTLD illustrate an urgent need to develop remote, accessible, and low-burden assessment techniques.

Value-based motivational strategies combined with technology to encourage a lifestyle that helps to prevent dementia.,"Lifestyles aimed at reducing dementia risk typically combine physical and cognitive training, nutritional adaptations, and, potentially, an augmentation in social interactions. Interventions at the population level are essential but should be complemented by individual efforts. For efficacy, lasting changes to an individual's lifestyle are needed, necessitating robust motivation and volition. Acting in accordance with one's values is assumed to be rewarding, leading to improved motivation and volition, and produces stable behaviour-outcome relationships. To this end, future preventive endeavours might first evaluate an individual's extant lifestyle, preferences, and values, including considerations of age-related changes to ensure these values remain a motivational source. Digital technology can support lifestyle goals and be targeted to support an individual's values. A digital platform could implement situation-specific, sensing-based feedback to alert users to a target situation (eg, opportunity for exercise) coupled with (smartphone-based) feedback on the extent of accomplished behavioural change to support individually set goals and facilitate their adjustment depending on whether these goals are achieved. This use of the motivational impetus of values, coupled with interpersonal techniques, such as motivational interviewing and SMART goal setting, in combination with sensor technology and just-in-time adaptive interventions, is assumed to hold high potential for dementia prevention.",2024,,Humans; Dementia; Motivation; Life Style,"Klöppel, S; Brill, E; Frisoni, GB; Aarsland, D; Klusmann-Weißkopf, V"

Actual Clinical Practice Assessment: A Rapid and Easy-to-Use Tool for Evaluating Cognitive Decline Equivalent to Dementia.,"Background Screening tests reveal the early signs of cognitive decline, enabling better self-care and preparation for the future. We developed and evaluated the accuracy of a rapid (20 s) and easy-to-use tool called ONSEI, assessing the cognitive decline equivalent to dementia in actual clinical practice by correlating clinical diagnoses with the ONSEI classification. Methods In this retrospective observational study, data were collected from individuals who visited three neurosurgical clinics in neighboring prefectures of Tokyo, Japan. ONSEI analysis was performed using a smartphone or tablet. The tool adopts a machine-learning algorithm using the speaker's age, time-orientation task score, and acoustic features of spoken responses to that task. Significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated by Fisher's exact test. Results The overall classification accuracy of ONSEI was 98.1% (p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 97.3% (p<0.001) and 98.5% (p<0.001), respectively. The proportion of correct classifications was consistent across different age groups. Conclusion ONSEI showed high classification accuracy for dementia in cognitively normal individuals in actual clinical practice, regardless of the facility at which the tests were conducted or the age of the participants. Thus, ONSEI can be useful for dementia screening and self-care.",2024,automated classification; dementia; digital cognitive assessment; machine learning; speech features,,"Asano, T; Yasuda, A; Kinoshita, S; Nomoto, J; Kato, T; Suzuki, C; Suzuki, H; Kinoshita, T; Shigeta, M; Homma, A"

Automatic offline-capable smartphone paper-based microfluidic device for efficient biomarker detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment. Efficient and rapid detection plays a crucial role in mitigating and managing AD progression. Deep learning-assisted smartphone-based microfluidic paper analysis devices (μPADs) offer the advantages of low cost, good sensitivity, and rapid detection, providing a strategic pathway to address large-scale disease screening in resource-limited areas. However, existing smartphone-based detection platforms usually rely on large devices or cloud servers for data transfer and processing. Additionally, the implementation of automated colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassay (c-ELISA) on μPADs can further facilitate the realization of smartphone μPADs platforms for efficient disease detection.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassay (c-ELISA); Deep learning; Microfluidic paper analysis devices (μPADs); Offline; Smartphone,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Smartphone; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Paper; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Peptide Fragments; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Deep Learning; Automation; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques,"Duan, S; Cai, T; Liu, F; Li, Y; Yuan, H; Yuan, W; Huang, K; Hoettges, K; Chen, M; Lim, EG; Zhao, C; Song, P"

PROCare4Life lessons learned.,"PeRsOnalised Integrated CARE Solution for Elderly (PROCare4Life) was an EU-funded project that ran from January 2020 until June 2023, whose focus was to further develop and integrate previous ICT solutions developed by several previous EU-funded projects into a unique modular system able to support the autonomy and empowerment and to increase the Quality of Life (QoL) of elderly people living with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or similar dementia, having also tested the system for elderly people living with comorbidities. This article focuses on the methodology and results used to identify the internal lessons learned. PROCare4Life was developed using a codesign approach involving more than 2,000 participants whose input has been listened to and transformed into valuable changes of the system and also into lessons learned included in this case study report. Since the beginning of the implementation of PROCare4Life, there has been a commitment to make invisible knowledge visible through open discussion and including our lessons learned in each of our deliverables. In the last six months of implementation, qualitative research has been implemented by the PROCare4Life consortium to identify and select our most relevant challenges and recommendations for future projects and initiatives. PROCare4Life was highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is acknowledged in the lessons learned. However, the consortium has focused on the recommendations that could be more valuable for ordinary implementation of future projects and initiatives developing eHealth tools for elderly citizens living with conditions that might affect their cognitive or mobility capacities.",2023,dementia; eHealth; Integrated Care; Lessons Learned; Digital technologies; People centred codesign; Parkinson’s; Alzheimer’s,,"Gangas, P; Judica, E; Marin, M; Bouça-Machado, R; Ferreira, JJ; Louro, C; Brach, M; Linnane, D; Ahmed, M; Bentlage, E; Semerci, YC; Proença, JP; Alfonso, J"
Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD. Our new smartphone test, TapTalk, combines analysis of hand and speech-like movements to detect AD risk. This study aims to [1] determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately predict preclinical AD [2], determine usability, reliability, and validity of TapTalk in cognitively asymptomatic older adults and [3], prospectively validate TapTalk in older adults who have cognitive symptoms against cognitive tests and clinical diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Dementia; Diadochokinesis; Digital biomarker; Finger-tapping; Kinematics; Multimodal; TAS Test; TapTalk,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Alty, J; Goldberg, LR; Roccati, E; Lawler, K; Bai, Q; Huang, G; Bindoff, AD; Li, R; Wang, X; St George, RJ; Rudd, K; Bartlett, L; Collins, JM; Aiyede, M; Fernando, N; Bhagwat, A; Giffard, J; Salmon, K; McDonald, S; King, AE; Vickers, JC"

A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"

Ethical issues when using digital biomarkers and artificial intelligence for the early detection of dementia.,"Dementia poses a growing challenge for health services but remains stigmatized and under-recognized. Digital technologies to aid the earlier detection of dementia are approaching market. These include traditional cognitive screening tools presented on mobile devices, smartphone native applications, passive data collection from wearable, in-home and in-car sensors, as well as machine learning techniques applied to clinic and imaging data. It has been suggested that earlier detection and diagnosis may help patients plan for their future, achieve a better quality of life, and access clinical trials and possible future disease modifying treatments. In this review, we explore whether digital tools for the early detection of dementia can or should be deployed, by assessing them against the principles of ethical screening programs. We conclude that while the importance of dementia as a health problem is unquestionable, significant challenges remain. There is no available treatment which improves the prognosis of diagnosed disease. Progression from early-stage disease to dementia is neither given nor currently predictable. Available technologies are generally not both minimally invasive and highly accurate. Digital deployment risks exacerbating health inequalities due to biased training data and inequity in digital access. Finally, the acceptability of early dementia detection is not established, and resources would be needed to ensure follow-up and support for those flagged by any new system. We conclude that early dementia detection deployed at scale via digital technologies does not meet standards for a screening program and we offer recommendations for moving toward an ethical mode of implementation.

Early detection of diseases causing dementia using digital navigation and gait measures: A systematic review of evidence.,"Wearable digital technologies capable of measuring everyday behaviors could improve the early detection of dementia-causing diseases. We conducted two systematic reviews following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to establish the evidence base for measuring navigation and gait, two everyday behaviors affected early in AD and non-AD disorders and not adequately measured in current practice. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies on asymptomatic and early-stage symptomatic individuals at risk of dementia, with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale used to assess bias and evaluate methodological quality. Of 316 navigation and 2086 gait records identified, 27 and 83, respectively, were included in the final sample. We highlight several measures that may identify at-risk individuals, whose quantifiability with different devices mitigates the risk of future technological obsolescence. Beyond navigation and gait, this review also provides the framework for evaluating the evidence base for future digital measures of behaviors considered for early disease detection.",2024,ambulation; digital technology; gait; navigation; preclinical dementia; prodromal dementia; smartphones; virtual reality; wearables,"Humans; Gait; Early Diagnosis; Wearable Electronic Devices; Databases, Factual; Dementia","Čepukaitytė, G; Newton, C; Chan, D"

"Physical Exercise and Health, 6: Sedentary Time, Independent of Health-Related Physical Activity, as a Risk Factor for Dementia in Older Adults.","Sedentary behaviors are leisurely behaviors that occur during waking hours performed while lying down or seated; examples are relaxing, conversing, using a smartphone, watching television, traveling in private or public transport, and thinking or working at a desk. Sedentary behaviors are common in everyday life; the average person spends 9-10 h/d sedentary. Findings from meta-analyses show that higher levels of physical activity are associated with a reduced risk of dementia and that near-absence of moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Sedentariness is a clearly defined construct that is more than just low levels of physical activity. Sedentariness, therefore, merits independent study. In this context, a recent cohort study, conducted in elderly subjects (mean age, 67 years) who were followed for a mean of 6.7 years, found that sedentariness, independent of current levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity, was associated in a dose-dependent fashion with the risk of incident dementia; the finding held true when reverse causation was addressed through the exclusion of subjects who developed dementia within 4 years of follow-up. The adjusted 10-year risk of dementia rose from about 8% with sedentariness at 10 h/d to about 23% with sedentariness at 15 h/d; the difference is clinically meaningful. Limitations of studies in the field are that residual confounding cannot be excluded, and that no randomized controlled trials exist upon which guidance may be based. Nevertheless, it could be prudent to decrease sedentary behaviors if only because these have also been associated with other adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Additional subjects explained in this article include reverse causation and how it may be dealt with during research design and data analysis, individual participant data meta-analysis, and making sense of results that are reported in terms of ""per 1,000 person-years.""",2024,,Humans; Aged; Sedentary Behavior; Exercise; Risk Factors; Cohort Studies; Dementia,"Andrade, C"

Digital Therapeutics for Improving Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Drugs and Biological Products: Preclinical and Clinical Studies Supporting Development of Drug + Digital Combination Therapies for Chronic Diseases.,"Limitations of pharmaceutical drugs and biologics for chronic diseases (e.g., medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, or inadequate efficacy) can be mitigated by mobile medical apps, known as digital therapeutics (DTx). Authorization of adjunct DTx by the US Food and Drug Administration and draft guidelines on ""prescription drug use-related software"" illustrate opportunities to create drug + digital combination therapies, ultimately leading towards drug-device combination products (DTx has a status of medical devices).

Efficacy of smartphone application-based multi-domain cognitive training in older adults without dementia.,"As the population ages and the prevalence of dementia increases, there is a growing emphasis on the importance of cognitive training to prevent dementia. A smartphone application-based cognitive training software program, BeauBrain Trainer (BBT), has been developed to provide better access to cognitive training for older adults. Numerous studies have revealed the effectiveness of cognitive training using a cognitive assessment tool.

A systematic review and narrative analysis of digital speech biomarkers in Motor Neuron Disease.,"Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a progressive and largely fatal neurodegeneritve disorder with a lifetime risk of approximately 1 in 300. At diagnosis, up to 25% of people with MND (pwMND) exhibit bulbar dysfunction. Currently, pwMND are assessed using clinical examination and diagnostic tools including the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALS-FRS(R)), a clinician-administered questionnaire with a single item on speech intelligibility. Here we report on the use of digital technologies to assess speech features as a marker of disease diagnosis and progression in pwMND. Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline and EMBASE were systematically searched. 40 studies were evaluated including 3670 participants; 1878 with a diagnosis of MND. 24 studies used microphones, 5 used smartphones, 6 used apps, 2 used tape recorders and 1 used the Multi-Dimensional Voice Programme (MDVP) to record speech samples. Data extraction and analysis methods varied but included traditional statistical analysis, CSpeech, MATLAB and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Speech features assessed also varied and included jitter, shimmer, fundamental frequency, intelligible speaking rate, pause duration and syllable repetition. Findings from this systematic review indicate that digital speech biomarkers can distinguish pwMND from healthy controls and can help identify bulbar involvement in pwMND. Preliminary evidence suggests digitally assessed acoustic features can identify more nuanced changes in those affected by voice dysfunction. No one digital speech biomarker alone is consistently able to diagnose or prognosticate MND. Further longitudinal studies involving larger samples are required to validate the use of these technologies as diagnostic tools or prognostic biomarkers.",2023,,,"Bowden, M; Beswick, E; Tam, J; Perry, D; Smith, A; Newton, J; Chandran, S; Watts, O; Pal, S"
Digital phenotyping: An equal opportunity approach to reducing disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"A rapidly aging world population is fueling a concomitant increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Scientific inquiry, however, has largely focused on White populations in Australia, the European Union, and North America. As such, there is an incomplete understanding of AD in other populations. In this perspective, we describe research efforts and challenges of cohort studies from three regions of the world: Central America, East Africa, and East Asia. These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

Digital behavioural signatures reveal trans-diagnostic clusters of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients.,"The current neuropsychiatric nosological categories underlie pragmatic treatment choice, regulation and clinical research but does not encompass biological rationale. However, subgroups of patients suffering from schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease have more in common than the neuropsychiatric nature of their condition, such as the expression of social dysfunction. The PRISM project presents here initial quantitative biological insights allowing the first steps toward a novel trans-diagnostic classification of psychiatric and neurological symptomatology intended to reinvigorate drug discovery in this area. In this study, we applied spectral clustering on digital behavioural endpoints derived from passive smartphone monitoring data in a subgroup of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as age matched healthy controls, as part of the PRISM clinical study. This analysis provided an objective social functioning characterization with three differential clusters that transcended initial diagnostic classification and was shown to be linked to quantitative neurobiological parameters assessed. This emerging quantitative framework will both offer new ways to classify individuals in biologically homogenous clusters irrespective of their initial diagnosis, and also offer insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these clusters.",2024,Behaviour; Clustering analysis; Digital phenotyping; Neuro-imaging; Neurology; Psychiatry,Humans; Schizophrenia; Alzheimer Disease,"Kas, MJH; Jongs, N; Mennes, M; Penninx, BWJH; Arango, C; van der Wee, N; Winter-van Rossum, I; Ayuso-Mateos, JL; Bilderbeck, AC; l'Hostis, P; Beckmann, CF; Dawson, GR; Sommer, B; Marston, HM"

Vertical Graphene-Based Printed Electrochemical Biosensor for Simultaneous Detection of Four Alzheimer's Disease Blood Biomarkers.,"Early detection and timely intervention play a vital role in the effective management of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, the diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease based on a single blood biomarker is relatively low, and the combined use of multiple blood biomarkers can greatly improve diagnostic accuracy. Herein, we report a printed electrochemical biosensor based on vertical graphene (VG) modified with gold nanoparticles (VG@nanoAu) for the simultaneous detection of four Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers. The printed electrochemical electrode array was constructed by laser etching and inkjet printing. Then gold nanoparticles were modified onto the working electrode surface via electrodeposition to further improve the sensitivity of the sensor. In addition, the entire printed electrochemical sensing system incorporates an electrochemical micro-workstation and a smartphone. The customized electrochemical micro-workstation incorporates four electro-chemical control chips, enabling the sensor to simultaneously analyze four biomarkers. Consequently, the printed electrochemical sensing system exhibits excellent analytical performance due to the large surface area, biocompatibility, and good conductivity of VG@nanoAu. The detection limit of the sensing system for Aβ40, Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau181 was 0.072, 0.089, 0.071, and 0.051 pg/mL, respectively, which meets the detection requirements of Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers. The printed electrochemical sensing system also exhibits good specificity and stability. This work has great value and promising prospects for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using blood biomarkers.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; printed electrochemical biosensor; vertical graphene,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gold; Graphite; Metal Nanoparticles; Biomarkers,"Li, M; Zeng, Y; Huang, Z; Zhang, L; Liu, Y"
Racially fair pupillometry measurements for RGB smartphone cameras using the far red spectrum.,"Pupillometry is a measurement of pupil dilation commonly performed as part of neurological assessments. Prior work have demonstrated the potential for pupillometry in screening or diagnosing a number of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's Disease, Schizophrenia, and Traumatic Brain Injury. Unfortunately, the expense and inaccessibility of specialized pupilometers that image in the near infrared spectrum limit the measurement to high resource clinics or institutions. Ideally, this measurement could be available via ubiquitous devices like smartphones or tablets with integrated visible spectrum imaging systems. In the visible spectrum of RGB cameras, the melanin in the iris absorbs light such that it is difficult to distinguish the pupil aperature that appears black. In this paper, we propose a novel pupillometry technique to enable smartphone RGB cameras to effectively differentiate the pupil from the iris. The proposed system utilizes a 630 nm long-pass filter to image in the far red (630-700 nm) spectrum, where the melanin in the iris reflects light to appear brighter in constrast to the dark pupil. Using a convolutional neural network, the proposed system measures pupil diameter as it dynamically changes in a frame by frame video. Comparing across 4 different smartphone models, the pupil-iris contrast of N = 12 participants increases by an average of 451% with the proposed system. In a validation study of N = 11 participants comparing the relative pupil change in the proposed system to a Neuroptics PLR-3000 Pupillometer during a pupillary light response test, the prototype system acheived a mean absolute error of 2.4%.",2023,,Humans; Melanins; Smartphone; Iris; Pupil; Alzheimer Disease; Iris Plant,"Barry, C; Wang, E"

A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk: Design and methodology of a randomized clinical trial.,"Aging populations are at increased risk of sleep deficiencies (e.g., insomnia) that are associated with a variety of chronic health risks, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Insomnia medications carry additional risk, including increased drowsiness and falls, as well as polypharmacy risks. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), but access is limited. Telehealth is one way to increase access, particularly for older adults, but to date telehealth has been typically limited to simple videoconferencing portals. While these portals have been shown to be non-inferior to in-person treatment, it is plausible that telehealth could be significantly improved. This work describes a protocol designed to evaluate whether a clinician-patient dashboard inclusive of several user-friendly features (e.g., patterns of sleep data from ambulatory devices, guided relaxation resources, and reminders to complete in-home CBTi practice) could improve CBTi outcomes for middle- to older-aged adults (N = 100). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three telehealth interventions delivered through 6-weekly sessions: (1) CBTi augmented with a clinician-patient dashboard, smartphone application, and integrated smart devices; (2) standard CBTi (i.e., active comparator); or (3) sleep hygiene education (i.e., active control). All participants were assessed at screening, pre-study evaluation, baseline, throughout treatment, and at 1-week post-treatment. The primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index.

[Mobile everyday-life digital technologies for the prevention of Alzheimer's dementia: cognitive health and cognitive safety].,"It is generally accepted that the treatment of Alzheimer's disease should be flanked by preventive measures for risk reduction in order to maintain cognitive functions for as long as possible; however, the research and development of treatment concepts are both faced with challenges. The preventive risk reduction necessitates a high level of coordination of neurology and psychiatry with other disciplines. Also, patients must develop a high level of health competence and summon up self-motivation and adherence. This concept article deals with the question of how mobile everyday-life digital technologies can help to address these challenges. The core prerequisite is the interdisciplinary coordinated structuring of prevention with the focus on cognitive health and cognitive safety. Cognitive health relates to a reduction of risk factors associated with lifestyle. Cognitive safety concerns the avoidance of iatrogenic side effects on cognitive functions. Digital technologies that are relevant in this context are mobile apps based on smartphones or tablets for everyday-life and high-frequency recording of cognitive functions, apps that can coach the implementation of lifestyle changes as companion technologies, apps that can assist in the reduction of iatrogenic risks and those that can improve the health competence of patients and relatives. The state of development of such medical products is at different stages of progress. Therefore, this concept article does not provide a review of existing products but rather deals with the fundamental interplay of potential solutions in the prevention of Alzheimer dementia in the areas of cognitive health and cognitive safety.",2023,Health competence; Interdisciplinary medicine; Preventive measures; Risk reduction; Treatment concepts,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Digital Technology; Cognition; Smartphone; Mobile Applications,"Düzel, E; Thyrian, JR"

"The Feasibility of Using Smartphone Sensors to Track Insomnia, Depression, and Anxiety in Adults and Young Adults: Narrative Review.","Since the era of smartphones started in early 2007, they have steadily turned into an accepted part of our lives. Poor sleep is a health problem that needs to be closely monitored before it causes severe mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression. Sleep disorders (eg, acute insomnia) can also develop to chronic insomnia if not treated early. More specifically, mental health problems have been recognized to have casual links to anxiety, depression, heart disease, obesity, dementia, diabetes, and cancer. Several researchers have used mobile sensors to monitor sleep and to study changes in individual mood that may cause depression and anxiety.",2023,anxiety; cardiovascular disease; dementia; depression; diabetes; digital; health; heart disease; insomnia; intervention; mHealth; men; mental health; mortality; obesity; risk; sensor; sleep; sleep disorder; technology; young adult,Humans; Young Adult; Smartphone; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Depression; Feasibility Studies; Anxiety,"Alamoudi, D; Breeze, E; Crawley, E; Nabney, I"
Computer vision quantification of whole-body Parkinsonian bradykinesia using a large multi-site population.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder, with bradykinesia being one of its cardinal features. Objective quantification of bradykinesia using computer vision has the potential to standardise decision-making, for patient treatment and clinical trials, while facilitating remote assessment. We utilised a dataset of part-3 MDS-UPDRS motor assessments, collected at four independent clinical and one research sites on two continents, to build computer-vision-based models capable of inferring the correct severity rating robustly and consistently across all identifiable subgroups of patients. These results contrast with previous work limited by small sample sizes and small numbers of sites. Our bradykinesia estimation corresponded well with clinician ratings (interclass correlation 0.74). This agreement was consistent across four clinical sites. This result demonstrates how such technology can be successfully deployed into existing clinical workflows, with consumer-grade smartphone or tablet devices, adding minimal equipment cost and time.",2023,,,"Morinan, G; Dushin, Y; Sarapata, G; Rupprechter, S; Peng, Y; Girges, C; Salazar, M; Milabo, C; Sibley, K; Foltynie, T; Cociasu, I; Ricciardi, L; Baig, F; Morgante, F; Leyland, LA; Weil, RS; Gilron, R; O'Keeffe, J"
Actual Telemedicine Needs of Japanese Patients with Neurological Disorders in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Objective During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many social activities have moved online using applications for digital devices (e.g. computers, smartphones). We investigated the needs of telemedicine and trends in medical status and social care situations of Japanese patients with neurological disorders in order to estimate their affinity for an online telemedicine application. Methods We designed an original questionnaire for the present study that asked participants what problems they had with hospital visits, how the COVID-19 pandemic had affected their lives, and whether or not they would like to receive telemedicine. Patients The present study included volunteer caregivers, participants with Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, stroke, dementia, immune-mediated neurological disease (IMMD), spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), headache, myopathy, and other neurological diseases from Okayama University Hospital. Results A total of 29.6% of patients wanted to use telemedicine. Patients with headaches (60.0%) and epilepsy (38.1%) were more likely to want to use telemedicine than patients with PD (17.8%) or stroke (19.0%). Almost 90% of patients had access to a digital device, and there was no association between favoring telemedicine, ownership of a digital device, hospital visiting time, or waiting time at the hospital, although age was associated with motivation to telemedicine use (52.6 vs. 62.2 years old, p<0.001). Conclusion We can contribute to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and the medical economy by promoting telemedicine, especially for young patients with headaches or epilepsy.",2023,COVID-19; epilepsy; headache; neurological disorder; telemedicine,Humans; Middle Aged; COVID-19; Pandemics; East Asian People; Telemedicine; Parkinson Disease; Epilepsy; Headache; Stroke,"Sasaki, R; Yunoki, T; Nakano, Y; Fukui, Y; Takemoto, M; Morihara, R; Abe, K; Yamashita, T"
A Multiplexed Cas13-Based Assay with Point-of-Care Attributes for Simultaneous COVID-19 Diagnosis and Variant Surveillance.,"Point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid detection technologies are poised to aid gold-standard technologies in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, yet shortcomings in the capability to perform critically needed complex detection-such as multiplexed detection for viral variant surveillance-may limit their widespread adoption. Herein, we developed a robust multiplexed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based detection using LwaCas13a and PsmCas13b to simultaneously diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pinpoint the causative SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC)-including globally dominant VOCs Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)-all the while maintaining high levels of accuracy upon the detection of multiple SARS-CoV-2 gene targets. The platform has several attributes suitable for POC use: premixed, freeze-dried reagents for easy use and storage; convenient direct-to-eye or smartphone-based readouts; and a one-pot variant of the multiplexed detection. To reduce reliance on proprietary reagents and enable sustainable use of such a technology in low- and middle-income countries, we locally produced and formulated our own recombinase polymerase amplification reaction and demonstrated its equivalent efficiency to commercial counterparts. Our tool-CRISPR-based detection for simultaneous COVID-19 diagnosis and variant surveillance that can be locally manufactured-may enable sustainable use of CRISPR diagnostics technologies for COVID-19 and other diseases in POC settings.",2023,,Humans; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Pandemics; Point-of-Care Systems; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Gene Editing,"Patchsung, M; Homchan, A; Aphicho, K; Suraritdechachai, S; Wanitchanon, T; Pattama, A; Sappakhaw, K; Meesawat, P; Wongsatit, T; Athipanyasilp, A; Jantarug, K; Athipanyasilp, N; Buahom, J; Visanpattanasin, S; Niljianskul, N; Chaiyen, P; Tinikul, R; Wichukchinda, N; Mahasirimongkol, S; Sirijatuphat, R; Angkasekwinai, N; Crone, MA; Freemont, PS; Joung, J; Ladha, A; Abudayyeh, O; Gootenberg, J; Zhang, F; Chewapreecha, C; Chanarat, S; Horthongkham, N; Pakotiprapha, D; Uttamapinant, C"

Bridging gaps in the design and implementation of socially assistive technologies for dementia care: the role of occupational therapy.,"Dementia is a global health challenge, and people living with dementia (PLWD) are especially susceptible to reduced engagement in meaningful occupations, including social participation. In the past few decades, socially assistive technologies continue to be developed amidst a rapidly evolving technological landscape to support the social health of PLWD and their caregivers. Examples include social robots, virtual reality, smart home technology, and various digital technologies, such as mobile applications for tablets and smartphones. Despite an increasing body of research and interest in this field, several gaps relating to the design and implementation process of socially assistive technologies continue to undermine their relevance for PLWD in daily life. In this paper, some of these gaps are highlighted and the role of occupational therapy in the design and implementation of socially assistive technology is presented. In the design process, occupational therapists are uniquely skilled to advise and advocate for the tailoring and personalisation of technology to address the occupational needs of PLWD. In the implementation of socially assistive technologies, occupational therapists are skilled to educate, train, and conduct ongoing evaluations with PLWD and their caregivers, to incorporate socially assistive technologies into their routine and daily lives. We recommend that occupational therapists should continue to be acquainted with such technologies through continuous professional development and educational curricula. Moreover, we highlight the necessary collaboration between occupational therapists, technology developers, and researchers to enhance the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology, so that their relevance for PLWD and their caregivers can be maximised.Implications for rehabilitationDevelopers and designers of socially assistive technology should consider the disease trajectory of different types of dementia, as well as the different needs, abilities, preferences, occupations and routines of people living with dementia (PLWD) and/or their caregivers.Collaborations between technology developers, researchers, and occupational therapists should take place iteratively throughout the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology to maximise their relevance and applicability for people living with dementia and their caregivers.To continue enhancing the current role of occupational therapy in socially assistive technology provision, occupational therapists should keep up to date with socially assistive technology that are being developed to support the social health of PLWD.",2024,Occupational therapy; dementia; design; digital technology; emerging technologies; implementation; smart home technology; social robots; socially assistive technology; virtual reality,Humans; Dementia; Occupational Therapy; Caregivers; Occupational Therapists; Self-Help Devices,"Koh, WQ; Heins, P; Flynn, A; Mahmoudi Asl, A; Garcia, L; Malinowsky, C; Brorsson, A"
Assessing prospective and retrospective metacognitive accuracy following traumatic brain injury remotely across cognitive domains.,"The ability to monitor one's behaviour is frequently impaired following TBI, impacting on patients' rehabilitation. Inaccuracies in judgement or self-reflection of one's performance provides a useful marker of metacognition. However, metacognition is rarely measured during routine neuropsychology assessments and how it varies across cognitive domains is unclear. A cohort of participants consisting of 111 TBI patients [mean age = 45.32(14.15), female = 29] and 84 controls [mean age = 31.51(12.27), female = 43] was studied. Participants completed cognitive assessments via a bespoke digital platform on their smartphones. Included in the assessment were a prospective evaluation of memory and attention, and retrospective confidence judgements of task performance. Metacognitive accuracy was calculated from the difference between confidence judgement of task performance and actual performance. Prospective judgment of attention and memory was correlated with task performance in these domains for controls but not patients. TBI patients had lower task performance in processing speed, executive functioning and working memory compared to controls, maintaining high confidence, resulting in overestimation of cognitive performance compared to controls. Additional judgments of task performance complement neuropsychological assessments with little additional time-cost. These results have important theoretical and practical implications for evaluation of metacognitive impairment in TBI patients and neurorehabilitation.",2023,Traumatic brain injury; memory; metacognition; processing speed; remote cognitive assessment; self-awareness,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Metacognition; Retrospective Studies; Executive Function; Judgment; Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Bourke, NJ; Trender, W; Hampshire, A; Lai, H; Demarchi, C; David, M; Hellyer, P; Sharp, DJ; Friedland, D"
A Systematic Review of Navigation Assistance Systems for People With Dementia.,"Technological developments provide solutions to alleviate the tremendous impact on the health and autonomy due to the impact of dementia on navigation abilities. We systematically reviewed the literature on devices tested to provide assistance to people with dementia during indoor, outdoor and virtual navigation (PROSPERO ID number: 215585). Medline and Scopus databases were searched from inception. Our aim was to summarize the results from the literature to guide future developments. Twenty-three articles were included in our study. Three types of information were extracted from these studies. First, the types of navigation advice the devices provided were assessed through: (i) the sensorial modality of presentation, e.g., visual and tactile stimuli, (ii) the navigation content, e.g., landmarks, and (iii) the timing of presentation, e.g., systematically at intersections. Second, we analyzed the technology that the devices were based on, e.g., smartphone. Third, the experimental methodology used to assess the devices and the navigation outcome was evaluated. We report and discuss the results from the literature based on these three main characteristics. Finally, based on these considerations, recommendations are drawn, challenges are identified and potential solutions are suggested. Augmented reality-based devices, intelligent tutoring systems and social support should particularly further be explored.",2023,,"Humans; Computer Graphics; Augmented Reality; Databases, Factual; Smartphone; Dementia","Pillette, L; Moreau, G; Normand, JM; Perrier, M; Lecuyer, A; Cogne, M"
Improvement in executive function for older adults through smartphone apps: a randomized clinical trial comparing language learning and brain training.,"Bilingualism has been linked to improved executive function and delayed onset of dementia, but it is unknown whether similar benefits can be obtained later in life through deliberate intervention. Given the logistical hurdles of second language acquisition in a randomized trial for older adults, few interventional studies have been done thus far. However, recently developed smartphone apps offer a convenient means to acquire skills in a second language and can be compared with brain training apps specifically designed to improve executive function. In a randomized clinical trial, 76 adults aged 65-75 were assigned to either 16 weeks of Spanish learning using the app Duolingo 30 minutes a day, an equivalent amount of brain training using the app BrainHQ, or a waitlist control condition. Executive function was assessed before and after the intervention with preregistered (NCT03638882) tests previously linked to better performance in bilinguals. For two of the primary measures: incongruent Stroop color naming and 2-back accuracy, Duolingo provided equivalent benefits as BrainHQ compared to a control group. On reaction time for N-back and Simon tests, the BrainHQ group alone experienced strong gains over the other two groups. Duolingo was rated as more enjoyable. These results suggest that app-based language learning may provide some similar benefits as brain training in improving executive function in seniors but has less impact on processing speed. However, future advancements in app design may optimize not only the acquisition of the target language but also the side benefits of the language learning experience.",2023,Bilingualism; cognitive training; dementia; executive function; language learning,Humans; Aged; Executive Function; Mobile Applications; Cognitive Training; Language; Language Development,"Meltzer, JA; Kates Rose, M; Le, AY; Spencer, KA; Goldstein, L; Gubanova, A; Lai, AC; Yossofzai, M; Armstrong, SEM; Bialystok, E"
