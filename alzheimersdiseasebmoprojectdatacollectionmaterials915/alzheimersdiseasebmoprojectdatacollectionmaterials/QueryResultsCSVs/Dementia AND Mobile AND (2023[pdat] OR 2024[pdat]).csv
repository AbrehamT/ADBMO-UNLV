Providing and receiving support through a tailor-made mobile app: a qualitative study on experience of professionals and family caregivers to persons with dementia.,The ageing population and the rise of persons with dementia (PWD) living at home have increased the need for support by family caregivers (FC). Research suggests that most FCs are unprepared for the complex role of informal caregiving. The use of mobile applications (apps) provide a cost-effective and efficient opportunity for community-based social care professionals to provide tailor-made support to FCs. The literature indicates that there are limited mobile apps available to meet the needs of the FCs to PWD living at home. The aim of this study was to explore how social care professionals and FCs to PWD living at home experience providing and receiving support through a tailor-made mobile app named STAV.,2024,Dementia; Dementia care; Family caregiver; Mobile app; Social care professional; Support; eHealth; mHealth,"Humans; Mobile Applications; Caregivers; Male; Female; Dementia; Qualitative Research; Aged; Middle Aged; Social Support; Adult; Aged, 80 and over","Kagwa, AS; Dorell, Å; Konradsen, H; Vikström, S; Kabir, ZN"
Evaluating a mobile-based intervention to promote the mental health of informal dementia caregivers in Singapore: Study protocol for a pilot two-armed randomised controlled trial.,"Informal caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) often suffer adverse impacts on their mental health and require interventions for effective support.

Self-Testing for Dementia: A Phenomenological Analysis of Fear.,"Following the growing economic relevance of mobile health (mHealth) and the increasing global prevalence of dementia, self-testing apps for dementia and mild neurocognitive disorder (MCD) have been developed and advertised. The apps' promise of a quick and easy tool has been criticized in the literature from a variety of angles, but as we argue in this article, the celebratory characterization of self-testing also stands in disbalance to the various kinds of fears that may be connected to taking the test. By drawing on Sara Ahmed's phenomenological theory on emotions and by referring to illustrative experiences from two users with a particular dementia self-testing app, we explore four dimensions of fear derived from phenomenology: performative, ontological, embodied, and temporal dimensions. We argue that fear (1) motivates one to take the self-test and to try to take control over one's health; (2) is shaped by and shapes the ways in which we make sense of ourselves and others as cognitively deficient; (3) constructs and is constructed by our differently embodied presence in the world; and that (4) testing makes a fearful future self as cognitively deficient more tangible. In outlining these different dimensions of fear, this article expands the understanding of the meaning of experiencing self-testing in comparison to the mostly quantitative literature on this topic.",2024,Dementia; Fear; Mild neurocognitive disorder; Phenomenology; Self-testing apps; mHealth,,"Kapeller, A; de Boer, M"

Evaluation of the Parkinson's Remote Interactive Monitoring System in a Clinical Setting: Usability Study.,"The fastest-growing neurological disorder is Parkinson disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 10 million people worldwide. PD is typically treated with levodopa, an oral pill taken to increase dopamine levels, and other dopaminergic agonists. As the disease advances, the efficacy of the drug diminishes, necessitating adjustments in treatment dosage according to the patient's symptoms and disease progression. Therefore, remote monitoring systems that can provide more detailed and accurate information on a patient's condition regularly are a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to manage their medication. The Parkinson's Remote Interactive Monitoring System (PRIMS), developed by PragmaClin Research Inc, was designed on the premise that it will be an easy-to-use digital system that can accurately capture motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD remotely.",2024,Parkinson disease; System Usability Scale; mobile phone; motor examination; movement disorders; remote monitoring; thematic analysis; usability,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; User-Computer Interface; Monitoring, Physiologic","Bridges, B; Taylor, J; Weber, JT"
Spatial navigation questionnaires as a supportive diagnostic tool in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Impaired spatial navigation is early marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined ability of self- and informant-reported navigation questionnaires to discriminate between clinically and biomarker-defined participants, and associations of questionnaires with navigation performance, regional brain atrophy, AD biomarkers, and biomarker status. 262 participants (cognitively normal, with subjective cognitive decline, amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI], and mild dementia) and their informants completed three navigation questionnaires. Navigation performance, magnetic resonance imaging volume/thickness of AD-related brain regions, and AD biomarkers were measured. Informant-reported questionnaires distinguished between cognitively normal and impaired participants, and amyloid-β positive and negative aMCI. Lower scores were associated with worse navigation performance, greater atrophy in AD-related brain regions, and amyloid-β status. Self-reported questionnaire scores did not distinguish between the groups and were weakly associated with navigation performance. Other associations were not significant. Informant-reported navigation questionnaires may be a screening tool for early AD reflecting atrophy of AD-related brain regions and AD pathology.",2024,Clinical neuroscience; Disease; Neuroscience,,"Laczó, M; Svatkova, R; Lerch, O; Martinkovic, L; Zuntychova, T; Nedelska, Z; Horakova, H; Vyhnalek, M; Hort, J; Laczó, J"
LINE-1 retrotransposons contribute to mouse PV interneuron development.,"Retrotransposons are mobile DNA sequences duplicated via transcription and reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Cis-regulatory elements encoded by retrotransposons can also promote the transcription of adjacent genes. Somatic LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon insertions have been detected in mammalian neurons. It is, however, unclear whether L1 sequences are mobile in only some neuronal lineages or therein promote neurodevelopmental gene expression. Here we report programmed L1 activation by SOX6, a transcription factor critical for parvalbumin (PV) interneuron development. Mouse PV interneurons permit L1 mobilization in vitro and in vivo, harbor unmethylated L1 promoters and express full-length L1 mRNAs and proteins. Using nanopore long-read sequencing, we identify unmethylated L1s proximal to PV interneuron genes, including a novel L1 promoter-driven Caps2 transcript isoform that enhances neuron morphological complexity in vitro. These data highlight the contribution made by L1 cis-regulatory elements to PV interneuron development and transcriptome diversity, uncovered due to L1 mobility in this milieu.",2024,,"Animals; Interneurons; Mice; Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements; Parvalbumins; Retroelements; Male; Neurogenesis; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Bodea, GO; Botto, JM; Ferreiro, ME; Sanchez-Luque, FJ; de Los Rios Barreda, J; Rasmussen, J; Rahman, MA; Fenlon, LR; Jansz, N; Gubert, C; Gerdes, P; Bodea, LG; Ajjikuttira, P; Da Costa Guevara, DJ; Cumner, L; Bell, CC; Kozulin, P; Billon, V; Morell, S; Kempen, MHC; Love, CJ; Saha, K; Palmer, LM; Ewing, AD; Jhaveri, DJ; Richardson, SR; Hannan, AJ; Faulkner, GJ"

A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"

Alzheimer's disease progression detection based on optical fluence rate measurements using alternative laser wavelengths.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) levels have increased globally, which is considered the sixth reason for deaths. So, a requirement exists for economic and quantitative methods to follow up the gradual progression of AD. The current study presents a simulation for a non-irradiated, safe, wearable, and noninvasive mobile approach for detecting the progression of Alzheimer's brain atrophy using the optical diffusion technique and for investigating the difference between the normal and the diseased brain. The virtual study was accomplished using COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulated head is implemented as the following: scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and white matter. The optical properties of the heterogeneous tissue are observed using the fluence rate after irradiating the head with different wavelengths (630, 700, 810, 915, and 1000 nm) of lasers. Two assessment techniques were applied to evaluate the brain atrophy measurements; the first technique was an array of photodetectors, which were lined at the head posterior, while a matrix of photodetectors was applied over the head surface in the second technique. The results show that the surface photodetectors approach differentiates the normal from AD brains without measuring the brain atrophy percentages by applying 630 nm. The array of photodetectors distinguishes normal from AD brains without detecting the brain atrophy percentages when the wavelengths 630, 700, and 810 nm were applied. The line detector at 1000 nm evaluates the brain atrophy percentages with AD. The future explores applying those techniques in vivo and analyzing the information by the spectrometer for extensively safer early detection of neural disorders.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; diffuse optical imaging; optical fluence rate; optical properties,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Disease Progression; Lasers; Brain; Atrophy; Gray Matter,"Mahdy, S; Abuelmakarem, HS"

Luminal transport through intact endoplasmic reticulum limits the magnitude of localized Ca,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms an interconnected network of tubules stretching throughout the cell. Understanding how ER functionality relies on its structural organization is crucial for elucidating cellular vulnerability to ER perturbations, which have been implicated in several neuronal pathologies. One of the key functions of the ER is enabling Ca[Formula: see text] signaling by storing large quantities of this ion and releasing it into the cytoplasm in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. Through a combination of physical modeling and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that alterations in ER shape significantly impact its ability to support efficient local Ca[Formula: see text] releases, due to hindered transport of luminal content within the ER. Our model reveals that rapid Ca[Formula: see text] release necessitates mobile luminal buffer proteins with moderate binding strength, moving through a well-connected network of ER tubules. These findings provide insight into the functional advantages of normal ER architecture, emphasizing its importance as a kinetically efficient intracellular Ca[Formula: see text] delivery system.",2024,calcium signaling; endoplasmic reticulum; intracellular transport; mathematical modeling; organelles,Endoplasmic Reticulum; Signal Transduction; Neurons; Calcium; Calcium Signaling,"Crapart, CC; Scott, ZC; Konno, T; Sharma, A; Parutto, P; Bailey, DMD; Westrate, LM; Avezov, E; Koslover, EF"

Sex-specific factors associated with acceptance of smartwatches among urban older adults: the Itabashi longitudinal study on aging.,"Smartwatches (SW) are wearable devices that support daily life and monitor an individual's health and activity status. This information is utilized to promote behavior modification, which could help prevent chronic diseases and manage the health of older adults. Despite being interested in SWs, older adults tend to decrease their SW usage as they age. Therefore, understanding the acceptance of SWs among older individuals can facilitate individual health management through digital health technology. This study investigated the factors associated with the acceptance of SWs among older adults in Japan and the variations in the factors by sex. This study utilized data from the 2022 Itabashi Longitudinal Study on Aging, an ongoing cohort study conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology. We included 899 eligible individuals aged ≥65 years. Participants were classified into three groups: possessing SW (possessor group), not possessing SW but interested in possession in the future (interest group), and not interested in possession in the future (non-interest group) using a self-administered questionnaire. The level of SW acceptance was operationally defined as follows: low (non-interest group), medium (interest group), and high (possessor group). Further, we evaluated the association of acceptance and purchase intentions of SWs with sociodemographic variables, technology literacy, and health variables. Among the participants, 4.2% possessed SWs, with no significant sex difference (men, 4.2%; women, 4.3%). Among men, age < 75 years, obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were significantly associated with SW acceptance level. Contrastingly, among women, age < 75 years, living alone, higher household income, and a high score for new device use in the technology literacy category were significantly associated with SW acceptance level. Health-related factors were associated with SW acceptance in men, while technology literacy and sociodemographic factors were associated with SW acceptance in women. Our findings may inform the development of sex-specific interventions and policies for increasing SW utilization among older adults in Japan.",2024,health promotion; mobile health; smart wearables; technology innovativeness; wearable healthcare device,Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Cohort Studies; Aging; Geriatrics; Chronic Disease,"Deguchi, N; Osuka, Y; Kojima, N; Motokawa, K; Iwasaki, M; Inagaki, H; Miyamae, F; Okamura, T; Hirano, H; Awata, S; Sasai, H"

Modeling and mobile home monitoring of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).,"With the increasing global aging population, dementia care has rapidly become a major social problem. Current diagnosis of Behavior and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) relies on clinical interviews, and behavioral rating scales based on a period of behavior observation, but these methods are not suitable for identification of occurrence of BPSD in the daily living, which is necessary for providing appropriate interventions for dementia, though, has been studied by few research groups in the literature. To address these issues, in this study developed a BPSD monitoring system consisting of a Psycho-Cognitive (PsyCo) BPSD model, a Behavior-Physio-Environment (BePhyEn) BPSD model, and an implementation platform. The PsyCo BPSD model provides BPSD assessment support to caregivers and care providers, while the BePhyEn BPSD model provides instantaneous alerts for BPSD enabled by a 24-hour home monitoring platform for early intervention, and thereby alleviation of burden to patients and caregivers. Data for acquiring the models were generated through extensive literature review and regularity determined. A mobile robot was utilized as the implementation platform for improving sensitivity of sensors for home monitoring, and elderly individual following algorithms were investigated. Experiments in a virtual home environment showed that, a virtual BPSD elderly individual can be followed safely by the robot, and BPSD occurrence could be identified accurately, demonstrating the possibility of modeling and identification of BPSD in home environment.",2024,BPSD models; Home monitoring robots; Identification of occurrence of BPSD,Humans; Aged; Dementia; Caregivers; Behavioral Symptoms,"Yuan, H; Yang, T; Xie, Q; Lledos, G; Chou, WH; Yu, W"

Ethical issues when using digital biomarkers and artificial intelligence for the early detection of dementia.,"Dementia poses a growing challenge for health services but remains stigmatized and under-recognized. Digital technologies to aid the earlier detection of dementia are approaching market. These include traditional cognitive screening tools presented on mobile devices, smartphone native applications, passive data collection from wearable, in-home and in-car sensors, as well as machine learning techniques applied to clinic and imaging data. It has been suggested that earlier detection and diagnosis may help patients plan for their future, achieve a better quality of life, and access clinical trials and possible future disease modifying treatments. In this review, we explore whether digital tools for the early detection of dementia can or should be deployed, by assessing them against the principles of ethical screening programs. We conclude that while the importance of dementia as a health problem is unquestionable, significant challenges remain. There is no available treatment which improves the prognosis of diagnosed disease. Progression from early-stage disease to dementia is neither given nor currently predictable. Available technologies are generally not both minimally invasive and highly accurate. Digital deployment risks exacerbating health inequalities due to biased training data and inequity in digital access. Finally, the acceptability of early dementia detection is not established, and resources would be needed to ensure follow-up and support for those flagged by any new system. We conclude that early dementia detection deployed at scale via digital technologies does not meet standards for a screening program and we offer recommendations for moving toward an ethical mode of implementation.

Investigating the efficacy and importance of mobile-based assessments for Parkinson's disease: uncovering the potential of novel digital tests.,"This study introduces PDMotion, a mobile application comprising 11 digital tests, including those adapted from the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III and novel assessments, for remote Parkinson's Disease (PD) motor symptoms evaluation. Employing machine learning techniques on data from 50 PD patients and 29 healthy controls, PDMotion achieves accuracies of 0.878 for PD status prediction and 0.715 for severity assessment. A post-hoc explanation model is employed to assess the importance of features and tasks in diagnosis and severity evaluation. Notably, novel tasks that are not adapted from MDS-UPDRS Part III like the circle drawing, coordination test, and alternative tapping test are found to be highly important, suggesting digital assessments for PD can go beyond digitizing existing tests. The alternative tapping test emerges as the most significant task. Using its features alone achieves prediction accuracies comparable to the full task set, underscoring its potential as an independent screening tool. This study addresses a notable research gap by digitalizing a wide array of tests, including novel ones, and conducting a comparative analysis of their feature and task importance. These insights provide guidance for task selection and future development in PD mobile assessments, a field previously lacking such comparative studies.",2024,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Machine Learning; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Mobile Applications; Paracentesis,"Zhang, Y; Zeng, Z; Mirian, MS; Yen, K; Park, KW; Doo, M; Ji, J; Shen, Z; McKeown, MJ"
Performance of digital technologies in assessing fall risks among older adults with cognitive impairment: a systematic review.,"Older adults with cognitive impairment (CI) are twice as likely to fall compared to the general older adult population. Traditional fall risk assessments may not be suitable for older adults with CI due to their reliance on attention and recall. Hence, there is an interest in using objective technology-based fall risk assessment tools to assess falls within this population. This systematic review aims to evaluate the features and performance of technology-based fall risk assessment tools for older adults with CI. A systematic search was conducted across several databases such as PubMed and IEEE Xplore, resulting in the inclusion of 22 studies. Most studies focused on participants with dementia. The technologies included sensors, mobile applications, motion capture, and virtual reality. Fall risk assessments were conducted in the community, laboratory, and institutional settings; with studies incorporating continuous monitoring of older adults in everyday environments. Studies used a combination of technology-based inputs of gait parameters, socio-demographic indicators, and clinical assessments. However, many missed the opportunity to include cognitive performance inputs as predictors to fall risk. The findings of this review support the use of technology-based fall risk assessment tools for older adults with CI. Further advancements incorporating cognitive measures and additional longitudinal studies are needed to improve the effectiveness and clinical applications of these assessment tools. Additional work is also required to compare the performance of existing methods for fall risk assessment, technology-based fall risk assessments, and the combination of these approaches.",2024,Cognitive impairment; Digital technologies; Fall prediction; Falls risk assessment; Older adults,Humans; Aged; Digital Technology; Cognitive Dysfunction; Risk Assessment; Gait,"Koh, V; Xuan, LW; Zhe, TK; Singh, N; B Matchar, D; Chan, A"

The ASPREE Healthy Ageing Biobank: Methodology and participant characteristics.,"ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE), a placebo-controlled prevention trial of low dose aspirin, provided the opportunity to establish a biospecimen biobank from initially healthy persons aged 70+ years for future research. The ASPREE Healthy Ageing Biobank (ASPREE Biobank) collected, processed and stored blood and urine samples at -80degC or under nitrogen vapour at two timepoints, three years apart, from a willing subset of Australian ASPREE participants. Written informed consent included separate opt-in questions for biomarker and genetic testing. Fractionated blood and urine were aliquoted into multiple low-volume, barcoded cryotubes for frozen storage within 4 hours of collection. Specially designed and outfitted mobile laboratories provided opportunities for participation by people in regional and rural areas. Detailed, high quality demographic, physiological and clinical data were collected annually through the ASPREE trial. 12,219 participants contributed blood/urine at the first timepoint, 10,617 of these older adults provided 3-year follow-up samples, and an additional 1,712 provided saliva for DNA. The mean participant age was 74 years, 54% were female and 46% lived outside major cities. Despite geographical and logistical challenges, nearly 100% of blood/urine specimens were processed and frozen within 4 hours of collection into >1.4 million aliquots. After a median of 4.7 years, major clinical events among ASPREE Biobank participants included 332 with dementia, 613 with cardiovascular disease events, 1259 with cancer, 357 with major bleeds and 615 had died. The ASPREE Biobank houses and curates a large number of biospecimens collected prior to the clinical manifestations of major disease, and 3-year follow-up samples, all linked to high quality, extensive phenotypic information.

Transposable Elements: Emerging Therapeutic Targets in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal function and structure. While several genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders, emerging evidence suggests that transposable elements (TEs), once considered ""junk DNA,"" play a significant role in their development and progression. TEs are mobile genetic elements capable of moving within the genome, and their dysregulation has been associated with genomic instability, altered gene expression, and neuroinflammation. This review provides an overview of TEs, including long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), mechanisms of repression and derepression, and their potential impact on neurodegeneration. The evidence linking TEs to AD, PD, and ALS by shedding light on the complex interactions between TEs and neurodegeneration has been discussed. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of targeting TEs in neurodegenerative diseases has been explored. Understanding the role of TEs in neurodegeneration holds promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating disease progression and preserving neuronal health.",2024,Junk DNA; Neurodegenerative diseases; Therapeutic target; Transposable elements,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; DNA Transposable Elements; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease,"Singh, S; Borkar, MR; Bhatt, LK"
LIV Well when Life Is Limited: Technology to Support Independence at Home.,"There has been significant growth in technologies and services creating 'care at home' ecosystems for people with life-limiting conditions such as dementia. Dementia is one of the leading causes of disability and loss of independence that causes a heavy burden for families and caregivers. There is a clear need to support independent living of people living with dementia and their caregivers. Health technologies can help to foster supported living and social connection. The LIV app, developed by Miroma Project Factory and piloted in collaboration with CSIRO, was designed to achieve these aims. Here we describe the development and functionality of the app and present the preliminary findings from the pilot trial.",2024,Dementia; caregiver; independent living; mobile health technology,Humans; Ecosystem; Technology; Biomedical Technology; Independent Living; Dementia,"Kholghi, M; Silvera, D; Wong, G; Walker, J; Wilson, J; Bradford, D"

Digital Therapeutics for Improving Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Drugs and Biological Products: Preclinical and Clinical Studies Supporting Development of Drug + Digital Combination Therapies for Chronic Diseases.,"Limitations of pharmaceutical drugs and biologics for chronic diseases (e.g., medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, or inadequate efficacy) can be mitigated by mobile medical apps, known as digital therapeutics (DTx). Authorization of adjunct DTx by the US Food and Drug Administration and draft guidelines on ""prescription drug use-related software"" illustrate opportunities to create drug + digital combination therapies, ultimately leading towards drug-device combination products (DTx has a status of medical devices). Digital interventions (mobile, web-based, virtual reality, and video game applications) demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for people living with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. In the respective animal disease models, preclinical studies on environmental enrichment and other non-pharmacological modalities (physical activity, social interactions, learning, and music) as surrogates for DTx ""active ingredients"" also show improved outcomes. In this narrative review, we discuss how drug + digital combination therapies can impact translational research, drug discovery and development, generic drug repurposing, and gene therapies.

Shifting From Active to Passive Monitoring of Alzheimer Disease: The State of the Research.,"Most research using digital technologies builds on existing methods for staff-administered evaluation, requiring a large investment of time, effort, and resources. Widespread use of personal mobile devices provides opportunities for continuous health monitoring without active participant engagement. Home-based sensors show promise in evaluating behavioral features in near real time. Digital technologies across these methodologies can detect precise measures of cognition, mood, sleep, gait, speech, motor activity, behavior patterns, and additional features relevant to health. As a neurodegenerative condition with insidious onset, Alzheimer disease and other dementias (AD/D) represent a key target for advances in monitoring disease symptoms. Studies to date evaluating the predictive power of digital measures use inconsistent approaches to characterize these measures. Comparison between different digital collection methods supports the use of passive collection methods in settings in which active participant engagement approaches are not feasible. Additional studies that analyze how digital measures across multiple data streams can together improve prediction of cognitive impairment and early-stage AD are needed. Given the long timeline of progression from normal to diagnosis, digital monitoring will more easily make extended longitudinal follow-up possible. Through the American Heart Association-funded Strategically Focused Research Network, the Boston University investigative team deployed a platform involving a wide range of technologies to address these gaps in research practice. Much more research is needed to thoroughly evaluate limitations of passive monitoring. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to establish legal and ethical frameworks for ensuring passive monitoring can be conducted at scale while protecting privacy and security, especially in vulnerable populations.",2024,Alzheimer disease; cognition; digital health; multimodal data; passive monitoring,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Boston,"Popp, Z; Low, S; Igwe, A; Rahman, MS; Kim, M; Khan, R; Oh, E; Kumar, A; De Anda-Duran, I; Ding, H; Hwang, PH; Sunderaraman, P; Shih, LC; Lin, H; Kolachalama, VB; Au, R"

Refining Cultural Adaptations of a Behavioral Intervention for Latino Caregivers of People Living With Dementia: Qualitative Interview Study in Washington State.," In the United States, Latino caregivers of individuals with dementia face unique challenges and an elevated risk of adverse health outcomes. Despite the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias among Latino adults, few evidence-based interventions are tailored to their cultural context. To address this gap, we examined the cultural adaptations required for the STAR caregivers (STAR-C) virtual intervention, an evidence-based intervention that educates family caregivers to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. While STAR-C has shown effectiveness, neither the original in-person nor the virtual intervention considered the distinct experiences of Latino caregivers, who often bring culturally significant values into caregiving interactions.",2024,Alzheimer; Alzheimer disease; Hispanic; Hispanic or Latino; Hispanics; Latin; Latina; Latinas; Latino; Latinos; Latinx; STAR caregiver; STAR-C; Spanish; adaptation; adaptations; ageing; aging; alzheimers; attitude; attitudes; care giving; caregiver; caregivers; caregiving; carer; carers; cultural; culturally; dementia; digital health; eHealth; education; educational; experience; experiences; families; family; family care; geriatric; geriatrics; gerontology; informal care; internet; interview; memory; memory loss; mental health; mobile phone; module; modules; neuro; old age; older adults; online; opinion; perception; perceptions; perspective; perspectives; qualitative; qualitative research; training; web-based,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Caregivers; Hispanic or Latino; Qualitative Research; Washington; Dementia; Culturally Competent Care,"Garcia, CN; Duran, MC; Ramirez, M"
A SINE-VNTR-Alu at the LRIG2 locus is associated with proximal and distal gene expression in CRISPR and population models.,"SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons represent mobile regulatory elements that have the potential to influence the surrounding genome when they insert into a locus. Evolutionarily recent mobilisation has resulted in loci in the human genome where a given retrotransposon might be observed to be present or absent, termed a retrotransposon insertion polymorphism (RIP). We previously observed that an SVA RIP ~ 2 kb upstream of LRIG2 on chromosome 1, the 'LRIG2 SVA', was associated with differences in local gene expression and methylation, and that the two were correlated. Here, we have used CRISPR-mediated deletion of the LRIG2 SVA in a cell line model to validate that presence of the retrotransposon is directly affecting local expression and provide evidence that is suggestive of a modest role for the SVA in modulating nearby methylation. Additionally, in leveraging an available Hi-C dataset we observed that the LRIG2 SVA was also involved in long-range chromatin interactions with a cluster of genes ~ 300 kb away, and that expression of these genes was to varying degrees associated with dosage of the SVA in both CRISPR cell line and population models. Altogether, these data support a regulatory role for SVAs in the modulation of gene expression, with the latter potentially involving chromatin looping, consistent with the model that RIPs may contribute to interpersonal differences in transcriptional networks.",2024,,Humans; Retroelements; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements; Chromatin; Gene Expression; Membrane Glycoproteins,"Hall, A; Middlehurst, B; Cadogan, MAM; Reed, X; Billingsley, KJ; Bubb, VJ; Quinn, JP"

NEMO reshapes the α-Synuclein aggregate interface and acts as an autophagy adapter by co-condensation with p62.,"NEMO is a ubiquitin-binding protein which regulates canonical NF-κB pathway activation in innate immune signaling, cell death regulation and host-pathogen interactions. Here we identify an NF-κB-independent function of NEMO in proteostasis regulation by promoting autophagosomal clearance of protein aggregates. NEMO-deficient cells accumulate misfolded proteins upon proteotoxic stress and are vulnerable to proteostasis challenges. Moreover, a patient with a mutation in the NEMO-encoding IKBKG gene resulting in defective binding of NEMO to linear ubiquitin chains, developed a widespread mixed brain proteinopathy, including α-synuclein, tau and TDP-43 pathology. NEMO amplifies linear ubiquitylation at α-synuclein aggregates and promotes the local concentration of p62 into foci. In vitro, NEMO lowers the threshold concentrations required for ubiquitin-dependent phase transition of p62. In summary, NEMO reshapes the aggregate surface for efficient autophagosomal clearance by providing a mobile phase at the aggregate interphase favoring co-condensation with p62.",2023,,Humans; NF-kappa B; I-kappa B Kinase; alpha-Synuclein; Ubiquitin; Autophagy,"Furthmann, N; Bader, V; Angersbach, L; Blusch, A; Goel, S; Sánchez-Vicente, A; Krause, LJ; Chaban, SA; Grover, P; Trinkaus, VA; van Well, EM; Jaugstetter, M; Tschulik, K; Damgaard, RB; Saft, C; Ellrichmann, G; Gold, R; Koch, A; Englert, B; Westenberger, A; Klein, C; Jungbluth, L; Sachse, C; Behrends, C; Glatzel, M; Hartl, FU; Nakamura, K; Christine, CW; Huang, EJ; Tatzelt, J; Winklhofer, KF"

Digital phenotyping: An equal opportunity approach to reducing disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"A rapidly aging world population is fueling a concomitant increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Scientific inquiry, however, has largely focused on White populations in Australia, the European Union, and North America. As such, there is an incomplete understanding of AD in other populations. In this perspective, we describe research efforts and challenges of cohort studies from three regions of the world: Central America, East Africa, and East Asia. These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

Optimized Convolutional Fusion for Multimodal Neuroimaging in Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis: Enhancing Data Integration and Feature Extraction.,"Multimodal neuroimaging has gained traction in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis by integrating information from multiple imaging modalities to enhance classification accuracy. However, effectively handling heterogeneous data sources and overcoming the challenges posed by multiscale transform methods remains a significant hurdle. This article proposes a novel approach to address these challenges. To harness the power of diverse neuroimaging data, we employ a strategy that leverages optimized convolution techniques. These optimizations include varying kernel sizes and the incorporation of instance normalization, both of which play crucial roles in feature extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Specifically, varying kernel sizes allow us to adapt the receptive field to different image characteristics, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant information. Furthermore, we employ transposed convolution, which increases spatial resolution of feature maps, and it is optimized with varying kernel sizes and instance normalization. This heightened resolution facilitates the alignment and integration of data from disparate MRI and PET data. The use of larger kernels and strides in transposed convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to capture essential cross-modal relationships. Instance normalization, applied to each modality during the fusion process, mitigates potential biases stemming from differences in intensity, contrast, or scale between modalities. This enhancement contributes to improved model performance by reducing complexity and ensuring robust fusion. The performance of the proposed fusion method is assessed on three distinct neuroimaging datasets, which include: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD, and Early Mild Cognitive); Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, Mild Dementia, Very Mild Dementia); and whole-brain atlas neuroimaging (AANLIB) (consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD). To evaluate the quality of the fused images generated via our method, we employ a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), which assesses the structural similarity between two images; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which measures how closely the generated image resembles the ground truth; Entropy (E), which assesses the amount of information preserved or lost during fusion; the Feature Similarity Indexing Method (FSIM), which assesses the structural and feature similarities between two images; and Edge-Based Similarity (EBS), which measures the similarity of edges between the fused and ground truth images. The obtained fused image is further evaluated using a Mobile Vision Transformer. In the classification of AD vs. Cognitive Normal, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.00%, specificity of 99.00%, and sensitivity of 98.44% on the AANLIB dataset.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; data integration; feature extraction; multimodal neuroimaging; optimized convolution,,"Odusami, M; Maskeliūnas, R; Damaševičius, R"

Age and sex effects on Super G performance are consistent across internet devices.,"There have been recent advances in the application of online games that assess motor skill acquisition/learning and its relationship to age and biological sex, both of which are associated with dementia risk. While this online motor learning assessment (called Super G), along with other computer-based cognitive tests, was originally developed to be completed on a computer, many people (including older adults) have been shown to access the internet through a mobile device. Thus, to improve the generalizability of our online motor skill learning game, it must not only be compatible with mobile devices but also yield replicable effects of various participant characteristics on performance relative to the computer-based version. It is unknown if age and sex differentially affect game performance as a function of device type (keyboard versus touchscreen control). Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate if device type modifies the established effects of age and sex on performance. Although there was a main effect of device on performance, this effect did not alter the overall relationship between performance vs. age or sex. This establishes that Super G can now effectively be extended to both computer and mobile platforms to further test for dementia risk factors.",2023,Aging; Computer Game; Dementia; Mobile Game; Motor Performance; Sex,,"Hooyman, A; Schaefer, SY"
Results of the Italian RESILIEN-T Pilot Study: A Mobile Health Tool to Support Older People with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"(1) Background: The RESILIEN-T system addresses the need for innovative solutions to support self-management in older people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

Data were collected through questionnaires and user interactions with the system over a three-month period. (3) Results: Quantitative outcomes showed no significant differences between the intervention and control groups, except for an improvement in perceived memory capability in the intervention group. The usability assessment indicated a high level of acceptance of the RESILIEN-T system. (4) Discussions: Although no significant improvements were observed in most quantitative measures, the high user engagement and acceptance suggest the potential effectiveness of the RESILIEN-T system.

No link between handedness and spatial navigation: evidence from over 400 000 participants in 41 countries.,"There is an active debate concerning the association of handedness and spatial ability. Past studies used small sample sizes. Determining the effect of handedness on spatial ability requires a large, cross-cultural sample of participants and a navigation task with real-world validity. Here, we overcome these challenges via the mobile app Sea Hero Quest. We analysed the navigation performance from 422 772 participants from 41 countries and found no reliable evidence for any difference in spatial ability between left- and right-handers across all countries. A small but growing gap in performance appears for participants over 64 years old, with left-handers outperforming right-handers.

Physical activity monitoring in Alzheimer's disease during sport interventions: a multi-methodological perspective.,"Assessment methods for physical activity and fitness are of upmost importance due to the possible beneficial effect of physical conditioning on neurodegenerative diseases. The implementation of these methods can be challenging when examining elderly or cognitively impaired participants. In the presented study, we compared three different assessment methods for physical activity from the Dementia-MOVE trial, a 6-months intervention study on physical activity in Alzheimer's disease. The aim was to determine the comparability of physical activity assessments in elderly participants with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; exercise; fitness; fitness tracker; mobile health; physical activity intervention; wearables,,"David, S; Hohenfeld, C; Haberl, L; Pahl, J; Costa, AS; Kilders, A; Hildebrand, F; Schulz, JB; Reetz, K; Haeger, A"
Precision Medicine Approach to Alzheimer's Disease: Rationale and Implications.,"The neurodegenerative disease field has enjoyed extremely limited success in the development of effective therapeutics. One potential reason is the lack of disease models that yield accurate predictions and optimal therapeutic targets. Standard clinical trials have pre-determined a single treatment modality, which may be unrelated to the primary drivers of neurodegeneration. Recent proof-of-concept clinical trials using a precision medicine approach suggest a new model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a chronic innate encephalitis that creates a network insufficiency. Identifying and addressing the multiple potential contributors to cognitive decline for each patient may represent a more effective strategy. Here we review the rationale for a precision medicine approach in prevention and treatment of cognitive decline associated with AD. Results and implications from recent proof-of-concept clinical trials are presented. Randomized controlled trials, with much larger patient numbers, are likely to be significant to establishing precision medicine protocols as a standard of care for prevention and treatment of cognitive decline. Furthermore, combining this approach with the pharmaceutical approach offers the potential for enhanced outcomes. However, incorporating precision medicine approaches into everyday evaluation and care, as well as future clinical trials, would require fundamental changes in trial design, IRB considerations, funding considerations, laboratory evaluation, personalized treatment plans, treatment teams, and ultimately in reimbursement guidelines. Nonetheless, precision medicine approaches to AD, based on a novel model of AD pathophysiology, offer promise that has not been realized to date with monotherapeutic approaches.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; MRI volumetrics; clinical trial; mild cognitive impairment; neurodegeneration; systems,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Precision Medicine; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Bredesen, DE; Toups, K; Hathaway, A; Gordon, D; Chung, H; Raji, C; Boyd, A; Hill, BD; Hausman-Cohen, S; Attarha, M; Chwa, WJ; Kurakin, A; Jarrett, M"
Self-Administered Gentle Yoga and Yoga Breathing Intervention Improves Burden and Stress Biomarkers in Caregivers of Persons Living with Dementia.,"Family caregivers of adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the fastest growing group of informal healthcare providers in the United States. These individuals experience high levels of stress and physical and psychosocial symptoms related to their caregiving role. We provided 20 ADRD caregivers (≥ 55 years of age) with training and access to a mobile health app for at-home practice of gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises. Here, we report secondary outcomes, including changes in caregiver physical and mental function, burden, fatigue, sleep, and biological stress markers (salivary cortisol and 1,5-anhydroglucitol [1,5-AG] assays) from Baseline (Week 1) to Study End (Week 12). Self-reported questionnaire data were collected online via the Research Electronic Data Capture system, and biomarker data were collected via saliva samples. Results supported indications for slight improvement in outcomes of caregiving burden among ADRD caregivers using the gentle yoga and yoga breathing app. Furthermore, slight improvements in mental health were observed; the greatest gains were made by those reporting higher burden and having family members with more severe dementias. Findings indicate that those experiencing the greatest improvement in caregiver burden scores spent the most time doing gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises. Salivary stress biomarkers moved in a favorable direction (decreased cortisol; increased 1,5-AG) among caregivers practicing the exercises most often. This is among the first studies of gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises for relieving ADRD caregiver burden and the first we are aware of to incorporate stress biomarker measurement.",2023,Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; caregivers; mindfulness intervention; mobile health; stress biomarkers; yoga,Adult; Humans; Caregivers; Yoga; Hydrocortisone; Dementia; Biomarkers,"Balasubramanian, S; Mueller, M; Madisetti, M; Hendrix, K; Kelechi, TJ"

Service Design of a Loss Prevention Device for Older Adults with Dementia.,"This aim of this research was to explore the appraisal of the use of smart alert bracelets by older adults diagnosed with dementia. Convenience sampling was adopted to recruit older adults with dementia in Yunlin County, Taiwan. A manual questionnaire survey was conducted, and SPSS 26.0 statistical software was used for analysis. The results of this study showed noticeable positive correlation results in the post-test for the modes ""wearing device"", ""degree of dementia"", and ""field configuration"". Based on the experimental results, the following suggestions are provided: (1) in terms of statistical calculation, the statistical results were affected by changes in some participants; (2) as for the design of equipment, to be more suitable for adult use, the size and color of bracelets need to be optimized; (3) as for the problem of battery charging of the device, because the charging location of the device is not easy to find, it is better to extend device standby time; (4) regarding the selection of equipment, older adults with early-stage dementia could be concerned about the function of the wearable device, so it is recommended to provide a device designed with clear functions, such as a watch, so that older adults are more willing to wear it. Patients diagnosed with moderate and severe dementia should be advised to use concealed non-sensory devices, such as charms and cards, to better facilitate assistance from caregivers in wearing them; and (5) as for the device, in case of a loss event, in addition to mobile phone notifications, other light and sound device notifications can be added, allowing caregivers to pay more attention to information in real time. In summary, the feedback from caregivers and older adults suggests that if the device is to be used without charging, the overall design should be light and small, which is more suitable for service designs.",2023,convenience sampling; degree of dementia; elderly dementia; smart alert bracelet; wearable device,,"Hsu, CK; Liu, CC; Chang, T; Liao, JJ; Shu, CM"
Virtual Dementia-Friendly Communities (Verily Connect) Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomised Controlled Trial: Improving Dementia Caregiver Wellbeing in Rural Australia.,"Caring for people living with dementia often leads to social isolation and decreased support for caregivers. This study investigated the effect of a Virtual Dementia-Friendly Rural Communities (Verily Connect) model on social support and demand for caregivers of people living with dementia. The co-designed intervention entailed an integrated website and mobile application, peer-support videoconference, and technology learning hubs. This mixed-methods, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted with 113 participants from 12 rural communities in Australia. Caregiver data were collected using MOS-SSS and ZBI between 2018 and 2020. The relationship between post-intervention social support with age, years of caring, years since diagnosis, and duration of intervention were explored through correlation analysis and thin plate regression. Google Analytics were analysed for levels of engagement, and cost analysis was performed for implementation. Results showed that caregivers' perception of social support (MOS-SSS) increased over 32 weeks (",2023,age friendly; caregiver; community; dementia; mobile application; rural; virtual,,"Blackberry, I; Rasekaba, T; Morgan, D; Royals, K; Greenhill, J; Perkins, D; O'Connell, M; Hamiduzzaman, M; Winbolt, M; Robinson, A; Davis, H; Wilding, C"
Microglia in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanism and potential therapeutic targets.,"Microglia activation is observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revealed that these reactive microglia were with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Some identified microglia in specific states correlate with pathological hallmarks and are associated with specific functions. Microglia both exert protective function by phagocytosing and clearing pathological protein aggregates and play detrimental roles due to excessive uptake of protein aggregates, which would lead to microglial phagocytic ability impairment, neuroinflammation, and eventually neurodegeneration. In addition, peripheral immune cells infiltration shapes microglia into a pro-inflammatory phenotype and accelerates disease progression. Microglia also act as a mobile vehicle to propagate protein aggregates. Extracellular vesicles released from microglia and autophagy impairment in microglia all contribute to pathological progression and neurodegeneration. Thus, enhancing microglial phagocytosis, reducing microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, inhibiting microglial exosome synthesis and secretion, and promoting microglial conversion into a protective phenotype are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we comprehensively review the biology of microglia and the roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and Huntington's disease.

Assessing the Global Cognition of Community-Dwelling Older Adults Using Motor and Sensory Factors: A Cross-Sectional Feasibility Study.,"Impairments in gait, postural stability, and sensory functions were proved to be strongly associated with severe cognitive impairment such as in dementia. However, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to detect cognitive deterioration early, which requires a deeper understanding of the connections between the aforementioned functions and global cognition. Therefore, the current study measured gait, postural, auditory, and visual functions and, using principal component analysis, explored their individual and cumulative association with global cognition. The global cognitive function of 82 older Korean males was determined using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The motor and sensory functions were summarized into seven independent factors using factor analysis, followed by age and education-level-adjusted linear regression model analysis. The seven factors obtained using factor analysis were gait speed, gait stability, midstance, general auditory ability, auditory recognition, overall visual ability, and postural stability. The linear regression model included years of education, gait stability, postural stability, and auditory recognition, and was able to explain more than half of the variability in cognitive score. This shows that motor and sensory parameters, which are obtainable through wearable sensors and mobile applications, could be utilized in detecting cognitive fluctuations even in the early stages of cognitive deterioration.",2023,PCA; cognitive function; dementia; gait; sensory functions,Male; Humans; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feasibility Studies; Independent Living; Cognition; Dementia,"Kostic, E; Kwak, K; Kim, D"
DAUF: A disease-related attentional UNet framework for progressive and stable mild cognitive impairment identification.,"Identifying progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) and stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) plays a significant role in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, which can effectively boost the life quality of patients. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN)- based methods using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images have shown effective for AD identification. However, these CNN-based methods fail to effectively explore the feature extraction of disease-related multi-scale tissues, such as ventricles, hippocampi and cerebral cortex. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end disease-related attentional UNet framework (DAUF) for identifying pMCI and sMCI, by embedding a devised dual disease-related attention module (D",2023,Complementary attention module; Disease-related attentional UNet framework; Identifying progressive and stable mild cognitive impairment; Tree-structured feature fusion,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cerebral Cortex; Cognitive Dysfunction; Heart Ventricles; Hippocampus,"Zhang, Z; Gao, L; Li, P; Jin, G; Wang, J"

Use of Community-Engaged Research Approaches in Clinical Interventions for Neurologic Disorders in the United States: A Scoping Review and Future Directions for Improving Health Equity Research.,"Evidence suggests a significant prevalence of race and ethnic disparities in the United States among people with neurologic conditions including stroke, Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD), Parkinson disease (PD), epilepsy, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent neurologic research has begun the paradigm shift from observational health disparities research to intervention research in an effort to narrow the disparities gap. There is an evidence base that suggests that community engagement is a necessary component of health equity. While the increase in disparities focused neurologic interventions is encouraging, it remains unclear whether and how community-engaged practices are integrated into intervention design and implementation. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and synthesize intervention studies that have actively engaged with the community in the design and implementation of interventions to reduce disparities in neurologic conditions and to describe the common community engagement processes used.",2023,,Health Equity; Health Services Research; Humans; Community Participation; Nervous System Diseases; United States; Healthcare Disparities,"Boden-Albala, B; Rebello, V; Drum, E; Gutierrez, D; Smith, WR; Whitmer, RA; Griffith, DM"

Deep-learning detection of mild cognitive impairment from sleep electroencephalography for patients with Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease which is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the United States is a serious and complex disease that may progress to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The early detection of the mild cognitive impairment and the identification of its biomarkers is crucial to support neurologists in monitoring the progression of the disease and allow an early initiation of effective therapeutic treatments that will improve the quality of life for the patients. In this paper, we propose the first deep-learning based approaches to detect mild cognitive impairment in the sleep Electroencephalography for patients with Parkinson's disease and further identify the discriminative features of the disease. The proposed frameworks start by segmenting the sleep Electroencephalography time series into three sleep stages (i.e., two non-rapid eye movement sleep-stages and one rapid eye movement sleep stage), further transforming the segmented signals in the time-frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform and the variational mode decomposition and finally applying novel convolutional neural networks on the time-frequency representations. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping was also used to visualize the features based on which the proposed deep-learning approaches reached an accurate prediction of mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. The proposed variational mode decomposition-based model offered a superior accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under curve, and quadratic weighted Kappa score, all above 99% as compared with the continuous wavelet transform-based model (that achieved a performance that is almost above 92%) in differentiating mild cognitive impairment from normal cognition in sleep Electroencephalography for patients with Parkinson's disease. In addition, the features attributed to the mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease were demonstrated by changes in the middle and high frequency variational mode decomposition components across the three sleep-stages. The use of the proposed model on the time-frequency representation of the sleep Electroencephalography signals will provide a promising and precise computer-aided diagnostic tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment and hence, monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease.",2023,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Deep Learning; Quality of Life; Cognitive Dysfunction; Sleep; Electroencephalography,"Parajuli, M; Amara, AW; Shaban, M"

Video-Based Activity Recognition for Automated Motor Assessment of Parkinson's Disease.,"Over the last decade, video-enabled mobile devices have become ubiquitous, while advances in markerless pose estimation allow an individual's body position to be tracked accurately and efficiently across the frames of a video. Previous work by this and other groups has shown that pose-extracted kinematic features can be used to reliably measure motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). This presents the prospect of developing an asynchronous and scalable, video-based assessment of motor dysfunction. Crucial to this endeavour is the ability to automatically recognise the class of an action being performed, without which manual labelling is required. Representing the evolution of body joint locations as a spatio-temporal graph, we implement a deep-learning model for video and frame-level classification of activities performed according to part 3 of the Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). We train and validate this system using a dataset of n = 7310 video clips, recorded at 5 independent sites. This approach reaches human-level performance in detecting and classifying periods of activity within monocular video clips. Our framework could support clinical workflows and patient care at scale through applications such as quality monitoring of clinical data collection, automated labelling of video streams, or a module within a remote self-assessment system.",2023,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Severity of Illness Index; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Biomechanical Phenomena,"Sarapata, G; Dushin, Y; Morinan, G; Ong, J; Budhdeo, S; Kainz, B; O'Keeffe, J"

A Mobile Application for Supporting and Monitoring Elderly Population to Perform the Interventions of the FINGER Study.,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease that is caused by the destruction of brain neurons. It seems it affects a large group of the world's population that is estimated around 47 million and is expected to triple by 2050. Slowly but surely, the patient's condition is deteriorating, due to the increase of symptom severity, rendering him/her in need of special care. A great percentage of these cases can be attributed to some common modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, a lack of exercise, alcohol misuse, smoking, unhealthy diet, and a low level of education. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study (FINGER Study) proves that some interventions focused on the abovementioned risk factors of the individual's daily life can contribute to delay the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease. Concurrently, the rapid development of smart devices encourages the use of health applications that provide guiding tools and suggestions based on the user's status. The outcome of this paper is the development of a mobile application, to implement and monitor the interventions proposed by the FINGER Study.

Using Biomarkers for Cognitive Enhancement and Evaluation in Mobile Applications.,"Clinicians are increasingly using biomarkers to diagnose and monitor cognitive conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Biomarkers are classified into two main categories based on their clinical goal: disease-associated biomarkers and drug-related biomarkers. In the case of disease-associated biomarkers, neuroimaging biomarkers are used to predict and validate Alzheimer's disease at any of its stages including mild cognitive impairment. The use of mobile and wearable devices to collect data about a person's daily activities and behaviors has led to the emergence of a new type of biomarker known as digital biomarkers. This type of data provides a digital reflection of a person's function in the context of everyday life and can be used to monitor and track changes in an individual's health and behaviors over time. The use of biomarkers in mobile applications for cognitive enhancement and evaluation can provide valuable insights into an individual's cognitive health and can help to optimize treatment and prevention strategies.",2023,Biomarkers; Cognitive enhancement; Digital biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Mobile Applications; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Disease Progression; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Giannopoulou, P; Vlamos, P"

Efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies in current Alzheimer's disease phase III clinical trials: A systematic review and interactive web app-based meta-analysis.,"The risk-benefit profile of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear, especially concerning their safety and overall effects on AD progression and cognitive function. Here, we investigated cognitive, biomarker and side effects of anti-Aβ mAbs in large phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in sporadic AD. The search was performed on Google Scholar, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov by applying Jadad score to evaluate the methodological quality of the reports. Studies were excluded if they scored < 3 on Jadad scale or if they analyzed less than 200 sporadic AD patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model in R. Primary outcomes were cognitive: AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary and tertiary outcomes included biomarkers of Aβ and tau pathology, adverse events, and performance on Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Scale. The meta-analysis included 14,980 patients in 14 studies and four mAbs: Bapineuzumab, Aducanumab, Solanezumab and Lecanemab. The results of this study suggest that anti-Aβ mAbs statistically improved cognitive and biomarker outcomes, particularly Aducanumab and Lecanemab.

A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk: Design and methodology of a randomized clinical trial.,"Aging populations are at increased risk of sleep deficiencies (e.g., insomnia) that are associated with a variety of chronic health risks, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Insomnia medications carry additional risk, including increased drowsiness and falls, as well as polypharmacy risks. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), but access is limited. Telehealth is one way to increase access, particularly for older adults, but to date telehealth has been typically limited to simple videoconferencing portals. While these portals have been shown to be non-inferior to in-person treatment, it is plausible that telehealth could be significantly improved. This work describes a protocol designed to evaluate whether a clinician-patient dashboard inclusive of several user-friendly features (e.g., patterns of sleep data from ambulatory devices, guided relaxation resources, and reminders to complete in-home CBTi practice) could improve CBTi outcomes for middle- to older-aged adults (N = 100). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three telehealth interventions delivered through 6-weekly sessions: (1) CBTi augmented with a clinician-patient dashboard, smartphone application, and integrated smart devices; (2) standard CBTi (i.e., active comparator); or (3) sleep hygiene education (i.e., active control). All participants were assessed at screening, pre-study evaluation, baseline, throughout treatment, and at 1-week post-treatment. The primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index. Secondary and exploratory outcomes span sleep diary, actiwatch and Apple watch assessed sleep parameters (e.g., efficiency, duration, timing, variability), psychosocial correlates (e.g., fatigue, depression, stress), cognitive performance, treatment adherence, and neurodegenerative and systemic inflammatory biomarkers.",2023,Cognitive behavioral therapy; Insomnia disorder; Internet of things; Sleep hygiene; Treatment; mHealth,Humans; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Treatment Outcome; Sleep; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Emert, SE; Taylor, DJ; Gartenberg, D; Schade, MM; Roberts, DM; Nagy, SM; Russell, M; Huskey, A; Mueller, M; Gamaldo, A; Buxton, OM"

Refinement of Health App Review Tool (HART) through stakeholder interviews: HART 2.0.,"The Health App Review Tool (HART) is a novel assessment designed to match users with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) and caregivers to mobile applications that support health and wellness. The objectives of this study were to gather stakeholder feedback on the HART and then to implement revisions. Thirteen participants completed in-depth Think Aloud interviews. Participants shared qualitative feedback on each HART item. Participant feedback was analyzed via in-depth video-audio review. Feedback was implemented as actionable HART revisions. On average, the majority of participants rated items as ""adequate""; however, qualitative findings indicated the need for improvement in conciseness, clarity, and understandability. Conciseness was addressed by combining related concepts into multi-items, clarity through the addition of specific examples, and understandability through improved verbiage.

The role of performativity in informal dementia carers' capability to be mobile.,"Informal carers are and will remain a vital part of dementia care. Given the nature of their caring tasks, which focus on enabling the care recipient to engage in meaningful activities, informal dementia carers are affected in their everyday mobility. Expectations manifested by society, loved ones and the carers themselves play a critical role in how carers perform their caring role and how they perceive their opportunity, or capability, to be mobile. This article uses Butler's concept of performativity to understand informal dementia carers' capability to be mobile. In the spring and summer of 2021, we combined remote graphic elicitation with telephone interviews to gather the views of 17 informal dementia carers (aged 50+) living in England. Three key themes emerged from our analysis of the data. Firstly, participants perceived that becoming a carer changed their capability to be mobile. Secondly, the caring role in relation to the capability to be mobile resulted in an emotional toll and perceived loss of autonomy. Thirdly, the performativity of the caring role created feelings of guilt, selfishness and resentment due to the impact caring had on participants' capability to be mobile. Our study enriches the literature on informal dementia carers' mobility, as we suggest that performativity is a key factor in how this population experiences their everyday mobility. The findings suggest that existing ageing-in-place policies should take a more holistic approach by better including those ageing adults who provide the most support: informal dementia carers.",2023,Capability approach; England; Informal dementia carer; Mobility; Older adults,Adult; Humans; Dementia; Caregivers; England; Emotions; Guilt,"Lowe, TA; Meijering, L; de Haas, B"
An update on mobile applications collecting data among subjects with or at risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Smart mobile phone use is increasing worldwide, as is the ability of mobile devices to monitor daily routines, behaviors, and even cognitive changes. There is a growing opportunity for users to share the data collected with their medical providers which may serve as an accessible cognitive impairment screening tool. Data logged or tracked in an app and analyzed with machine learning (ML) could identify subtle cognitive changes and lead to more timely diagnoses on an individual and population level. This review comments on existing evidence of mobile device applications designed to passively and/or actively collect data on cognition relevant for early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The PubMed database was searched to identify existing literature on apps related to dementia and cognitive health data collection. The initial search deadline was December 1, 2022. Additional literature published in 2023 was accounted for with a follow-up search prior to publication.

[Mobile everyday-life digital technologies for the prevention of Alzheimer's dementia: cognitive health and cognitive safety].,"It is generally accepted that the treatment of Alzheimer's disease should be flanked by preventive measures for risk reduction in order to maintain cognitive functions for as long as possible; however, the research and development of treatment concepts are both faced with challenges. The preventive risk reduction necessitates a high level of coordination of neurology and psychiatry with other disciplines. Also, patients must develop a high level of health competence and summon up self-motivation and adherence. This concept article deals with the question of how mobile everyday-life digital technologies can help to address these challenges. The core prerequisite is the interdisciplinary coordinated structuring of prevention with the focus on cognitive health and cognitive safety. Cognitive health relates to a reduction of risk factors associated with lifestyle. Cognitive safety concerns the avoidance of iatrogenic side effects on cognitive functions. Digital technologies that are relevant in this context are mobile apps based on smartphones or tablets for everyday-life and high-frequency recording of cognitive functions, apps that can coach the implementation of lifestyle changes as companion technologies, apps that can assist in the reduction of iatrogenic risks and those that can improve the health competence of patients and relatives. The state of development of such medical products is at different stages of progress. Therefore, this concept article does not provide a review of existing products but rather deals with the fundamental interplay of potential solutions in the prevention of Alzheimer dementia in the areas of cognitive health and cognitive safety.",2023,Health competence; Interdisciplinary medicine; Preventive measures; Risk reduction; Treatment concepts,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Digital Technology; Cognition; Smartphone; Mobile Applications,"Düzel, E; Thyrian, JR"

According to the WHO's latest report, 23% of adults fail to meet the minimum recommended level of PA. The percentage was even higher in a recent global study that showed 27% of adults were insufficiently active and reported a 5% increase in the prevalence trend of insufficient PA between 2001 and 2016. The study also showed the rate of insufficient PA among countries varied significantly. For instance, it was estimated that 40% were insufficiently active in the United States, and the percentage was even higher in Saudi Arabia (more than 50%).

Expert's View on Central Components of the Actional Model of Older People's Coping with Health-Related Declines: A Pilot Study with Professional Caregivers.,"Abri & Boll (2022) proposed the ""Actional Model of Older People´s Coping with Health-Related Declines"" to explain the use of various action alternatives of older persons for dealing with diseases, functional declines, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. It draws on a broad knowledge base: an action-theoretical model of intentional self-development, models of the use of assistive technologies (ATs) and medical services, qualitative studies on reasons for using or not-using ATs, and quantitative studies on older people's health-related goals. The present study aims to gather evidence to further refine this model by additionally relying on expert knowledge from professional caregivers serving older people. Six experienced geriatric nurses working in mobile care services or residential care facilities were interviewed about key components of the above model in relation to 17 older people aged 70 to 95 with stroke, arthrosis, or mild dementia. The results revealed additional goals of reducing or preventing health-related discrepancies beyond those already included in the model (e.g., moving without pain, doing things alone, driving a car again, social return). Moreover, new motivating or demotivating goals for using certain action possibilities were found (e.g., to be at home, to be alone, to rest, to motivate other older people). Finally, some new factors were identified from the biological-functional (e.g., illness, fatigue), technological (e.g., pain inducing ATs, maladaptive devices), and social contexts (e.g., lack of staff time) that are likely to promote or hinder the use of certain action possibilities.

[The Role of Nurses in Bridging the Health Literacy Gap: Empowering Patients in the Post-Pandemic Era].,"Health literacy (HL) is an essential ability used by people throughout life to access, understand, appraise, and apply health related information and services and is widely recognized as a key determinant of health. HL has been the focus of increasing international attention in the 21st century, with the World Health Organization identifying HL as a 2030 sustainable development target (World Health Organization, 2016). ""Strengthening health communication and improving HL nationwide"" is also an issue targeted in a Taiwan government white paper for improvement by 2025. Key related actions and strategies noted in this paper include investigating the HL of each life course; disseminating accurate, easy-to-access, and implementable health and safety information; improving the public's awareness and use of mobile tools; using multiple marketing models (public, organization, interpersonal communication); combining cloud technology to develop a health management system; setting up websites; providing cloud care; and developing other e-media (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2016). The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly challenged the global healthcare system as well as individual health. Due to the difficulties and uncertainties associated with emerging diseases, updating regularly changing information in a timely manner is not easy. Ensuring public access to and application of updated information is a key challenge to improving public HL. Abel & McQueen (2020) pointed out that ""critical health literacy"", the ability of individuals to reflect on complex health issues and critically evaluate available information, will be the key to promoting and enhancing healthy behaviors in response to emerging diseases. Taiwan is rapidly moving toward becoming a super-aged society, at which time frail older adults, individuals with dementia, and individuals with disabilities and multiple chronic diseases are expected to be the primary targets of healthcare system services. During the pandemic, many individuals in vulnerable groups died quickly due to COVID-19-related severe illnesses, leaving their families with insufficient time to respond and adjust. This experience highlights the importance of palliative and end-of-life care communication with clients and of permitting family members to grieve. In addition, disease control measures such as isolation, wearing masks, and reducing visits to patients have also affected communication between people, widening the distance between patients, their families, and healthcare professionals. This experience has made us reflect on how to better use online and mobile tools to support self-care for patients and their families. In this issue, Professor Li first expounds on promoting HL in the elderly through the use of health education strategies such as formulating public policies related to HL, adjusting the orientation of health services, constructing a friendly environment for HL information dissemination, strengthening community resources for HL education, and promoting geriatric learning and shared decision-making. Professor Wu encourages nurses in long-term care facilities to apply the U-R-PEACE strategy to promote understanding, respect, planning, expression, act, care, and education in a manner that facilitates effective palliative care communication with patients and their families as early as possible. Because dementia care relies heavily on family caregivers, Professor Luo suggests using family-caregiver-created and managed Facebook groups to share health information and facilitate social support, shedding light on how to use social media to effectively empower caregivers. Interactions between patients and healthcare professionals are critical to effective healthcare delivery. The unequal power dynamic between physicians and patients may lead to communication conflicts, especially as generational replacement progresses and public health awareness improves. Facing the differences between these two interest groups, Professor Ye suggest nurses handle conflicts proactively by increasing their emotional drive to address disagreements, enhancing their cognitive abilities to handle interpersonal dynamics, and engaging actively in communicative measures.",2023,,"Aged; Humans; Pandemics; Health Literacy; COVID-19; Dementia; Power, Psychological","Kuo, CL"
The effects of a mobile-based multi-domain intervention on cognitive function among older adults.,"Behavioral and social research has stressed the importance of multi-domain lifestyle interventions to prevent, delay, or remedy age-related cognitive decline among older adults at high risk for dementia. In light of the benefits of multi-domain interventions, some studies demonstrate the effectiveness of a mobile-based program for dementia prevention. Unfortunately, there is limited evidence of whether or not a mobile application of a multi-domain program is effective in improving cognitive functioning among older adults who are a high risk for dementia. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a pre-post change of cognition and there were age-group differences in pre-post change after the 12 weeks multi-domain program, ",2023,Cognitive function; Dementia prevention; Digital health; Multi-domain lifestyle intervention,,"Kim, J; Ko, M; Lee, J; Kim, Y"

Aggregation-prone TDP-43 sequesters and drives pathological transitions of free nuclear TDP-43.,"Aggregation of the RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, is the unifying hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. TDP-43-related neurodegeneration involves multiple changes to normal physiological TDP-43, which undergoes nuclear depletion, cytoplasmic mislocalisation, post-translational modification, and aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation, preceding inclusion formation. Along with toxic cytoplasmic aggregation, concurrent depletion and dysfunction of normal nuclear TDP-43 in cells with TDP-43 pathology is likely a key potentiator of neurodegeneration, but is not well understood. To define processes driving TDP-43 dysfunction, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated fluorescent tagging to investigate how disease-associated stressors and pathological TDP-43 alter abundance, localisation, self-assembly, aggregation, solubility, and mobility dynamics of normal nuclear TDP-43 over time in live cells. Oxidative stress stimulated liquid-liquid phase separation of endogenous TDP-43 into droplet-like puncta, or spherical shell-like anisosomes. Further, nuclear RNA-binding-ablated or acetylation-mimicking TDP-43 readily sequestered and depleted free normal nuclear TDP-43 into dynamic anisosomes, in which recruited endogenous TDP-43 proteins remained soluble and highly mobile. Large, phosphorylated inclusions formed by nuclear or cytoplasmic aggregation-prone TDP-43 mutants also caused sequestration, but rendered endogenous TDP-43 immobile and insoluble, indicating pathological transition. These findings suggest that RNA-binding deficiency and post-translational modifications including acetylation exacerbate TDP-43 aggregation and dysfunction by driving sequestration, mislocalisation, and depletion of normal nuclear TDP-43 in neurodegenerative diseases.",2023,Acetylated TDP-43; Endogenous gene tagging; LLPS; Motor neuron disease; TDP-43 loss of function,Humans; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Cell Nucleus; Cytoplasm; DNA-Binding Proteins; Frontotemporal Dementia,"Keating, SS; Bademosi, AT; San Gil, R; Walker, AK"

How to set up a mobile X-ray unit in the community - Implementation initiatives for patient-centred care.,"Mobile X-ray unit have previously been widely used within hospitals in general, predominately for imaging patients admitted to intensive care units or for patients who cannot tolerate a visit to the radiology department. It is now possible to have an X-ray examination outside the hospital in nursing homes or to bring the service to frail, vulnerable or disabled patients. A visit to the hospital can be a frightening experience for vulnerable patients living with dementia or other neurological disorder. It can potentially have a long-term impact on the patient's recovery or behaviour.

Wayfinding and path integration deficits detected using a virtual reality mobile app in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"The ability to navigate is supported by a wide network of brain areas which are particularly vulnerable to disruption brain injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). Wayfinding and the ability to orient back to the direction you have recently come (path integration) may likely be impacted in daily life but have so far not been tested with patients with TBI. Here, we assessed spatial navigation in thirty-eight participants, fifteen of whom had a history of TBI, and twenty-three control participants. Self-estimated spatial navigation ability was assessed using the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction (SBSOD) scale. No significant difference between TBI patients and a control group was identified. Rather, results indicated that both participant groups demonstrated 'good' self-inferred spatial navigational ability on the SBSOD scale. Objective navigation ability was tested via the virtual mobile app test Sea Hero Quest (SHQ), which has been shown to predict real-world navigation difficulties and assesses (a) wayfinding across several environments and (b) path integration. Compared to a sub-sample of 13 control participants, a matched subsample of 10 TBI patients demonstrated generally poorer performance on all wayfinding environments tested. Further analysis revealed that TBI participants consistently spent a shorter duration viewing a map prior to navigating to goals. Patients showed mixed performance on the path integration task, with poor performance evident when proximal cues were absent. Our results provide preliminary evidence that TBI impacts both wayfinding and, to some extent, path integration. The findings suggest long-lasting clinical difficulties experienced in TBI patients affect both wayfinding and to some degree path integration ability.",2023,,"Humans; Mobile Applications; Brain; Spatial Navigation; Virtual Reality; Brain Injuries, Traumatic","Seton, C; Coutrot, A; Hornberger, M; Spiers, HJ; Knight, R; Whyatt, C"

Smartphone use as an efficient tool to improve anomia in primary progressive aphasia.,"Cognitive interventions are helpful in the non-pharmacological management of Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and other neurodegenerative disorders of cognition, by helping patients to compensate for their cognitive deficits and improve their functional independence. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation based on the use of mobile device technology in PPA. The aim of this research study was to determine if BL, a patient with semantic variant PPA (svPPA) and severe anomia, was able to learn using specific smartphone functions and an application to reduce her word finding difficulties. She was trained during the intervention sessions on a list of target pictures to measure changes in picture naming performance. Errorless learning was applied during learning. BL quickly learned to use smartphone functions and the application over the course of the intervention. She significantly improved her anomia for trained pictures, and to a lesser extent for untrained semantically related pictures. Picture naming performance was maintained six months after the intervention, and she continued to use her smartphone regularly to communicate with family members and friends. This study confirms that smartphone use can be learned in PPA, which can help reduce the symptoms of anomia and improve communication skills.",2024,Cognitive intervention; Errorless learning; Mobile technology; Primary progressive aphasia; Smartphone use,"Female; Humans; Anomia; Smartphone; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Aphasia; Semantics","Joubert, S; Maquestiaux, F; Enriquez-Rosas, A; Villalpando, JM; Brodeur, C; Bier, N"

Design and Evaluation of a Technological Platform for Monitoring Patients with Dementia: Unifying Requirements from Mexican Day Centers.,"The monitoring of patients with dementia who receive comprehensive care in day centers allows formal caregivers to make better decisions and provide better care to patients. For instance, cognitive and physical therapies can be tailored based on the current stage of disease progression. In the context of day centers of the Mexican Federation of Alzheimer, this work aims to design and evaluate Alzaid, a technological platform for assisting formal caregivers in monitoring patients with dementia. Alzaid was devised using a participatory design methodology that consisted in eliciting and validating requirements from 22 and 9 participants, respectively, which were unified to guide the construction of a high-fidelity prototype evaluated by 14 participants. The participants were formal caregivers, medical staff, and management. This work contributes a high-fidelity prototype of a technological platform for assisting formal caregivers in monitoring patients with dementia considering restrictions and requirements of four Mexican day centers. In general, the participants perceived the prototype as quite likely to be useful, usable, and relevant in the job of monitoring patients with dementia (p-value < 0.05).

Digital Intervention For The Management Of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial, chronic, neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence and limited therapeutic options, making it a global health crisis. Being the most common cause of dementia, AD erodes the cognitive, functional, and social abilities of the individual and causes escalating medical and psychosocial needs. As yet, this disorder has no cure and current treatment options are palliative in nature. There is an urgent need for novel therapy to address this pressing challenge. Digital therapeutics (Dtx) is one such novel therapy that is gaining popularity globally. Dtx provides evidence based therapeutic interventions driven by internet and software, employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames, apps, sensors, virtual reality aiding in the prevention, management, and treatment of ailments like neurological abnormalities and chronic diseases. Dtx acts as a supportive tool for the optimization of patient care, individualized treatment and improved health outcomes. Dtx uses visual, sound and other non-invasive approaches for instance-consistent therapy, reminiscence therapy, computerised cognitive training, semantic and phonological assistance devices, wearables and computer-assisted rehabilitation environment to find applications in Alzheimer's disease for improving memory, cognition, functional abilities and managing motor symptom. A few of the Dtx-based tools employed in AD include ""Memory Matters"", ""AlzSense"", ""Alzheimer Assistant"", ""smart robotic dog"", ""Immersive virtual reality (iVR)"" and the most current gamma stimulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current trends in digital health in AD and explore the benefits, challenges, and impediments of using Dtx as an adjunctive therapy for the management of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Dementia; Digital health.; Internet of things; Mobile apps; Reminiscence therapy,,"Manchanda, N; Aggarwal, A; Setya, S; Talegaonkar, S"

Neural signature of mobility-related everyday function in older adults at-risk of cognitive impairment.,"Assessment of everyday activities is central to the diagnosis of dementia. Yet, little is known about brain processes associated with everyday functional limitations, particularly during early stages of cognitive decline. Twenty-six older adults (mean = 74.9 y) were stratified by risk using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment battery (MoCA, range: 0- 30) to classify individuals as higher (22-26) and lower risk (27+) of cognitive impairment. We investigated everyday function using a gait task designed to destabilize posture and applied Mobile Brain/Body Imaging. We predicted that participants would increase step width to gain stability, yet the underlying neural signatures would be different for lower versus higher risk individuals. Step width and fronto-parietal activation increased during visually perturbed input. Frontomedial theta increased in higher risk individuals during perturbed and unperturbed inputs.

Bridging gaps in the design and implementation of socially assistive technologies for dementia care: the role of occupational therapy.,"Dementia is a global health challenge, and people living with dementia (PLWD) are especially susceptible to reduced engagement in meaningful occupations, including social participation. In the past few decades, socially assistive technologies continue to be developed amidst a rapidly evolving technological landscape to support the social health of PLWD and their caregivers. Examples include social robots, virtual reality, smart home technology, and various digital technologies, such as mobile applications for tablets and smartphones. Despite an increasing body of research and interest in this field, several gaps relating to the design and implementation process of socially assistive technologies continue to undermine their relevance for PLWD in daily life. In this paper, some of these gaps are highlighted and the role of occupational therapy in the design and implementation of socially assistive technology is presented. In the design process, occupational therapists are uniquely skilled to advise and advocate for the tailoring and personalisation of technology to address the occupational needs of PLWD. In the implementation of socially assistive technologies, occupational therapists are skilled to educate, train, and conduct ongoing evaluations with PLWD and their caregivers, to incorporate socially assistive technologies into their routine and daily lives. We recommend that occupational therapists should continue to be acquainted with such technologies through continuous professional development and educational curricula. Moreover, we highlight the necessary collaboration between occupational therapists, technology developers, and researchers to enhance the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology, so that their relevance for PLWD and their caregivers can be maximised.Implications for rehabilitationDevelopers and designers of socially assistive technology should consider the disease trajectory of different types of dementia, as well as the different needs, abilities, preferences, occupations and routines of people living with dementia (PLWD) and/or their caregivers.Collaborations between technology developers, researchers, and occupational therapists should take place iteratively throughout the process of designing and implementing socially assistive technology to maximise their relevance and applicability for people living with dementia and their caregivers.To continue enhancing the current role of occupational therapy in socially assistive technology provision, occupational therapists should keep up to date with socially assistive technology that are being developed to support the social health of PLWD.",2024,Occupational therapy; dementia; design; digital technology; emerging technologies; implementation; smart home technology; social robots; socially assistive technology; virtual reality,Humans; Dementia; Occupational Therapy; Caregivers; Occupational Therapists; Self-Help Devices,"Koh, WQ; Heins, P; Flynn, A; Mahmoudi Asl, A; Garcia, L; Malinowsky, C; Brorsson, A"

Explaining World-Wide Variation in Navigation Ability from Millions of People: Citizen Science Project Sea Hero Quest.,"Navigation ability varies widely across humans. Prior studies have reported that being younger and a male has an advantage for navigation ability. However, these studies have generally involved small numbers of participants from a handful of western countries. Here, we review findings from our project Sea Hero Quest, which used a video game for mobile and tablet devices to test 3.9 million people on their navigation ability, sampling across every nation-state and from 18 to 99 years of age. Results revealed that the task has good ecological validity and across all countries sufficiently sampled (N = 63), age is linked to a near-linear decline in navigation ability from the early 20s. All countries showed a male advantage, but this varied considerably and could be partly predicted by gender inequality. We found that those who reported growing up in a city were on average worse at navigating than those who grew up outside cities and that navigation performance helped identify those at greater genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease. We discuss the advantages and challenges of using a mobile app to study cognition and the future avenues for understanding individual differences in navigation ability arising from this research.",2023,Aging; Culture; Dementia; Games; Gender; Spatial cognition; Wayfinding,Humans; Male; Citizen Science; Spatial Navigation; Cognition; Individuality; Video Games,"Spiers, HJ; Coutrot, A; Hornberger, M"
Improvement in executive function for older adults through smartphone apps: a randomized clinical trial comparing language learning and brain training.,"Bilingualism has been linked to improved executive function and delayed onset of dementia, but it is unknown whether similar benefits can be obtained later in life through deliberate intervention. Given the logistical hurdles of second language acquisition in a randomized trial for older adults, few interventional studies have been done thus far. However, recently developed smartphone apps offer a convenient means to acquire skills in a second language and can be compared with brain training apps specifically designed to improve executive function. In a randomized clinical trial, 76 adults aged 65-75 were assigned to either 16 weeks of Spanish learning using the app Duolingo 30 minutes a day, an equivalent amount of brain training using the app BrainHQ, or a waitlist control condition. Executive function was assessed before and after the intervention with preregistered (NCT03638882) tests previously linked to better performance in bilinguals. For two of the primary measures: incongruent Stroop color naming and 2-back accuracy, Duolingo provided equivalent benefits as BrainHQ compared to a control group. On reaction time for N-back and Simon tests, the BrainHQ group alone experienced strong gains over the other two groups. Duolingo was rated as more enjoyable. These results suggest that app-based language learning may provide some similar benefits as brain training in improving executive function in seniors but has less impact on processing speed. However, future advancements in app design may optimize not only the acquisition of the target language but also the side benefits of the language learning experience.",2023,Bilingualism; cognitive training; dementia; executive function; language learning,Humans; Aged; Executive Function; Mobile Applications; Cognitive Training; Language; Language Development,"Meltzer, JA; Kates Rose, M; Le, AY; Spencer, KA; Goldstein, L; Gubanova, A; Lai, AC; Yossofzai, M; Armstrong, SEM; Bialystok, E"
"Developing practice standards for engaging people living with dementia in product design, testing, and commercialization - a case study.","To successfully create assistive technologies for persons with dementia, product developers must understand the capacity of people with dementia to use these technologies. Capacity assessment is typically done through user experience research. However, the published literature is bereft of guidelines to conduct optimal user experience research in samples of persons with dementia. We recruited persons with dementia from community-based organizations and private partners to participate in user experience research for an assistive technology platform. After a testing session, we used semi-structured interviews to ask participants about their involvement in the user experience process. We employed an inductive thematic approach to analyze the interview transcripts and draft guidelines to meaningfully engage persons with dementia in user experience research in the future. Ten participants with mild to moderate dementia (6 females, 4 males) participated in the study. Nine participants had previous experience with mobile devices. Thematic analysis yielded three overarching themes: 1) the techniques, approaches and attributes of the interviewer; 2) participants' views on being part of the user experience research process; and 3) specific items to optimize the research process. Resulting guidelines were divided into recommendations for the interviewer specifically, and for the broader research process.",2023,dementia; information technology; participant involvement; software application; user experience testing,"Male; Female; Humans; Dementia; Self-Help Devices; Computers, Handheld","Gilfoyle, M; Krul, J; Oremus, M"
