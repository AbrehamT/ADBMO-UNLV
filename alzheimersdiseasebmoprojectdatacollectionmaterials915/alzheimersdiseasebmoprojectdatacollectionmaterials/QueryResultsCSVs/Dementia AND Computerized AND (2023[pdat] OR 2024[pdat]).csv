A Novel Dual-Language Touch-Screen Intervention to Slow Down Cognitive Decline in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Bilingualism has been suggested to protect older adults from cognitive aging and delay the onset of dementia. However, no studies have systematically explored bilingual usage as a tool to mitigate age-related cognitive decline. We developed the Dual-Language Intervention in Semantic memory-Computerized (DISC), a novel cognitive training program with three training tasks (object categorization, verbal fluency, and utility of things) designed specifically for older adults that featured two modes: single-language (SL) exposure mode and dual-language (DL) exposure mode.",2024,Bilingualism; Cognitive intervention; Cognitively impaired; Dementia; Verbal memory,,"Yow, WQ; Sou, KL; Wong, AC"
Vision-based estimation of fatigue and engagement in cognitive training sessions.,"Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is a scalable, well-tolerated intervention that has promise for slowing cognitive decline. The effectiveness of CCT is often affected by a lack of effective engagement. Mental fatigue is a the primary factor for compromising effective engagement in CCT, particularly in older adults at risk for dementia. There is a need for scalable, automated measures that can constantly monitor and reliably detect mental fatigue during CCT. Here, we develop and validate a novel Recurrent Video Transformer (RVT) method for monitoring real-time mental fatigue in older adults with mild cognitive impairment using their video-recorded facial gestures during CCT. The RVT model achieved the highest balanced accuracy (79.58%) and precision (0.82) compared to the prior models for binary and multi-class classification of mental fatigue. We also validated our model by significantly relating to reaction time across CCT tasks (Waldχ",2024,Cognitive training; Computer vision; Disengagement; Facial gestures; Fatigue detection,,"Wang, Y; Turnbull, A; Xu, Y; Heffner, K; Lin, FV; Adeli, E"

A Novel Computerized Cognitive Test for the Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Its Association with Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Prone Brain Regions.,"During the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative changes can be identified by measuring volumetric loss in AD-prone brain regions on MRI. Cognitive assessments that are sensitive enough to measure the early brain-behavior manifestations of AD and that correlate with biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to identify and monitor individuals at risk for dementia. Weak sensitivity to early cognitive change has been a major limitation of traditional cognitive assessments. In this study, we focused on expanding our previous work by determining whether a digitized cognitive stress test, the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning, Brief Computerized Version (LASSI-BC) could differentiate between Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) groups. A second focus was to correlate LASSI-BC performance to volumetric reductions in AD-prone brain regions. Data was gathered from 111 older adults who were comprehensively evaluated and administered the LASSI-BC. Eighty-seven of these participants (51 CU; 36 aMCI) underwent MR imaging. The volumes of 12 AD-prone brain regions were related to LASSI-BC and other memory tests correcting for False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results indicated that, even after adjusting for initial learning ability, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) on the LASSI-BC differentiated between CU and aMCI groups. An optimal combination of frPSI and initial learning strength on the LASSI-BC yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.876 (76.1% sensitivity, 82.7% specificity). Further, frPSI on the LASSI-BC was associated with volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and posterior cingulate.",2023,Cortical Thickness; LASSI-L; MRI Volume; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Proactive Semantic Interference,,"Curiel Cid, RE; Zheng, DD; Kitaigorodsky, M; Adjouadi, M; Crocco, EA; Georgiou, M; Gonzalez-Jimenez, C; Ortega, A; Goryawala, M; Nagornaya, N; Pattany, P; Sfakianaki, E; Visser, U; Loewenstein, DA"

"Long-term, home-based transcranial direct current stimulation coupled with computerized cognitive training in frontotemporal dementia: A case report.","We present the case of a 62-year-old woman with probable behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) with cognitive/language deficits who demonstrated improved performance on cognitive/language testing and in functional tasks following long-term, home-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) coupled with computerized cognitive training (CCT). The patient underwent home-based tDCS (anode on the left prefrontal cortex and cathode on the right homologue) for 46 sessions over 10 weeks along with CCT. On post-treatment testing, the patient improved by 3 points on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) (23 to 26). She also showed improvement on several cognitive/language tasks, such as immediate recall of single words and word pairs, total accurate words in sentence repetition, delayed recall, semantic processing, and sentence level comprehension. There was no decline in several other cognitive and language tasks. Family members reported subjective improvements in expressiveness, communication, and interaction with others as well as increased attention to grooming and style which contrasted with her pre-treatment condition. This report suggests that home-based tDCS combined with CCT for an extended period may slow decline, and improve cognitive/language performance and everyday function in FTD.",2024,Frontotemporal dementia; behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; case report; transcranial direct current stimulation,,"Tippett, DC; Neophytou, K; Tao, Y; Gallegos, J; Morrow, C; Onyike, CU; Tsapkini, K"
Automated detection of cognitive impairment in clinical practice.,"Cognitive impairment is now recognized as an impending public health crisis. About one-third of adults are concerned about their cognition, and the prevalence of objective cognitive impairment is much higher among those with neurological disorders. Existing screening tools are narrowly focused on detecting dementia in older adults and must be clinician-administered and scored, making them impractical for many neurology practices.

Environmental pesticide exposure and Alzheimer's disease in southern Spain: A cross-sectional study.,"The intensive cultivation under plastic in southern Spain has made the agricultural model highly productive. Although strict regulations on pesticide usage exist, exposure to pesticides in the environment has been associated with an increased appearance of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A cross-sectional study was performed to examine the prevalence and risk of AD related to pesticide exposure in Andalusia (Spain). We utilized the Odds Ratio statistical test to compare the prevalence rate of AD in the exposed and unexposed areas. 40,044 cases were collected from computerized hospital records between 2000 and 2021. Districts with higher pesticide use showed significantly higher prevalence rates and increased risk of developing AD, compared to those with lower pesticide use. These findings provide further evidence supporting an increased risk of AD following environmental exposure to pesticides at the level of the general population.",2024,Alzheimer disease; Cross-sectional study; Environmental chemicals; Pesticides,"Humans; Spain; Cross-Sectional Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Pesticides; Female; Male; Environmental Exposure; Aged; Prevalence; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged","Ruiz-González, C; Román, P; Rueda-Ruzafa, L; Cardona, D; Requena, M; Alarcón, R"

Episodic memory assessment: effects of sex and age on performance and response time during a continuous recognition task.,"Continuous recognition tasks (CRTs) assess episodic memory (EM), the central functional disturbance in Alzheimer's disease and several related disorders. The online MemTrax computerized CRT provides a platform for screening and assessment that is engaging and can be repeated frequently. MemTrax presents complex visual stimuli, which require complex involvement of the lateral and medial temporal lobes and can be completed in less than 2 min. Results include number of correct recognitions (HITs), recognition failures (MISSes = 1-HITs), correct rejections (CRs), false alarms (FAs = 1-CRs), total correct (TC = HITs + CRs), and response times (RTs) for each HIT and FA. Prior analyses of MemTrax CRT data show no effects of sex but an effect of age on performance. The number of HITs corresponds to faster RT-HITs more closely than TC, and CRs do not relate to RT-HITs. RT-HITs show a typical skewed distribution, and cumulative RT-HITs fit a negative survival curve (RevEx). Thus, this study aimed to define precisely the effects of sex and age on HITS, CRs, RT-HITs, and the dynamics of RTs in an engaged population.",2024,cognitive assessment; dementia; episodic memory; memory; response time,,"Clifford, JO; Anand, S; Tarpin-Bernard, F; Bergeron, MF; Ashford, CB; Bayley, PJ; Ashford, JW"
Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD. Our new smartphone test, TapTalk, combines analysis of hand and speech-like movements to detect AD risk. This study aims to [1] determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately predict preclinical AD [2], determine usability, reliability, and validity of TapTalk in cognitively asymptomatic older adults and [3], prospectively validate TapTalk in older adults who have cognitive symptoms against cognitive tests and clinical diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Dementia; Diadochokinesis; Digital biomarker; Finger-tapping; Kinematics; Multimodal; TAS Test; TapTalk,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Alty, J; Goldberg, LR; Roccati, E; Lawler, K; Bai, Q; Huang, G; Bindoff, AD; Li, R; Wang, X; St George, RJ; Rudd, K; Bartlett, L; Collins, JM; Aiyede, M; Fernando, N; Bhagwat, A; Giffard, J; Salmon, K; McDonald, S; King, AE; Vickers, JC"

Recent Advances in the Treatment and Management of Alzheimer's Disease: A Precision Medicine Perspective.,"About 60% to 70% of people with dementia have Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a neuro-degenerative illness. One reason for this disorder is the misfolding of naturally occurring proteins in the human brain, specifically β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. Certain diagnostic imaging techniques, such as amyloid PET imaging, tau PET imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Comput-erized Tomography (CT), and others, can detect biomarkers in blood, plasma, and cerebral spinal fluids, like an increased level of β-amyloid, plaques, and tangles. In order to create new pharma-cotherapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, researchers must have a thorough and detailed knowledge of amyloid beta misfolding and other related aspects. Dolopezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are among the medications now used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Another medication that can temporarily alleviate dementia symptoms is memantine, which blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. However, it is not able to halt or re-verse the progression of the disease. Medication now on the market can only halt its advance-ment, not reverse it. Interventions to alleviate behavioral and psychological symptoms, exhibit an-ti-neuroinflammation and anti-tau effects, induce neurotransmitter alteration and cognitive en-hancement, and provide other targets have recently been developed. For some Alzheimer's pa-tients, the FDA-approved monoclonal antibody, aducanumab, is an option; for others, phase 3 clinical studies are underway for drugs, like lecanemab and donanemab, which have demonstrat-ed potential in eliminating amyloid protein. However, additional study is required to identify and address these limitations in order to reduce the likelihood of side effects and maximize the thera-peutic efficacy.",2024,Alzheimer's disease anti-tau; Clinical trials; anti-amyloid; neuroprotection; precision medicine.; tautopathy,,"Shukla, D; Suryavanshi, A; Bharti, SK; Asati, V; Mahapatra, DK"

The participants were 20 adults (aged 42-79 years) who were involved in community-based activities for dementia prevention held by a certain organization. The participants were assigned randomly to the intervention (SoroTouch) group or control group. The SoroTouch group received home-based cognitive training with SoroTouch, being asked to use the software every day for 6 months, while the control group did not receive any intervention. To investigate the effect of SoroTouch, CogEvo, a cognitive functions test battery utilizing a tablet device, was administered to all participants once per month during the 6-month intervention period. In addition, before and after the intervention, all participants were asked to take the CogEvo and the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). The analyses showed that the SoroTouch group did not improve total scores of the CogEvo and MoCA-J, but large group differences were observed in the two tasks of the CogEvo as follows: 'Follow the order' (modified Trail Making Test) at 2 months after the beginning of the intervention (group differences; 39.4, 95% confidence interval; 7.6-71.2) and 'Route 99' at 6 months (group differences; 39.6, 95% confidence interval; 4.9-74.4).

"Cholinergic changes in Lewy body disease: implications for presentation, progression and subtypes.","Cholinergic degeneration is significant in Lewy body disease, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder. Extensive research has demonstrated cholinergic alterations in the CNS of these disorders. More recently, studies have revealed cholinergic denervation in organs that receive parasympathetic denervation. This enables a comprehensive review of cholinergic changes in Lewy body disease, encompassing both central and peripheral regions, various disease stages and diagnostic categories. Across studies, brain regions affected in Lewy body dementia show equal or greater levels of cholinergic impairment compared to the brain regions affected in Lewy body disease without dementia. This observation suggests a continuum of cholinergic alterations between these disorders. Patients without dementia exhibit relative sparing of limbic regions, whereas occipital and superior temporal regions appear to be affected to a similar extent in patients with and without dementia. This implies that posterior cholinergic cell groups in the basal forebrain are affected in the early stages of Lewy body disorders, while more anterior regions are typically affected later in the disease progression. The topographical changes observed in patients affected by comorbid Alzheimer pathology may reflect a combination of changes seen in pure forms of Lewy body disease and those seen in Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that Alzheimer co-pathology is important to understand cholinergic degeneration in Lewy body disease. Thalamic cholinergic innervation is more affected in Lewy body patients with dementia compared to those without dementia, and this may contribute to the distinct clinical presentations observed in these groups. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, the thalamus is variably affected, suggesting a different sequential involvement of cholinergic cell groups in Alzheimer's disease compared to Lewy body disease. Patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder demonstrate cholinergic denervation in abdominal organs that receive parasympathetic innervation from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, similar to patients who experienced this sleep disorder in their prodrome. This implies that REM sleep behaviour disorder is important for understanding peripheral cholinergic changes in both prodromal and manifest phases of Lewy body disease. In conclusion, cholinergic changes in Lewy body disease carry implications for understanding phenotypes and the influence of Alzheimer co-pathology, delineating subtypes and pathological spreading routes, and for developing tailored treatments targeting the cholinergic system.",2024,VAChT proteins; acetylcholinesterase; cholinergic neurons; positron emission tomography; single-photon emission computerized tomography,Lewy Body Disease; Humans; Disease Progression; Cholinergic Neurons; Brain; Alzheimer Disease,"Okkels, N; Grothe, MJ; Taylor, JP; Hasselbalch, SG; Fedorova, TD; Knudsen, K; van der Zee, S; van Laar, T; Bohnen, NI; Borghammer, P; Horsager, J"

The MAPP Room Memory Test: Examining Contextual Memory Using a Novel Computerized Test in Cognitively-Unimpaired Individuals with Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease.,"Contextual memory, the ability to remember spatial or temporal features related to an event, is affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a shortfall of tests that measure contextual memory. To evaluate visuospatial contextual memory, we developed a computerized cognitive test, the MAPP Room Memory Test, which requires participants to identify in which visual scene target items were previously presented. We hypothesized that cognitively-unimpaired carriers of an autosomal dominant AD mutation (Presenilin-1 E280A, n=15) would perform more poorly on this test than non-carrier family members (n=31).

Can transcranial direct current stimulation combined with interactive computerized cognitive training boost cognition and gait performance in older adults with mild cognitive impairment? a randomized controlled trial.,"Older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are often subject to cognitive and gait deficits. Interactive Computerized Cognitive Training (ICCT) may improve cognitive function; however, the effect of such training on gait performance is limited. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) improves cognition and gait performance. It remains unclear whether combining tDCS with ICCT produces an enhanced synergistic effect on cognition and complex gait performance relative to ICCT alone. This study aimed to compare the effects of tDCS combined with ICCT on cognition and gait performance in older adults with MCI.",2024,,Humans; Aged; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Cognitive Training; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Gait; Prefrontal Cortex; Double-Blind Method,"Lau, CI; Liu, MN; Cheng, FY; Wang, HC; Walsh, V; Liao, YY"

Current trends in psychotherapies and psychosocial interventions for people with dementia: a scoping review of randomized controlled trials.,"An outcome of dementia is a progressive decline in cognitive function. Implementing psychotherapies and psychosocial interventions is crucial for bolstering cognitive abilities, promoting independence, and elevating the quality of life for individuals with dementia. This review aims to identify current trends in psychotherapies and psychosocial interventions for people with dementia. A Scoping review was developed based on the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. The literature search was conducted on electronic databases, including Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Nursing & Allied Health Collection, and MedicLatina. Executed in June 2023, the search focused on articles published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish between 2013 and 2023. Through this search, 1409 articles were initially identified. After selecting and analyzing the reports, sixteen trials were included in this review. Eight distinct categories were identified, covering different strategies. These categories run from computerized game-based cognitive training and reminiscence therapy to compensatory and restorative strategies, memory and attention training, calculation training, dual-task training, counseling, and personalized goal attainment. The findings of this scoping review highlight the diverse landscape of psychotherapies and psychosocial interventions for people with dementia.",2024,Alzheimer disease; cognition therapy; cognitive therapies; dementia; rehabilitation,,"Vicente, C; Fernandes, S; Romão, A; Fernandes, JB"
Which intellectual activities are related to cognitive reserve? Introduction and testing a three-dimensional model.,"A common belief among people and some researchers is that keeping yourself mentally active may decrease the risk of dementia. Over the past years, despite widespread efforts to identify proxies for protecting cognitive reserve against age-related changes, it is still not clear what type of intellectual activity would be beneficial for cognitive reserve. To fill this gap, we propose a three-dimensional model of intellectual activity. According to this conceptual model, intellectual activities could be distinguished based on their locations in a three-dimensions space, including; (1) Activation: active vs. passive, (2) Novelty: novel vs. familiar, and (3) Productivity: productive vs. receptive. We assumed that the activities that are categorized as more active, novel, and productive could be considered as a cognitive reserve proxy.",2024,,"Humans; Cognitive Reserve; Female; Middle Aged; Male; Aged; Memory, Short-Term; Memory, Episodic; Models, Psychological","Karsazi, H; Rezapour, T; Ghamsari, ASM; Kormi-Nouri, R; Hatami, J"
Validation of a web-based self-administered test for cognitive assessment in a Swedish geriatric setting.,"Computerized cognitive tests have the potential to cost-effectively detect and monitor cognitive impairments and thereby facilitate treatment for these conditions. However, relatively few of these tests have been validated in a variety of populations. Brain on Track, a self-administered web-based test, has previously been shown to have a good ability to differentiate between healthy individuals and patients with cognitive impairment in Portuguese populations. The objective of this study was to validate the differential ability and evaluate the usability of Brain on Track in a Swedish memory clinic setting. Brain on Track was administered to 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia and 30 healthy controls, all scheduled to perform the test from home after one week and after three months. To evaluate the usability, the patient group was interviewed after completion of the testing phase. Patients scored lower than healthy controls at both the first (median score 42.4 vs 54.1, p<0.001) and the second test (median score 42.3 vs 55.0, p<0.001). The test-retest intra-class correlation was 0.87. A multiple logistic regression model accounting for effects of age, gender and education rendered an ability of Brain on Track to differentiate between the groups with an area under the receiver operation characteristics curve of 0.90 for the first and 0.88 for the second test. In the subjective evaluation, nine patients left positive comments, nine were negative whereas five left mixed comments regarding the test experience. Sixty percent of patients had received help from relatives to log on to the platform. In conclusion, Brain on Track performed well in differentiating healthy controls from patients with cognitive impairment and showed a high test-retest reliability, on par with results from previous studies. However, the substantial proportion of patients needing help to log in could to some extent limit an independent use of the platform.",2024,,Humans; Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Sweden; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognition; Internet,"Rystedt, E; Morén, J; Lindbäck, J; Tedim Cruz, V; Ingelsson, M; Kilander, L; Lunet, N; Pais, J; Ruano, L; Westman, G"

The relationship between playing musical instruments and cognitive trajectories: Analysis from a UK ageing cohort.,"The accumulation of age-associated cognitive deficits can lead to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. This is a major public health issue for the modern ageing population, as it impairs health, independence and overall quality of life.

Intelligent digital tools for screening of brain connectivity and dementia risk estimation in people affected by mild cognitive impairment: the AI-Mind clinical study protocol.,"More than 10 million Europeans show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal brain aging and dementia stage memory disorder. The path MCI takes can be divergent; while some maintain stability or even revert to cognitive norms, alarmingly, up to half of the cases progress to dementia within 5 years. Current diagnostic practice lacks the necessary screening tools to identify those at risk of progression. The European patient experience often involves a long journey from the initial signs of MCI to the eventual diagnosis of dementia. The trajectory is far from ideal. Here, we introduce the AI-Mind project, a pioneering initiative with an innovative approach to early risk assessment through the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) on multimodal data. The cutting-edge AI-based tools developed in the project aim not only to accelerate the diagnostic process but also to deliver highly accurate predictions regarding an individual's risk of developing dementia when prevention and intervention may still be possible. AI-Mind is a European Research and Innovation Action (RIA H2020-SC1-BHC-06-2020, No. 964220) financed between 2021 and 2026.

A Review of Artificial Intelligence-Based Gait Evaluation and Rehabilitation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disease of the central nervous system that affects both motor and non-motor functions. In most cases, symptoms develop gradually, with non-motor symptoms increasing in frequency as the condition progresses. Tremors, stiffness, slow movements, and difficulty walking are some of the early symptoms. There may be problems with cognition, behavior, sleep, and thinking. Dementia caused by PD becomes more common as the disease progresses. The development of PD is linked to certain sequences of motion that eventually contribute to diminished function. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PWPD) have a sluggish, scattered gait that is accompanied by intermittent freezing of gait (FOG), in which efficient heading briefly pauses. In individuals with severe PD, FOG is a neurological deficit that is related to falls and has an unfavorable impact on the patient's standard of living. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ambient intelligence (AmI) are inextricably linked as intelligence is the ability to gain new information and employ it in novel contexts. The ambience is what accompanies us, while artificial represents something developed by humans. Wearable technologies are being designed to recognize FOG and support patients in the beginning to walk again via periodic cueing. The article proposes a unique automated approach for action description that utilizes AI to carry out a non-intrusive, markerless evaluation in real-time and with full robotics. This computerized method accelerates detection and safeguards from human error. Despite significant improvements brought about by the advent of novel technologies, the available assessment platforms still fail to strike the ideal equilibrium among expenditure, diagnostic precision, velocity, and simplicity. The value of the recommended approach can be seen through a comparison of the gait parameters collected by each of the motion-tracking gadgets.",2023,ai & robotics in healthcare; balance; gait assessment; gait training; parkinson’s disease,,"Jadhwani, PL; Harjpal, P"

Interleukin 10 (IL10) promoter region polymorphism is associated with IL10 serum concentrations and processing speed in healthy community-dwelling older adults.,"Inflammation is repressed by interleukin 10 (IL10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, and unchecked inflammation can have detrimental effects on cognition. In healthy older adults enrolled in the Australian Research Council Longevity Intervention (ARCLI) cohort we explored whether a known functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of IL10, -1082 G/A (rs1800896), was associated with reaction times on computerized cognitive testing that included elements of processing speed (i.e., reaction time). Participants were aged 60-75 years (240 females, 158 males), free of dementia and psychiatric disorders, and provide a blood sample. Processing speed was measured using the Swinburne University Computerized Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB), which includes measures of reaction time (in milliseconds, ms) on six tasks. Blood-derived DNA was genotyped for the IL10 rs1800896 SNP and presence of the APOE E4 allele. General linear models for each SUCCAB subtest were fitted, with age, sex, education (years), APOE E4 carrier status, and IL10 genotype as independent variables. Carriers of the IL10 AA genotype had significantly slower reaction times on multiple tests compared to carriers of the minor allele (AG, GG) and lower IL10 serum levels.

Examining the diagnostic value of the mnemonic discrimination task for classification of cognitive status and amyloid-beta burden.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, characterized by early memory impairments and gradual worsening of daily functions. AD-related pathology, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, begins to accumulate many years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Predicting risk for AD via related pathology is critical as the preclinical stage could serve as a therapeutic time window, allowing for early management of the disease and reducing health and economic costs. Current methods for detecting AD pathology, however, are often expensive and invasive, limiting wide and easy access to a clinical setting. A non-invasive, cost-efficient platform, such as computerized cognitive tests, could be potentially useful to identify at-risk individuals as early as possible. In this study, we examined the diagnostic value of an episodic memory task, the mnemonic discrimination task (MDT), for predicting risk of cognitive impairment or Aβ burden. We constructed a random forest classification algorithm, utilizing MDT performance metrics and various neuropsychological test scores as input features, and assessed model performance using area under the curve (AUC). Models based on MDT performance metrics achieved classification results with an AUC of 0.83 for cognitive status and an AUC of 0.64 for Aβ status. Our findings suggest that mnemonic discrimination function may be a useful predictor of progression to prodromal AD or increased risk of Aβ load, which could be a cost-efficient, noninvasive cognitive testing solution for potentially wide-scale assessment of AD pathological and cognitive risk.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-beta pathology; Mild cognitive impairment; Mnemonic discrimination tasks; Pattern separation; Random forest classification,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Episodic; Positron-Emission Tomography","Kim, S; Adams, JN; Chappel-Farley, MG; Keator, D; Janecek, J; Taylor, L; Mikhail, A; Hollearn, M; McMillan, L; Rapp, P; Yassa, MA"

The use of the integrated cognitive assessment to improve the efficiency of primary care referrals to memory services in the accelerating dementia pathway technologies study.,"Current primary care cognitive assessment tools are either crude or time-consuming instruments that can only detect cognitive impairment when it is well established. This leads to unnecessary or late referrals to memory services, by which time the disease may have already progressed into more severe stages. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some memory services have adapted to the new environment by shifting to remote assessments of patients to meet service user demand.

Dynamic Reconfiguration of Dominant Intrinsic Coupling Modes in Elderly at Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease Risk.,"Large-scale human brain networks interact across both spatial and temporal scales. Especially for electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), there are many evidences that there is a synergy of different subnetworks that oscillate on a dominant frequency within a quasi-stable brain temporal frame. Intrinsic cortical-level integration reflects the reorganization of functional brain networks that support a compensation mechanism for cognitive decline. Here, a computerized intervention integrating different functions of the medial temporal lobes, namely, object-level and scene-level representations, was conducted. One hundred fifty-eight patients with mild cognitive impairment underwent 90 min of training per day over 10 weeks. An active control (AC) group of 50 subjects was exposed to documentaries, and a passive control group of 55 subjects did not engage in any activity. Following a dynamic functional source connectivity analysis, the dynamic reconfiguration of intra- and cross-frequency coupling mechanisms before and after the intervention was revealed. After the neuropsychological and resting state electroencephalography evaluation, the ratio of inter versus intra-frequency coupling modes and also the contribution of β1 frequency was higher for the target group compared to its pre-intervention period. These frequency-dependent contributions were linked to neuropsychological estimates that were improved due to intervention. Additionally, the time-delays of the cortical interactions were improved in {δ, θ, α2, β1} compared to the pre-intervention period. Finally, dynamic networks of the target group further improved their efficiency over the total cost of the network. This is the first study that revealed a dynamic reconfiguration of intrinsic coupling modes and an improvement of time-delays due to a target intervention protocol.",2023,Cross-frequency coupling; Dynamic functional connectivity analysis; Elderly; Electroencephalography; Intervention; Intrinsic coupling modes; Multiplexity; Time-delays,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Magnetoencephalography; Electroencephalography; Brain Mapping,"Exarchos, TP; Whelan, R; Tarnanas, I"
Preoperative thalamus volume is not associated with preoperative cognitive impairment (preCI) or postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).,"A growing body of literature suggests the important role of the thalamus in cognition and neurodegenerative diseases. This study aims to elucidate whether the preoperative thalamic volume is associated with preoperative cognitive impairment (preCI) and whether it is predictive for postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 3 months (POCD). We enrolled 301 patients aged 65 or older and without signs of dementia who were undergoing elective surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted prior to surgery. Freesurfer (version 5.3.) was used to automatically segment the thalamus volume. A neuropsychological test battery was administered before surgery and at a 3 month follow-up. It included the computerized tests Paired Associate Learning (PAL), Verbal Recognition Memory (VRM), Spatial Span Length (SSP), Simple Reaction Time (SRT), the pen-and-paper Trail-Making-Test (TMT) and the manual Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). Using a reliable change index, preCI and POCD were defined as total Z-score > 1.96 (sum score over all tests) and/or Z-scores > 1.96 in ≥ 2 individual cognitive test parameters. For statistical analyses, multivariable logistic regression models were applied. Age, sex and intracranial volume were covariates in the models. Of 301 patients who received a presurgical neuropsychological testing and MRI, 34 (11.3%) had preCI. 89 patients (29.5%) were lost to follow-up. The remaining 212 patients received a follow-up cognitive test after 3 months, of whom 25 (8.3%) presented with POCD.

Investigating the relationship between periodontitis and specific memory processes in the search for cognitive markers of Alzheimer's disease risk.,"The spontaneous retrieval deficit (SRD) hypothesis argues that individuals in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are particularly impaired in spontaneous retrieval, which manifests in reduced mind-wandering. Our main purpose was to provide novel evidence to support the SRD hypothesis by investigating, for the first time, the relationship between mind-wandering and periodontitis, the latter being the risk factor for AD. The second objective was to address the lack of deeper understanding of the relationship between oral health and specific cognitive abilities by investigating whether periodontitis would be primarily associated with memory. Sixty community-dwelling dementia-free older adults completed neuropsychological tests that focused on various cognitive abilities and a computerised task, during which mind-wandering was evaluated. Periodontal health was assessed subjectively, and through an oral examination by a qualified dentist that focused on visible periodontitis-related changes in gingival tissues and the number of periodontitis bacteria. In line with our predictions, objective and subjective symptoms of poorer periodontal health were associated with less mind-wandering, providing further support for the SRD hypothesis. Again in line with predictions, poorer periodontal health was associated with worse episodic memory, with no relationship between periodontitis and the measure targeting various cognitive abilities, from which memory was excluded.",2023,,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Periodontitis; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory, Episodic","Wereszczyński, M; Śmigiel, A; Tomaszewska, I; Niedźwieńska, A"

Stumbling Blocks in the Investigation of the Relationship Between Age-Related Hearing Loss and Cognitive Impairment.,"The relationship between age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and cognitive impairment (CI) remains intricate. However, there is no robust evidence from experimental or clinical studies to elucidate their relationship. The key unaddressed questions are (a) whether there is a causal effect of ARHL on CI and (b) whether efficacious treatment of ARHL (such as hearing-aid use) ameliorates CI and dementia-related behavioral symptoms. Because of several methodological and systematic flaws/challenges, rigorous verification has not been conducted. Addressing these stumbling blocks is essential to unraveling the relationship between ARHL and CI, which motivated us to undertake this review. Here, we discuss the methodological problems from the perspectives of potential confounding bias, assessments of CI and ARHL, hearing-aid use, functional-imaging studies, and animal models based on the latest information and our experiences. We also identify potential solutions for each problem from the viewpoints of clinical epidemiology. We believe that ""objectivity,"" specifically the use of more objective behavioral assessments and new computerized technologies, may be the key to improving experimental designs for studying the relationship between ARHL and CI.",2024,age-related hearing loss; behavioral assessments; cognitive impairment; confounding bias; hearing aid; methodological flaws,Animals; Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Presbycusis; Causality; Hearing Aids,"Asakawa, T; Yang, Y; Xiao, Z; Shi, Y; Qin, W; Hong, Z; Ding, D"

Therefore, we conducted a community screening incorporating multiple simple evaluations related to dementia and frailty. In addition to various functional evaluations, we investigated interest in tests, thoughts on the disease, and the relationships between subjective (i.e., how one feels about oneself) and objective evaluations (i.e., the results of tests and rating scales). The purpose of this study was to examine the thoughts regarding tests and diseases and the functions that make it difficult to accurately perceive changes by oneself, and to obtain suggestions on the ideal method of community screening for the older adults.",2023,Cognitive function; Dementia; Frailty; Nutritional status; Olfactory function; Physical function; Screening,Humans; Aged; Frailty; Quality of Life; Cognition; Emotions; Dementia,"Kouzuki, M; Tanaka, N; Miyamoto, M; Urakami, K"

Learning capacity in early-stage Alzheimer's disease: The role of feedback during learning on memory performance.,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a decline in episodic memory and executive functioning, hampering learning ability. Insight into outcome-based learning capacity may be relevant for optimizing the learning potential of these patients. To date, mixed results have been found in studies in which cognitively impaired participants have to learn based on positive and negative outcomes. In this study, we investigated the role of negative and positive feedback on memory performance and participants' ability to adjust their behaviour accordingly in a sample of 23 early-stage AD patients and 23 matched healthy controls. We administered a novel computerized object-location memory task, in which participants were instructed to learn and memorize the locations of different everyday objects following errorless learning (EL) and trial-and-error learning (TEL). A separate probabilistic TEL task was employed in which participants had to learn how to adjust their behaviour based on positive and negative feedback. EL had a beneficial general effect on memory performance for object locations. However, this effect was not larger in early-stage AD patients compared to controls and error frequency during acquisition of object locations was unrelated to later recall performance. No group differences were found on the probabilistic learning task with respect to learning performance over time and based on positive and negative feedback. Although the error monitoring system seems intact in patients with early-stage AD, errors during learning are likely acting as a source of interference causing difficulty in storage or retrieval of object locations.",2024,error monitoring; errorless learning; spatial memory; trial-and-error learning,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Feedback; Learning; Cognition; Mental Recall,"Scheper, I; Brazil, IA; Claassen, JAHR; Bertens, D; Geurts, S; Kessels, RPC"
Clinical Evolution of Tardive Cervical Dystonia from Antecollis to Retrocollis.,"Tardive dystonia occurs after exposure, over months to years, to antipsychotics and other drugs that block dopaminergic receptors. Anterocollis is a rare form of cervical dystonia which is usually disabling for the patient. Here, we present the case of a 61-year-old woman with Alzheimer's dementia diagnosed eight years ago who was previously medicated with antipsychotics. Two years before admission, she was medicated with olanzapine. She presented to the emergency room with a sustained flexion posture of the neck that was difficult to feed. She had a marked and fixed anterocollis and severe akathisia. After the administration of propofol to perform computerized tomography, the abnormal posture disappeared. Subsequently, she was started on biperiden without improvement. One week later, olanzapine was suspended, and she was progressively started on propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and tetrabenazine. Cervical posture improved, but two weeks later, she presented with a left laterocollis, which allowed feeding, and improvement of akathisia. We present a case of tardive dystonia supported by the beginning of dystonia five months after olanzapine administration and improvement after its suspension. The coexistence of degenerative pathology is a risk factor for dystonia, which often persists despite the suspension of the causative agent. Therefore, non-pharmacological treatment and approach with antipsychotics with a better profile of extrapyramidal effects should be preferred in patients with dementia.",2023,alzheimer’s dementia; antipsychotic medication; cervical dystonia; olanzapine side effects; tardive dystonia,,"Costa, O; Varanda, S; Carneiro, G; Rodrigues, AM"

Currently, multiple studies have been adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology into these tests, evolving the conventional paper-based neurocognitive test into a digitized AI-assisted neurocognitive test. These studies provided credible evidence of the potential of AI-augmented cognitive screening tests to be better and provided the framework for future studies to further improve the implementation of AI technology in the cognitive screening test.

Digital Intervention For The Management Of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial, chronic, neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence and limited therapeutic options, making it a global health crisis. Being the most common cause of dementia, AD erodes the cognitive, functional, and social abilities of the individual and causes escalating medical and psychosocial needs. As yet, this disorder has no cure and current treatment options are palliative in nature. There is an urgent need for novel therapy to address this pressing challenge. Digital therapeutics (Dtx) is one such novel therapy that is gaining popularity globally. Dtx provides evidence based therapeutic interventions driven by internet and software, employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames, apps, sensors, virtual reality aiding in the prevention, management, and treatment of ailments like neurological abnormalities and chronic diseases. Dtx acts as a supportive tool for the optimization of patient care, individualized treatment and improved health outcomes. Dtx uses visual, sound and other non-invasive approaches for instance-consistent therapy, reminiscence therapy, computerised cognitive training, semantic and phonological assistance devices, wearables and computer-assisted rehabilitation environment to find applications in Alzheimer's disease for improving memory, cognition, functional abilities and managing motor symptom. A few of the Dtx-based tools employed in AD include ""Memory Matters"", ""AlzSense"", ""Alzheimer Assistant"", ""smart robotic dog"", ""Immersive virtual reality (iVR)"" and the most current gamma stimulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current trends in digital health in AD and explore the benefits, challenges, and impediments of using Dtx as an adjunctive therapy for the management of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Dementia; Digital health.; Internet of things; Mobile apps; Reminiscence therapy,,"Manchanda, N; Aggarwal, A; Setya, S; Talegaonkar, S"
Effect of 3D-MOT training on the execution of manual dexterity skills in a population of older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia.,"Computerized cognitive training tools are an alternative to preventive treatments related to cognitive impairment and aging. In this study, the transfer of 3D multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) training on manual dexterity concerning fine and gross motor skills in 38 elderly participants, half of them with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the other half with mild dementia (MD) was explored. A total of 36 sessions of the 3D-MOT training program were administered to the subjects. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was used to assess the baseline cognitive status of the participants. Two batteries of manual motor skills (GPT and MMDT) were applied before and after the 3D-MOT training program. The results showed an interaction effect of training and improvement in manual dexterity tests, from the first training session until the fifteenth session, and after this range of sessions, the interaction effect was lost. However, the training effect continued to the end of the thirty-six-session program. The experimental results show the effect of cognitive training on the improvement of motor skills in older adults. This type of intervention could have a broad impact on the aging population in terms of their attention, executive functions, and therefore, their quality of life.",2023,Cognitive training; manual dexterity; mild cognitive impairment; mild dementia; multiple objects tracking,,"Burgos-Morelos, LP; Rivera-Sánchez, JJ; Santana-Vargas, ÁD; Arreola-Mora, C; Chávez-Negrete, A; Lugo, JE; Faubert, J; Pérez-Pacheco, A"

Development and application of novel performance validity metrics for computerized neurocognitive batteries.,"Data from neurocognitive assessments may not be accurate in the context of factors impacting validity, such as disengagement, unmotivated responding, or intentional underperformance. Performance validity tests (PVTs) were developed to address these phenomena and assess underperformance on neurocognitive tests. However, PVTs can be burdensome, rely on cutoff scores that reduce information, do not examine potential variations in task engagement across a battery, and are typically not well-suited to acquisition of large cognitive datasets.

Applications of artificial intelligence in dementia research.,"More than 50 million older people worldwide are suffering from dementia, and this number is estimated to increase to 150 million by 2050. Greater caregiver burdens and financial impacts on the healthcare system are expected as we wait for an effective treatment for dementia. Researchers are constantly exploring new therapies and screening approaches for the early detection of dementia. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied in dementia research, including machine learning and deep learning methods for dementia diagnosis and progression detection. Computerized apps are also convenient tools for patients and caregivers to monitor cognitive function changes. Furthermore, social robots can potentially provide daily life support or guidance for the elderly who live alone. This review aims to provide an overview of AI applications in dementia research. We divided the applications into three categories according to different stages of cognitive impairment: (1) cognitive screening and training, (2) diagnosis and prognosis for dementia, and (3) dementia care and interventions. There are numerous studies on AI applications for dementia research. However, one challenge that remains is comparing the effectiveness of different AI methods in real clinical settings.",2023,AI; cognition; deep learning; dementia; machine learning,,"Tsoi, KKF; Jia, P; Dowling, NM; Titiner, JR; Wagner, M; Capuano, AW; Donohue, MC"

Subjective cognitive decline disrupts aspects of prospective memory in older adults with HIV disease.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a risk factor for dementia that may occur at higher rates in people with HIV (PWH). Prospective memory (PM) is an aspect of cognition that may help us better understand how SCD impacts daily life. Paricipants were 62 PWH aged ≥ 50 years and 33 seronegative individuals. SCD was operationalized as normatively elevated cognitive symptoms on standardized questionnaires, but with normatively unimpaired performance-based cognition and no current affective disorders. PM was measured with the Comprehensive Assessment of Prospective Memory (CAPM), the Cambridge Test of Prospective Memory (CAMPROMPT), and an experimental computerized time-based PM task. A logistic regression revealed that older PWH had a three-fold increased likelihood for SCD. Among the PWH, SCD was associated with more frequent PM symptoms and poorer accuracy on the time-based scale of the CAMPROMPT.
