Disentangling brain atrophy heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease: a deep self-supervised approach with interpretable latent space.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogeneous, but existing methods for capturing this heterogeneity through dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering have limitations when it comes to extracting intricate atrophy patterns. In this study, we propose a deep learning based self-supervised framework that characterizes complex atrophy features using latent space representation. It integrates feature engineering, classification, and clustering to synergistically disentangle heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease. Through this representation learning, we trained a clustered latent space with distinct atrophy patterns and clinical characteristics in AD, and replicated the findings in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we discovered that these clusters are not solely attributed to subtypes but also reflect disease progression in the latent space, representing the core dimensions of heterogeneity, namely progression and subtypes. Furthermore, longitudinal latent space analysis revealed two distinct disease progression pathways: medial temporal and parietotemporal pathways. The proposed approach enables effective latent representations that can be integrated with individual-level cognitive profiles, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding of AD heterogeneity.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; atrophy; deep latent representation; heterogeneity; longitudinal trajectory; self-supervised learning,,"Kang, S; Kim, SW; Seong, JK"
Fokker-Planck diffusion maps of multiple single cell microglial transcriptomes reveals radial differentiation into substates associated with Alzheimer's pathology.,"The identification of microglia subtypes is important for understanding the role of innate immunity in neurodegenerative diseases. Current methods of unsupervised cell type identification assume a small noise-to-signal ratio of transcriptome measurements that would produce well-separated cell clusters. However, identification of subtypes is obscured by gene expression noise, diminishing the distances in transcriptome space between distinct cell types and blurring boundaries. Here we use Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion maps to model cellular differentiation as a stochastic process whereby cells settle into local minima, corresponding to cell subtypes, in a potential landscape constructed from transcriptome data using a nearest neighbor graph approach. By applying critical transition fields, we identify individual cells on the verge of transitioning between subtypes, revealing microglial cells in inactivated, homeostatic state before radially transitioning into various specialized subtypes. Specifically, we show that cells from Alzheimer's disease patients are enriched in a microglia subtype associated to antigen presentation and T-cell recruitment.",2024,,,"Baumgartner, A; Robinson, M; Golde, T; Jaydev, S; Huang, S; Hadlock, J; Funk, C"
Identification and immunological characterization of genes associated with ferroptosis in Alzheimer's disease and experimental demonstration.," The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rising globally, yet its treatment and prediction of this condition remain challenging due to the complex pathophysiological mechanisms associated with it. Consequently, the objective of the present study was to analyze and characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis‑related genes (FEGs) in the pathogenesis of AD, as well as to construct a prognostic model. The findings will provide new insights for the future diagnosis and treatment of AD. First, the AD dataset GSE33000 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and the FEGs from FerrDB were obtained. Next, unsupervised cluster analysis was used to obtain the FEGs that were most relevant to AD. Subsequently, enrichment analyses were performed on the FEGs to explore biological functions. Subsequently, the role of these genes in the immune microenvironment was elucidated through CIBERSORT. Then, the optimal machine learning was selected by comparing the performance of different machine learning models. To validate the prediction efficiency, the models were validated using nomograms, calibration curves, decision curve analysis and external datasets. Furthermore, the expression of FEGs between different groups was verified using reverse transcription quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. In AD, alterations in the expression of FEGs affect the aggregation and infiltration of certain immune cells. This indicated that the occurrence of AD is strongly associated with immune infiltration. Finally, the most appropriate machine learning models were selected, and AD diagnostic models and nomograms were built. The present study provided novel insights that enhance understanding with regard to the molecular mechanism of action of FEGs in AD. Moreover, the present study provided biomarkers that may facilitate the diagnosis of AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; ferroptosis; immune infiltration; machine learning model; nomogram,"Alzheimer Disease; Ferroptosis; Humans; Machine Learning; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Biomarkers; Prognosis; Gene Expression Regulation; Computational Biology","Xiao, Z; Hu, R; Liu, WL; He, XX; Dong, MY; Huang, ZS"

Exploring approaches to tackle cross-domain challenges in brain medical image segmentation: a systematic review.,"Brain medical image segmentation is a critical task in medical image processing, playing a significant role in the prediction and diagnosis of diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and brain tumors. However, substantial distribution discrepancies among datasets from different sources arise due to the large inter-site discrepancy among different scanners, imaging protocols, and populations. This leads to cross-domain problems in practical applications. In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted to address the cross-domain problem in brain image segmentation.",2024,brain medical image; brain tumor; cross-domain; normalization; segmentation; stroke; white matter,,"Yanzhen, M; Song, C; Wanping, L; Zufang, Y; Wang, A"
Interpretable deep clustering survival machines for Alzheimer's disease subtype discovery.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that has impacted millions of people worldwide. The neuroanatomical heterogeneity of AD has made it challenging to fully understand the disease mechanism. Identifying AD subtypes during the prodromal stage and determining their genetic basis would be immensely valuable for drug discovery and subsequent clinical treatment. Previous studies that clustered subgroups typically used unsupervised learning techniques, neglecting the survival information and potentially limiting the insights gained. To address this problem, we propose an interpretable survival analysis method called Deep Clustering Survival Machines (DCSM), which combines both discriminative and generative mechanisms. Similar to mixture models, we assume that the timing information of survival data can be generatively described by a mixture of parametric distributions, referred to as expert distributions. We learn the weights of these expert distributions for individual instances in a discriminative manner by leveraging their features. This allows us to characterize the survival information of each instance through a weighted combination of the learned expert distributions. We demonstrate the superiority of the DCSM method by applying this approach to cluster patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into subgroups with different risks of converting to AD. Conventional clustering measurements for survival analysis along with genetic association studies successfully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and characterize our clustering findings.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Interpretability; Subtype discovery; Survival analysis,,"Hou, B; Wen, Z; Bao, J; Zhang, R; Tong, B; Yang, S; Wen, J; Cui, Y; Moore, JH; Saykin, AJ; Huang, H; Thompson, PM; Ritchie, MD; Davatzikos, C; Shen, L"
CoVAMPnet: Comparative Markov State Analysis for Studying Effects of Drug Candidates on Disordered Biomolecules.,"Computational study of the effect of drug candidates on intrinsically disordered biomolecules is challenging due to their vast and complex conformational space. Here, we developed a comparative Markov state analysis (CoVAMPnet) framework to quantify changes in the conformational distribution and dynamics of a disordered biomolecule in the presence and absence of small organic drug candidate molecules. First, molecular dynamics trajectories are generated using enhanced sampling, in the presence and absence of small molecule drug candidates, and ensembles of soft Markov state models (MSMs) are learned for each system using unsupervised machine learning. Second, these ensembles of learned MSMs are aligned across different systems based on a solution to an optimal transport problem. Third, the directional importance of inter-residue distances for the assignment to different conformational states is assessed by a discriminative analysis of aggregated neural network gradients. This final step provides interpretability and biophysical context to the learned MSMs. We applied this novel computational framework to assess the effects of ongoing phase 3 therapeutics tramiprosate (TMP) and its metabolite 3-sulfopropanoic acid (SPA) on the disordered Aβ42 peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease. Based on adaptive sampling molecular dynamics and CoVAMPnet analysis, we observed that both TMP and SPA preserved more structured conformations of Aβ42 by interacting nonspecifically with charged residues. SPA impacted Aβ42 more than TMP, protecting α-helices and suppressing the formation of aggregation-prone β-strands. Experimental biophysical analyses showed only mild effects of TMP/SPA on Aβ42 and activity enhancement by the endogenous metabolization of TMP into SPA. Our data suggest that TMP/SPA may also target biomolecules other than Aβ peptides. The CoVAMPnet method is broadly applicable to study the effects of drug candidates on the conformational behavior of intrinsically disordered biomolecules.",2024,,,"Marques, SM; Kouba, P; Legrand, A; Sedlar, J; Disson, L; Planas-Iglesias, J; Sanusi, Z; Kunka, A; Damborsky, J; Pajdla, T; Prokop, Z; Mazurenko, S; Sivic, J; Bednar, D"
Artificial intelligence classifies primary progressive aphasia from connected speech.,"Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best divided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this cross-sectional study, we first harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform unsupervised classification of short, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Large Language Models (LLMs) discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. In the subsequent supervised classification, seventeen distinctive features emerged, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of short, connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in classifying the four groups (three PPA variants and healthy controls). The data-driven section of this study showcases the ability of LLMs to find natural partitioning in the speech of patients with PPA consistent with conventional variants. In addition, the work identifies a robust set of language features indicative of each PPA variant, emphasizing the significance of dividing verbs into high and low-frequency categories. Beyond improving diagnostic accuracy, these findings enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of language processing.",2024,data-driven classification; generative artificial intelligence; primary progressive aphasia (PPA); theory-driven classification; verb frequency,,"Rezaii, N; Hochberg, D; Quimby, M; Wong, B; Brickhouse, M; Touroutoglou, A; Dickerson, BC; Wolff, P"

AI-based mining of biomedical literature: Applications for drug repurposing for the treatment of dementia.,"Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and others significantly affect individuals, their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. While there are no cures yet, researchers worldwide are actively working on the development of novel treatments that have the potential to slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and ultimately improve the overall health of patients. Huge volumes of new scientific information necessitate new analytical approaches for meaningful hypothesis generation. To enable the automatic analysis of biomedical data we introduced AGATHA, an effective AI-based literature mining tool that can navigate massive scientific literature databases, such as PubMed. The overarching goal of this effort is to adapt AGATHA for drug repurposing by revealing hidden connections between FDA-approved medications and a health condition of interest. Our tool converts the abstracts of peer-reviewed papers from PubMed into multidimensional space where each gene and health condition are represented by specific metrics. We implemented advanced statistical analysis to reveal distinct clusters of scientific terms within the virtual space created using AGATHA-calculated parameters for selected health conditions and genes. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was employed for categorizing and predicting samples (122 diseases and 20889 genes) fitted to specific classes. Advanced statistics were employed to build a discrimination model and extract lists of genes specific to each disease class. Here we focus on drugs that can be repurposed for dementia treatment as an outcome of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we determined dementia-associated genes statistically highly ranked in other disease classes. Additionally, we report a mechanism for detecting genes common to multiple health conditions. These sets of genes were classified based on their presence in biological pathways, aiding in selecting candidates and biological processes that are exploitable with drug repurposing.",2024,,,"Sikirzhytskaya, A; Tyagin, I; Sutton, SS; Wyatt, MD; Safro, I; Shtutman, M"
Combining supervised and unsupervised analyses to quantify behavioral phenotypes and validate therapeutic efficacy in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Behavioral testing is an essential tool for evaluating cognitive function and dysfunction in preclinical research models. This is of special importance in the study of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the reproducibility of classic behavioral assays is frequently compromised by interstudy variation, leading to ambiguous conclusions about the behavioral markers characterizing the disease. Here, we identify age- and genotype-driven differences between 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic control mice using a low-cost, highly customizable behavioral assay that requires little human intervention. Through behavioral phenotyping combining both supervised and unsupervised behavioral classification methods, we are able to validate the preventative effects of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A in a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the partially ameliorating effects of candidate drugs nebivolol and cabozantinib.",2024,,,"Del Rosario Hernandez, T; Joshi, NR; Gore, SV; Kreiling, JA; Creton, R"

Differential responses of primary neuron-secreted MCP-1 and IL-9 to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease-associated metabolites.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is implicated as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. In this work, we investigated neuroinflammatory responses of primary neurons to potentially circulating, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable metabolites associated with AD, T2D, or both. We identified nine metabolites associated with protective or detrimental properties of AD and T2D in literature (lauric acid, asparagine, fructose, arachidonic acid, aminoadipic acid, sorbitol, retinol, tryptophan, niacinamide) and stimulated primary mouse neuron cultures with each metabolite before quantifying cytokine secretion via Luminex. We employed unsupervised clustering, inferential statistics, and partial least squares discriminant analysis to identify relationships between cytokine concentration and disease-associations of metabolites. We identified MCP-1, a cytokine associated with monocyte recruitment, as differentially abundant between neurons stimulated by metabolites associated with protective and detrimental properties of AD and T2D. We also identified IL-9, a cytokine that promotes mast cell growth, to be differentially associated with T2D. Indeed, cytokines, such as MCP-1 and IL-9, released from neurons in response to BBB-permeable metabolites associated with T2D may contribute to AD development by downstream effects of neuroinflammation.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Mice; Neurons; Chemokine CCL2; Interleukin-9; Blood-Brain Barrier; Cells, Cultured","Ball, BK; Kuhn, MK; Fleeman Bechtel, RM; Proctor, EA; Brubaker, DK"

DeepFDR: A Deep Learning-based False Discovery Rate Control Method for Neuroimaging Data.,"Voxel-based multiple testing is widely used in neuroimaging data analysis. Traditional false discovery rate (FDR) control methods often ignore the spatial dependence among the voxel-based tests and thus suffer from substantial loss of testing power. While recent spatial FDR control methods have emerged, their validity and optimality remain questionable when handling the complex spatial dependencies of the brain. Concurrently, deep learning methods have revolutionized image segmentation, a task closely related to voxel-based multiple testing. In this paper, we propose DeepFDR, a novel spatial FDR control method that leverages unsupervised deep learning-based image segmentation to address the voxel-based multiple testing problem. Numerical studies, including comprehensive simulations and Alzheimer's disease FDG-PET image analysis, demonstrate DeepFDR's superiority over existing methods. DeepFDR not only excels in FDR control and effectively diminishes the false nondiscovery rate, but also boasts exceptional computational efficiency highly suited for tackling large-scale neuroimaging data.",2024,,,"Kim, T; Shu, H; Jia, Q; de Leon, MJ"
Unsupervised multimodal modeling of cognitive and brain health trajectories for early dementia prediction.,"Predicting the course of neurodegenerative disorders early has potential to greatly improve clinical management and patient outcomes. A key challenge for early prediction in real-world clinical settings is the lack of labeled data (i.e., clinical diagnosis). In contrast to supervised classification approaches that require labeled data, we propose an unsupervised multimodal trajectory modeling (MTM) approach based on a mixture of state space models that captures changes in longitudinal data (i.e., trajectories) and stratifies individuals without using clinical diagnosis for model training. MTM learns the relationship between states comprising expensive, invasive biomarkers (β-amyloid, grey matter density) and readily obtainable cognitive observations. MTM training on trajectories stratifies individuals into clinically meaningful clusters more reliably than MTM training on baseline data alone and is robust to missing data (i.e., cognitive data alone or single assessments). Extracting an individualized cognitive health index (i.e., MTM-derived cluster membership index) allows us to predict progression to AD more precisely than standard clinical assessments (i.e., cognitive tests or MRI scans alone). Importantly, MTM generalizes successfully from research cohort to real-world clinical data from memory clinic patients with missing data, enhancing the clinical utility of our approach. Thus, our multimodal trajectory modeling approach provides a cost-effective and non-invasive tool for early dementia prediction without labeled data (i.e., clinical diagnosis) with strong potential for translation to clinical practice.",2024,,"Humans; Male; Female; Dementia; Brain; Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognition; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Burkhart, MC; Lee, LY; Vaghari, D; Toh, AQ; Chong, E; Chen, C; Tiňo, P; Kourtzi, Z"
Harmonizing three-dimensional MRI using pseudo-warping field guided GAN.,"In pursuit of cultivating automated models for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to aid in diagnostics, an escalating demand for extensive, multisite, and heterogeneous brain imaging datasets has emerged. This potentially introduces biased outcomes when directly applied for subsequent analysis. Researchers have endeavored to address this issue by pursuing the harmonization of MRIs. However, most existing image-based harmonization methods for MRI are tailored for 2D slices, which may introduce inter-slice variations when they are combined into a 3D volume. In this study, we aim to resolve inconsistencies between slices by introducing a pseudo-warping field. This field is created randomly and utilized to transform a slice into an artificially warped subsequent slice. The objective of this pseudo-warping field is to ensure that generators can consistently harmonize adjacent slices to another domain, without being affected by the varying content present in different slices. Furthermore, we construct unsupervised spatial and recycle loss to enhance the spatial accuracy and slice-wise consistency across the 3D images. The results demonstrate that our model effectively mitigates inter-slice variations and successfully preserves the anatomical details of the images during the harmonization process. Compared to generative harmonization models that employ 3D operators, our model exhibits greater computational efficiency and flexibility.",2024,Brain MRI; GAN; Pseudo-warping field; Slice-wise 3D MRI harmonization,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Brain; Algorithms; Neuroimaging","Lin, J; Li, Z; Zeng, Y; Liu, X; Li, L; Jahanshad, N; Ge, X; Zhang, D; Lu, M; Liu, M"
Brainomaly: Unsupervised Neurologic Disease Detection Utilizing Unannotated T1-weighted Brain MR Images.,"Harnessing the power of deep neural networks in the medical imaging domain is challenging due to the difficulties in acquiring large annotated datasets, especially for rare diseases, which involve high costs, time, and effort for annotation. Unsupervised disease detection methods, such as anomaly detection, can significantly reduce human effort in these scenarios. While anomaly detection typically focuses on learning from images of healthy subjects only, real-world situations often present unannotated datasets with a mixture of healthy and diseased subjects. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing such unannotated images can improve unsupervised disease and anomaly detection. However, these methods do not utilize knowledge specific to registered neuroimages, resulting in a subpar performance in neurologic disease detection. To address this limitation, we propose Brainomaly, a GAN-based image-to-image translation method specifically designed for neurologic disease detection. Brainomaly not only offers tailored image-to-image translation suitable for neuroimages but also leverages unannotated mixed images to achieve superior neurologic disease detection. Additionally, we address the issue of model selection for inference without annotated samples by proposing a pseudo-AUC metric, further enhancing Brainomaly's detection performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Brainomaly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised disease and anomaly detection methods by significant margins in Alzheimer's disease detection using a publicly available dataset and headache detection using an institutional dataset.

Mixture of regressions with multivariate responses for discovering subtypes in Alzheimer's biomarkers with detection limits.,"There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), except from autopsies, which motivates the use of unsupervised learning. A mixture of regressions is an unsupervised method that can simultaneously identify clusters from multiple biomarkers while learning within-cluster demographic effects. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD have detection limits, which create additional challenges. We apply a mixture of regressions with a multivariate truncated Gaussian distribution (also called a censored multivariate Gaussian mixture of regressions or a mixture of multivariate tobit regressions) to over 3,000 participants from the Emory Goizueta Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Emory Healthy Brain Study to examine amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42), total tau protein and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF with known detection limits. We address three gaps in the literature on mixture of regressions with a truncated multivariate Gaussian distribution: software availability; inference; and clustering accuracy. We discovered three clusters that tend to align with an AD group, a normal control profile and non-AD pathology. The CSF profiles differed by race, gender and the genetic marker ApoE4, highlighting the importance of considering demographic factors in unsupervised learning with detection limits. Notably, African American participants in the AD-like group had significantly lower tau burden.",2024,Alzheimer’s Disease; Censored Gaussian mixture of regressions; Clustering; Finite mixture model; Latent Class Analysis; Tobit model; Truncated normal; Unsupervised learning,,"Tian, G; Hanfelt, J; Lah, J; Risk, BB"
Multi-Task Learning and Sparse Discriminant Canonical Correlation Analysis for Identification of Diagnosis-Specific Genotype-Phenotype Association.,"The primary objective of imaging genetics research is to investigate the complex genotype-phenotype association for the disease under study. For example, to understand the impact of genetic variations over the brain functions and structure, the genotypic data such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is integrated with the phenotypic data such as imaging quantitative traits. The sparse models, based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA), are popular in this area to find the complex bi-multivariate genotype-phenotype association, as the number of features in genotypic and/or phenotypic data is significantly higher as compared to the number of samples. However, the sparse CCA based methods are, in general, unsupervised in nature, and fail to identify the diagnose-specific features those play an important role for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease under study. In this regard, a new supervised model is proposed to study the complex genotype-phenotype association, by judiciously integrating the merits of CCA, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and multi-task learning. The proposed model can identify the diagnose-specific as well as the diagnose-consistent features with significantly lower computational complexity. The performance of the proposed method, along with a comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, is evaluated on several synthetic data sets and one real imaging genetics data collected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. In the current study, the SNP as genetic data and resting state functional MRI ( fMRI) as imaging data are integrated to find the complex genotype-phenotype association. An important finding is that the proposed method has better correlation value, improved noise resistance and stability, and also has better feature selection ability. All the results illustrate the power and capability of the proposed method to find the diagnostic group-specific imaging genetic association, which may help to understand the neurodegenerative disorder in a more comprehensive way.",2024,,,"Mondal, S; Maji, P"
Data-driven normative values based on generative manifold learning for quantitative MRI.,"In medicine, abnormalities in quantitative metrics such as the volume reduction of one brain region of an individual versus a control group are often provided as deviations from so-called normal values. These normative reference values are traditionally calculated based on the quantitative values from a control group, which can be adjusted for relevant clinical co-variables, such as age or sex. However, these average normative values do not take into account the globality of the available quantitative information. For example, quantitative analysis of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images based on anatomical structure segmentation frequently includes over 100 cerebral structures in the quantitative reports, and these tend to be analyzed separately. In this study, we propose a global approach to personalized normative values for each brain structure using an unsupervised Artificial Intelligence technique known as generative manifold learning. We test the potential benefit of these personalized normative values in comparison with the more traditional average normative values on a population of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy operated for focal cortical dysplasia, as well as on a supplementary healthy group and on patients with Alzheimer's disease.",2024,,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Learning; Alzheimer Disease,"Attyé, A; Renard, F; Anglade, V; Krainik, A; Kahane, P; Mansencal, B; Coupé, P; Calamante, F"
A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"

Diagnosis-Guided Deep Subspace Clustering Association Study for Pathogenetic Markers Identification of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Comparative Atlases.,"The roles of brain region activities and genotypic functions in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. Meanwhile, current imaging genetics methods are difficult to identify potential pathogenetic markers by correlation analysis between brain network and genetic variation. To discover disease-related brain connectome from the specific brain structure and the fine-grained level, based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and human Brainnetome atlases, the functional brain network is first constructed for each subject. Specifically, the upper triangle elements of the functional connectivity matrix are extracted as connectivity features. The clustering coefficient and the average weighted node degree are developed to assess the significance of every brain area. Since the constructed brain network and genetic data are characterized by non-linearity, high-dimensionality, and few subjects, the deep subspace clustering algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the original data. Our multilayer neural network helps capture the non-linear manifolds, and subspace clustering learns pairwise affinities between samples. Moreover, most approaches in neuroimaging genetics are unsupervised learning, neglecting the diagnostic information related to diseases. We presented a label constraint with diagnostic status to instruct the imaging genetics correlation analysis. To this end, a diagnosis-guided deep subspace clustering association (DDSCA) method is developed to discover brain connectome and risk genetic factors by integrating genotypes with functional network phenotypes. Extensive experiments prove that DDSCA achieves superior performance to most association methods and effectively selects disease-relevant genetic markers and brain connectome at the coarse-grained and fine-grained levels.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cluster Analysis; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Connectome; Algorithms; Aged; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Atlases as Topic; Neuroimaging,"Jiao, CN; Shang, J; Li, F; Cui, X; Wang, YL; Gao, YL; Liu, JX"

Waveform-based classification of dentate spikes.,"Synchronous excitatory discharges from the entorhinal cortex (EC) to the dentate gyrus (DG) generate fast and prominent patterns in the hilar local field potential (LFP), called dentate spikes (DSs). As sharp-wave ripples in CA1, DSs are more likely to occur in quiet behavioral states, when memory consolidation is thought to take place. However, their functions in mnemonic processes are yet to be elucidated. The classification of DSs into types 1 or 2 is determined by their origin in the lateral or medial EC, as revealed by current source density (CSD) analysis, which requires recordings from linear probes with multiple electrodes spanning the DG layers. To allow the investigation of the functional role of each DS type in recordings obtained from single electrodes and tetrodes, which are abundant in the field, we developed an unsupervised method using Gaussian mixture models to classify such events based on their waveforms. Our classification approach achieved high accuracies (> 80%) when validated in 8 mice with DG laminar profiles. The average CSDs, waveforms, rates, and widths of the DS types obtained through our method closely resembled those derived from the CSD-based classification. As an example of application, we used the technique to analyze single-electrode LFPs from apolipoprotein (apo) E3 and apoE4 knock-in mice. We observed that the latter group, which is a model for Alzheimer's disease, exhibited wider DSs of both types from a young age, with a larger effect size for DS type 2, likely reflecting early pathophysiological alterations in the EC-DG network, such as hyperactivity. In addition to the applicability of the method in expanding the study of DS types, our results show that their waveforms carry information about their origins, suggesting different underlying network dynamics and roles in memory processing.",2024,,Mice; Animals; Entorhinal Cortex; Electrodes; Memory Consolidation; Dentate Gyrus; Hippocampus,"Santiago, RMM; Lopes-Dos-Santos, V; Aery Jones, EA; Huang, Y; Dupret, D; Tort, ABL"
Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.,"Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic 'bioenergetic capacity' as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.",2024,,,"Arnold, M; Buyukozkan, M; Doraiswamy, PM; Nho, K; Wu, T; Gudnason, V; Launer, LJ; Wang-Sattler, R; Adamski, J; De Jager, PL; Ertekin-Taner, N; Bennett, DA; Saykin, AJ; Peters, A; Suhre, K; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Kastenmüller, G; Krumsiek, J"

Using Generative Artificial Intelligence to Classify Primary Progressive Aphasia from Connected Speech.,"Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.",2023,,,"Rezaii, N; Quimby, M; Wong, B; Hochberg, D; Brickhouse, M; Touroutoglou, A; Dickerson, BC; Wolff, P"

Single-cell sequencing analysis within biologically relevant dimensions.,"The currently predominant approach to transcriptomic and epigenomic single-cell analysis depends on a rigid perspective constrained by reduced dimensions and algorithmically derived and annotated clusters. Here, we developed Seqtometry (sequencing-to-measurement), a single-cell analytical strategy based on biologically relevant dimensions enabled by advanced scoring with multiple gene sets (signatures) for examination of gene expression and accessibility across various organ systems. By utilizing information only in the form of specific signatures, Seqtometry bypasses unsupervised clustering and individual annotations of clusters. Instead, Seqtometry combines qualitative and quantitative cell-type identification with specific characterization of diverse biological processes under experimental or disease conditions. Comprehensive analysis by Seqtometry of various immune cells as well as other cells from different organs and disease-induced states, including multiple myeloma and Alzheimer's disease, surpasses corresponding cluster-based analytical output. We propose Seqtometry as a single-cell sequencing analysis approach applicable for both basic and clinical research.",2024,cancer; gene signatures; immune cells; metabolism; scATAC-seq; scRNA-seq; scoring; single-cell sequencing analysis; stemness,"Sequence Analysis, RNA; Gene Expression Profiling; Transcriptome; Single-Cell Analysis; Cluster Analysis","Kousnetsov, R; Bourque, J; Surnov, A; Fallahee, I; Hawiger, D"
Enabling Lipidomic Biomarker Studies for Protected Populations by Combining Noninvasive Fingerprint Sampling with MS Analysis and Machine Learning.,"Triacylglycerols and wax esters are two lipid classes that have been linked to diseases, including autism, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, cardiovascular disease, dry eye disease, and diabetes, and thus are molecules worthy of biomarker exploration studies. Since triacylglycerols and wax esters make up the majority of skin-surface lipid secretions, a viable sampling method for these potential biomarkers would be that of groomed latent fingerprints. Currently, however, blood-based sampling protocols predominate in the field. The invasiveness of a blood draw limits its utility to protected populations, including children and the elderly. Herein we describe a noninvasive means for sample collection (from fingerprints) paired with fast MS data-acquisition (MassIVE data set MSV000092742) and efficient data analysis via machine learning. Using both supervised and unsupervised classification, we demonstrate the usefulness of this method in determining whether a variable of interest imparts measurable change within the lipidomic data set. As a proof-of-concept, we show that the method is capable of distinguishing between the fingerprints of different individuals as well as between anatomical sebum collection regions. This noninvasive, high-throughput approach enables future lipidomic biomarker researchers to more easily include underrepresented, protected populations, such as children and the elderly, thus moving the field closer to definitive disease diagnoses that apply to all.",2024,biomarkers; fingerprints; lipidomics; lipids; machine learning; mass spectrometry; noninvasive sampling,,"Isom, M; Go, EP; Desaire, H"
Analyzing risk factors for post-acute recovery in older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia: A new semi-parametric model for large-scale medicare claims.,"Nearly 300,000 older adults experience a hip fracture every year, the majority of which occur following a fall. Unfortunately, recovery after fall-related trauma such as hip fracture is poor, where older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) spend a particularly long time in hospitals or rehabilitation facilities during the post-operative recuperation period. Because older adults value functional recovery and spending time at home versus facilities as key outcomes after hospitalization, identifying factors that influence days spent at home after hospitalization is imperative. While several individual-level factors have been identified, the characteristics of the treating hospital have recently been identified as contributors. However, few methodological rigorous approaches are available to help overcome potential sources of bias such as hospital-level unmeasured confounders, informative hospital size, and loss to follow-up due to death. This article develops a useful tool equipped with unsupervised learning to simultaneously handle statistical complexities that are often encountered in health services research, especially when using large administrative claims databases. The proposed estimator has a closed form, thus only requiring light computation load in a large-scale study. We further develop its asymptotic properties with stabilized inference assisted by unsupervised clustering. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate superiority of the proposed estimator compared to existing estimators.",2024,dementia; post-discharge outcome; profile least square; propensity score weighting; unsupervised learning,Humans; Aged; United States; Alzheimer Disease; Medicare; Hospitalization; Risk Factors; Physical Therapy Modalities; Retrospective Studies,"Shen, B; Ren, H; Shardell, M; Falvey, J; Chen, C"
Self-supervised multimodal learning for group inferences from MRI data: Discovering disorder-relevant brain regions and multimodal links.,"In recent years, deep learning approaches have gained significant attention in predicting brain disorders using neuroimaging data. However, conventional methods often rely on single-modality data and supervised models, which provide only a limited perspective of the intricacies of the highly complex brain. Moreover, the scarcity of accurate diagnostic labels in clinical settings hinders the applicability of the supervised models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for extracting multiple representations from multimodal neuroimaging data to enhance group inferences and enable analysis without resorting to labeled data during pre-training. Our approach leverages Deep InfoMax (DIM), a self-supervised methodology renowned for its efficacy in learning representations by estimating mutual information without the need for explicit labels. While DIM has shown promise in predicting brain disorders from single-modality MRI data, its potential for multimodal data remains untapped. This work extends DIM to multimodal neuroimaging data, allowing us to identify disorder-relevant brain regions and explore multimodal links. We present compelling evidence of the efficacy of our multimodal DIM analysis in uncovering disorder-relevant brain regions, including the hippocampus, caudate, insula, - and multimodal links with the thalamus, precuneus, and subthalamus hypothalamus. Our self-supervised representations demonstrate promising capabilities in predicting the presence of brain disorders across a spectrum of Alzheimer's phenotypes. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art unsupervised methods based on autoencoders, canonical correlation analysis, and supervised models highlight the superiority of our proposed method in achieving improved classification performance, capturing joint information, and interpretability capabilities. The computational efficiency of the decoder-free strategy enhances its practical utility, as it saves compute resources without compromising performance. This work offers a significant step forward in addressing the challenge of understanding multimodal links in complex brain disorders, with potential applications in neuroimaging research and clinical diagnosis.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Deep learning; Multimodal data; Mutual information; Self-supervised learning,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain; Brain Diseases; Multimodal Imaging,"Fedorov, A; Geenjaar, E; Wu, L; Sylvain, T; DeRamus, TP; Luck, M; Misiura, M; Mittapalle, G; Hjelm, RD; Plis, SM; Calhoun, VD"

Differential responses of primary neuron-secreted MCP-1 and IL-9 to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease-associated metabolites.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is implicated as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. In this work, we investigated neuroinflammatory responses of primary neurons to potentially circulating, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable metabolites associated with AD, T2D, or both. We identified nine metabolites associated with protective or detrimental properties of AD and T2D in literature (lauric acid, asparagine, fructose, arachidonic acid, aminoadipic acid, sorbitol, retinol, tryptophan, niacinamide) and stimulated primary mouse neuron cultures with each metabolite before quantifying cytokine secretion via Luminex. We employed unsupervised clustering, inferential statistics, and partial least squares discriminant analysis to identify relationships between cytokine concentration and disease-associations of metabolites. We identified MCP-1, a cytokine associated with monocyte recruitment, as differentially abundant between neurons stimulated by metabolites associated with protective and detrimental properties of AD and T2D. We also identified IL-9, a cytokine that promotes mast cell growth, to be differentially associated with T2D. Indeed, cytokines, such as MCP-1 and IL-9, released from neurons in response to BBB-permeable metabolites associated with T2D may contribute to AD development by downstream effects of neuroinflammation.",2023,,,"Ball, BK; Kuhn, MK; Fleeman, RM; Proctor, EA; Brubaker, DK"
An efficient semi-supervised quality control system trained using physics-based MRI-artefact generators and adversarial training.,"Large medical imaging data sets are becoming increasingly available. A common challenge in these data sets is to ensure that each sample meets minimum quality requirements devoid of significant artefacts. Despite a wide range of existing automatic methods having been developed to identify imperfections and artefacts in medical imaging, they mostly rely on data-hungry methods. In particular, the scarcity of artefact-containing scans available for training has been a major obstacle in the development and implementation of machine learning in clinical research. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework having four main components: (1) a set of artefact generators inspired by magnetic resonance physics to corrupt brain MRI scans and augment a training dataset, (2) a set of abstract and engineered features to represent images compactly, (3) a feature selection process that depends on the class of artefact to improve classification performance, and (4) a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained to identify artefacts. Our novel contributions are threefold: first, we use the novel physics-based artefact generators to generate synthetic brain MRI scans with controlled artefacts as a data augmentation technique. This will avoid the labour-intensive collection and labelling process of scans with rare artefacts. Second, we propose a large pool of abstract and engineered image features developed to identify 9 different artefacts for structural MRI. Finally, we use an artefact-based feature selection block that, for each class of artefacts, finds the set of features that provide the best classification performance. We performed validation experiments on a large data set of scans with artificially-generated artefacts, and in a multiple sclerosis clinical trial where real artefacts were identified by experts, showing that the proposed pipeline outperforms traditional methods. In particular, our data augmentation increases performance by up to 12.5 percentage points on the accuracy, F1, F2, precision and recall. At the same time, the computation cost of our pipeline remains low - less than a second to process a single scan - with the potential for real-time deployment. Our artefact simulators obtained using adversarial learning enable the training of a quality control system for brain MRI that otherwise would have required a much larger number of scans in both supervised and unsupervised settings. We believe that systems for quality control will enable a wide range of high-throughput clinical applications based on the use of automatic image-processing pipelines.",2024,Adversarial training; Artefacts generation; Brain; MRI; Quality control; Real-time processing; Synthetic-images,"Humans; Artifacts; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neuroimaging; Machine Learning","Ravi, D; Barkhof, F; Alexander, DC; Puglisi, L; Parker, GJM; Eshaghi, A"
Joint learning framework of cross-modal synthesis and diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease by mining underlying shared modality information.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders presenting irreversible progression of cognitive impairment. How to identify AD as early as possible is critical for intervention with potential preventive measures. Among various neuroimaging modalities used to diagnose AD, functional positron emission tomography (PET) has higher sensitivity than structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but it is also costlier and often not available in many hospitals. How to leverage massive unpaired unlabeled PET to improve the diagnosis performance of AD from MRI becomes rather important. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel joint learning framework of unsupervised cross-modal synthesis and AD diagnosis by mining underlying shared modality information, improving the AD diagnosis from MRI while synthesizing more discriminative PET images. We mine underlying shared modality information in two aspects: diversifying modality information through the cross-modal synthesis network and locating critical diagnosis-related patterns through the AD diagnosis network. First, to diversify the modality information, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal synthesis network, which implements the inter-conversion between 3D PET and MRI in a single model modulated by the AdaIN module. Second, to locate shared critical diagnosis-related patterns, we propose an interpretable diagnosis network based on fully 2D convolutions, which takes either 3D synthesized PET or original MRI as input. Extensive experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that our framework can synthesize more realistic images, outperform the state-of-the-art AD diagnosis methods, and have better generalization on external AIBL and NACC datasets.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis; Cross-modal synthesis; Joint learning; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Positron emission tomography (PET),Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Learning; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Wang, C; Piao, S; Huang, Z; Gao, Q; Zhang, J; Li, Y; Shan, H"
SaLSa: A Combinatory Approach of Semi-Automatic Labeling and Long Short-Term Memory to Classify Behavioral Syllables.,"Accurately and quantitatively describing mouse behavior is an important area. Although advances in machine learning have made it possible to track their behaviors accurately, reliable classification of behavioral sequences or syllables remains a challenge. In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach, called SaLSa (a combination of semi-automatic labeling and long short-term memory-based classification), to classify behavioral syllables of mice exploring an open field. This approach consists of two major steps. First, after tracking multiple body parts, spatial and temporal features of their egocentric coordinates are extracted. A fully automated unsupervised process identifies candidates for behavioral syllables, followed by manual labeling of behavioral syllables using a graphical user interface (GUI). Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier is trained with the labeled data. We found that the classification performance was marked over 97%. It provides a performance equivalent to a state-of-the-art model while classifying some of the syllables. We applied this approach to examine how hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease develops with age. When the proportion of each behavioral syllable was compared between genotypes and sexes, we found that the characteristic hyperlocomotion of female Alzheimer's disease mice emerges between four and eight months. In contrast, age-related reduction in rearing is common regardless of genotype and sex. Overall, SaLSa enables detailed characterization of mouse behavior.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aging; classification; computational ethology; deep learning; long short-term memory,"Mice; Female; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Memory, Short-Term; Memory, Long-Term","Sakata, S"

A Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation Framework for 3D MRI Classification of Gliomas and Alzheimer's Diseases.,"Accurate and fully automated brain structure examination and prediction from 3D volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a necessary step in medical imaging analysis, which can assist greatly in clinical diagnosis. Traditional deep learning models suffer from severe performance degradation when applied to clinically acquired unlabeled data. The performance degradation is mainly caused by domain discrepancy such as different device types and parameter settings for data acquisition. However, existing approaches focus on the reduction of domain discrepancies but ignore the entanglement of semantic features and domain information. In this article, we explore the feature invariance of categories and domains in different projection spaces and propose a Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation (STDA) method using a joint optimal transport theory and contrastive learning for automatic 3D MRI classification and glioma multi-grade prediction. Specifically, the learning framework updates the distribution of features across domains and categories by Siamese transport network training with an Optimal Cost Transfer Strategy (OCTS) and a Mutual Invariant Constraint (MIC) in two projective spaces to find multiple invariants in potential heterogeneity. We design three sets of transfer task scenarios with different source and target domains, and demonstrate that STDA yields substantially higher generalization performance than other state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. The method is applicable on 3D MRI data from glioma to Alzheimer's disease and has promising applications in the future clinical diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Brain","Yu, L; Liu, J; Wu, Q; Wang, J; Qu, A"

Biomarker discovery process at binomial decision point (2BDP): Analytical pipeline to construct biomarker panel.,"A clinical incident is typically manifested by several molecular events; therefore, it seems logical that a successful diagnosis, prognosis, or stratification of a clinical landmark require multiple biomarkers. In this report, we presented a machine learning pipeline, namely ""Biomarker discovery process at binomial decision point"" (2BDP) that took an integrative approach in systematically curating independent variables (e.g., multiple molecular markers) to explain an output variable (e.g., clinical landmark) of binary in nature. In a logical sequence, 2BDP includes feature selection, unsupervised model development and cross validation. In the present work, the efficiency of 2BDP was demonstrated by finding three biomarker panels that independently explained three stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) marked as Braak stages I, II and III, respectively. We designed three assortments from the entire cohort based on these Braak stages; subsequently, each assortment was split into two populations at Braak score I, II or III. 2BDP systematically integrated random forest and logistic regression fitting model to find biomarker panels with minimum features that explained these three assortments, e.g., significantly differentiated two populations segregated by Braak stage I, II or III, respectively. Thereafter, the efficacies of these panels were measured by the area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot.

Integrative multi-omics and systems bioinformatics in translational neuroscience: A data mining perspective.,"Bioinformatic analysis of large and complex omics datasets has become increasingly useful in modern day biology by providing a great depth of information, with its application to neuroscience termed neuroinformatics. Data mining of omics datasets has enabled the generation of new hypotheses based on differentially regulated biological molecules associated with disease mechanisms, which can be tested experimentally for improved diagnostic and therapeutic targeting of neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, integrating multi-omics data using a systems bioinformatics approach will advance the understanding of the layered and interactive network of biological regulation that exchanges systemic knowledge to facilitate the development of a comprehensive human brain profile. In this review, we first summarize data mining studies utilizing datasets from the individual type of omics analysis, including epigenetics/epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and spatial omics, pertaining to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We then discuss multi-omics integration approaches, including independent biological integration and unsupervised integration methods, for more intuitive and informative interpretation of the biological data obtained across different omics layers. We further assess studies that integrate multi-omics in data mining which provide convoluted biological insights and offer proof-of-concept proposition towards systems bioinformatics in the reconstruction of brain networks. Finally, we recommend a combination of high dimensional bioinformatics analysis with experimental validation to achieve translational neuroscience applications including biomarker discovery, therapeutic development, and elucidation of disease mechanisms. We conclude by providing future perspectives and opportunities in applying integrative multi-omics and systems bioinformatics to achieve precision phenotyping of neurodegenerative diseases and towards personalized medicine.",2023,Data mining; Human brain profile reconstruction; Multi-omics integration; Systems bioinformatics; Translational neuroscience,,"O'Connor, LM; O'Connor, BA; Lim, SB; Zeng, J; Lo, CH"

Unsupervised contrastive graph learning for resting-state functional MRI analysis and brain disorder detection.,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) helps characterize regional interactions that occur in the human brain at a resting state. Existing research often attempts to explore fMRI biomarkers that best predict brain disease progression using machine/deep learning techniques. Previous fMRI studies have shown that learning-based methods usually require a large amount of labeled training data, limiting their utility in clinical practice where annotating data is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To this end, we propose an unsupervised contrastive graph learning (UCGL) framework for fMRI-based brain disease analysis, in which a pretext model is designed to generate informative fMRI representations using unlabeled training data, followed by model fine-tuning to perform downstream disease identification tasks. Specifically, in the pretext model, we first design a bi-level fMRI augmentation strategy to increase the sample size by augmenting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, and then employ two parallel graph convolutional networks for fMRI feature extraction in an unsupervised contrastive learning manner. This pretext model can be optimized on large-scale fMRI datasets, without requiring labeled training data. This model is further fine-tuned on to-be-analyzed fMRI data for downstream disease detection in a task-oriented learning manner. We evaluate the proposed method on three rs-fMRI datasets for cross-site and cross-dataset learning tasks. Experimental results suggest that the UCGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in automated diagnosis of three brain diseases (i.e., major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease) with rs-fMRI data.",2023,brain disorder; data augmentation; fine-tuning; functional MRI; small-sample-size,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Rest; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease","Wang, X; Chu, Y; Wang, Q; Cao, L; Qiao, L; Zhang, L; Liu, M"

Artificial intelligence for dementia research methods optimization.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly being used in dementia research. However, several methodological challenges exist that may limit the insights we can obtain from high-dimensional data and our ability to translate these findings into improved patient outcomes. To improve reproducibility and replicability, researchers should make their well-documented code and modeling pipelines openly available. Data should also be shared where appropriate. To enhance the acceptability of models and AI-enabled systems to users, researchers should prioritize interpretable methods that provide insights into how decisions are generated. Models should be developed using multiple, diverse datasets to improve robustness, generalizability, and reduce potentially harmful bias. To improve clarity and reproducibility, researchers should adhere to reporting guidelines that are co-produced with multiple stakeholders. If these methodological challenges are overcome, AI and ML hold enormous promise for changing the landscape of dementia research and care. HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning (ML) can improve diagnosis, prevention, and management of dementia. Inadequate reporting of ML procedures affects reproduction/replication of results. ML models built on unrepresentative datasets do not generalize to new datasets. Obligatory metrics for certain model structures and use cases have not been defined.

Graph neural network based unsupervised influential sample selection for brain multigraph population fusion.,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have witnessed remarkable proliferation due to the increasing number of applications where data is represented as graphs. GNN-based multigraph population fusion methods for estimating population representative connectional brain templates (CBT) have recently led to improvements, especially in network neuroscience. However, prior studies do not consider how an individual training brain multigraph influences the quality of GNN training for brain multigraph population fusion. To address this issue, we propose two major sample selection methods to quantify the influence of a training brain multigraph on the brain multigraph population fusion task using GNNs, in a fully unsupervised manner: (1) GraphGradIn, in which we use gradients w.r.t GNN weights to trace changes in the centeredness loss of connectional brain template during the training phase; (2) GraphTestIn, in which we exclude a training brain multigraph of interest during the refinement process in the test phase to infer its influence on the CBT centeredness loss. Next, we select the most influential multigraphs to build the training set for brain multigraph population fusion into a CBT. We conducted extensive experiments on brain multigraph datasets to show that using a dataset of influential training samples improves the learned connectional brain template in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, and topological soundness. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our methods by discovering the connectional fingerprints of healthy and neurologically disordered brain multigraph populations including Alzheimer's disease and Autism spectrum disorder patients.

Style transfer generative adversarial networks to harmonize multisite MRI to a single reference image to avoid overcorrection.,"Recent work within neuroimaging consortia have aimed to identify reproducible, and often subtle, brain signatures of psychiatric or neurological conditions. To allow for high-powered brain imaging analyses, it is often necessary to pool MR images that were acquired with different protocols across multiple scanners. Current retrospective harmonization techniques have shown promise in removing site-related image variation. However, most statistical approaches may over-correct for technical, scanning-related, variation as they cannot distinguish between confounded image-acquisition based variability and site-related population variability. Such statistical methods often require that datasets contain subjects or patient groups with similar clinical or demographic information to isolate the acquisition-based variability. To overcome this limitation, we consider site-related magnetic resonance (MR) imaging harmonization as a style transfer problem rather than a domain transfer problem. Using a fully unsupervised deep-learning framework based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), we show that MR images can be harmonized by inserting the style information encoded from a single reference image, without knowing their site/scanner labels a priori. We trained our model using data from five large-scale multisite datasets with varied demographics. Results demonstrated that our style-encoding model can harmonize MR images, and match intensity profiles, without relying on traveling subjects. This model also avoids the need to control for clinical, diagnostic, or demographic information. We highlight the effectiveness of our method for clinical research by comparing extracted cortical and subcortical features, brain-age estimates, and case-control effect sizes before and after the harmonization. We showed that our harmonization removed the site-related variances, while preserving the anatomical information and clinical meaningful patterns. We further demonstrated that with a diverse training set, our method successfully harmonized MR images collected from unseen scanners and protocols, suggesting a promising tool for ongoing collaborative studies.

Application of Aligned-UMAP to longitudinal biomedical studies.,"High-dimensional data analysis starts with projecting the data to low dimensions to visualize and understand the underlying data structure. Several methods have been developed for dimensionality reduction, but they are limited to cross-sectional datasets. The recently proposed Aligned-UMAP, an extension of the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm, can visualize high-dimensional longitudinal datasets. We demonstrated its utility for researchers to identify exciting patterns and trajectories within enormous datasets in biological sciences. We found that the algorithm parameters also play a crucial role and must be tuned carefully to utilize the algorithm's potential fully. We also discussed key points to remember and directions for future extensions of Aligned-UMAP. Further, we made our code open source to enhance the reproducibility and applicability of our work.

Metabolic Pathway Pairwise-Based Signature as a Potential Non-Invasive Diagnostic Marker in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Early screening, particularly in blood plasma, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to the diagnosis and prevention of AD. In addition, metabolic dysfunction has been demonstrated to be closely related to AD, which might be reflected in the whole blood transcriptome. Hence, we hypothesized that the establishment of a diagnostic model based on the metabolic signatures of blood is a workable strategy. To that end, we initially constructed metabolic pathway pairwise (MPP) signatures to characterize the interplay among metabolic pathways. Then, a series of bioinformatic methodologies, e.g., differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, network analysis, etc., were used to investigate the molecular mechanism behind AD. Moreover, an unsupervised clustering analysis based on the MPP signature profile via the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm was utilized to stratify AD patients. Finally, aimed at distinguishing AD patients from non-AD groups, a metabolic pathway-pairwise scoring system (MPPSS) was established using multi-machine learning methods. As a result, many metabolic pathways correlated to AD were disclosed, including oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, etc. NMF clustering analysis divided AD patients into two subgroups (S1 and S2), which exhibit distinct activities of metabolism and immunity. Typically, oxidative phosphorylation in S2 exhibits a lower activity than that in S1 and non-AD group, suggesting the patients in S2 might possess a more compromised brain metabolism. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis showed that the patients in S2 might have phenomena of immune suppression compared with S1 and the non-AD group. These findings indicated that S2 probably has a more severe progression of AD. Finally, MPPSS could achieve an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.77) in the training dataset, 0.71 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.77) in the testing dataset, and an AUC of 0.99 (95%CI: 0.96, 1.00) in one external validation dataset. Overall, our study successfully established a novel metabolism-based scoring system for AD diagnosis using the blood transcriptome and provided new insight into the molecular mechanism of metabolic dysfunction implicated in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; metabolic abnormalities; multi-machine learning; noninvasive diagnosis; peripheral blood,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Algorithms; Machine Learning; Cluster Analysis; Metabolic Networks and Pathways,"Feng, Y; Chen, X; Zhang, XD; Huang, C"

Neurophenotypes of COVID-19: Risk factors and recovery outcomes.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is associated with risk of persistent neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric complications. It is unclear whether the neuropsychological manifestations of COVID-19 present as a uniform syndrome or as distinct neurophenotypes with differing risk factors and recovery outcomes. We examined post-acute neuropsychological profiles following SARS-CoV-2 infection in 205 patients recruited from inpatient and outpatient populations, using an unsupervised machine learning cluster analysis, with objective and subjective measures as input features. This resulted in three distinct post-COVID clusters. In the largest cluster (69%), cognitive functions were within normal limits, although mild subjective attention and memory complaints were reported. Vaccination was associated with membership in this ""normal cognition"" phenotype. Cognitive impairment was present in the remaining 31% of the sample but clustered into two differentially impaired groups. In 16% of participants, memory deficits, slowed processing speed, and fatigue were predominant. Risk factors for membership in the ""memory-speed impaired"" neurophenotype included anosmia and more severe COVID-19 infection. In the remaining 15% of participants, executive dysfunction was predominant. Risk factors for membership in this milder ""dysexecutive"" neurophenotype included disease-nonspecific factors such as neighborhood deprivation and obesity. Recovery outcomes at 6-month follow-up differed across neurophenotypes, with the normal cognition group showing improvement in verbal memory and psychomotor speed, the dysexecutive group showing improvement in cognitive flexibility, and the memory-speed impaired group showing no objective improvement and relatively worse functional outcomes compared to the other two clusters. These results indicate that there are multiple post-acute neurophenotypes of COVID-19, with different etiological pathways and recovery outcomes.

msQSM: Morphology-based self-supervised deep learning for quantitative susceptibility mapping.,"Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been applied to the measurement of iron deposition and the auxiliary diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease. There still exists a dipole inversion problem in QSM reconstruction. Recently, deep learning approaches have been proposed to resolve this problem. However, most of these approaches are supervised methods that need pairs of the input phase and ground-truth. It remains a challenge to train a model for all resolutions without using the ground-truth and only using one resolution data. To address this, we proposed a self-supervised QSM deep learning method based on morphology. It consists of a morphological QSM builder to decouple the dependency of the QSM on acquisition resolution, and a morphological loss to reduce artifacts effectively and save training time efficiently. The proposed method can reconstruct arbitrary resolution QSM on both human data and animal data, regardless of whether the resolution is higher or lower than that of the training set. Our method outperforms the previous best unsupervised method with a 3.6% higher peak signal-to-noise ratio, 16.2% lower normalized root mean square error, and 22.1% lower high-frequency error norm. The morphological loss reduces training time by 22.1% with respect to the cycle gradient loss used in the previous unsupervised methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method accurately measures QSM with arbitrary resolutions, and achieves state-of-the-art results among unsupervised deep learning methods. Research on applications in neurodegenerative diseases found that our method is robust enough to measure significant increase in striatal magnetic susceptibility in patients during Alzheimer's disease progression, as well as significant increase in substantia nigra susceptibility in Parkinson's disease patients, and can be used as an auxiliary differential diagnosis tool for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Arbitrary resolution; Parkinson’s disease; Self-supervised learning; Susceptibility quantitative mapping,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Deep Learning; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Brain Mapping; Brain; Algorithms","He, J; Peng, Y; Fu, B; Zhu, Y; Wang, L; Wang, R"

Genetic risk factor clustering within and across neurodegenerative diseases.,"Overlapping symptoms and co-pathologies are common in closely related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Investigating genetic risk variants across these NDDs can give further insight into disease manifestations. In this study we have leveraged genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and genome-wide association study summary statistics to cluster patients based on their genetic status across identified risk variants for five NDDs (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia). The multi-disease and disease-specific clustering results presented here provide evidence that NDDs have more overlapping genetic aetiology than previously expected and how neurodegeneration should be viewed as a spectrum of symptomology. These clustering analyses also show potential subsets of patients with these diseases that are significantly depleted for any known common genetic risk factors suggesting environmental or other factors at work.

"Unsupervised, frequent and remote: A novel platform for personalised digital phenotyping of long-term memory in humans.","Long-term memory tests are commonly used to facilitate the diagnosis of hippocampal-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease due to their relatively high specificity and sensitivity to damage to the medial temporal lobes compared to standard commonly used clinical tests. Pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease start years before the formal diagnosis is made, partially due to testing too late. This proof-of-concept exploratory study aimed to assess the feasibility of introducing an unsupervised digital platform for continuous testing of long-term memory over long periods outside the laboratory environment. To address this challenge, we developed a novel digital platform, hAge ('healthy Age'), which integrates double spatial alternation, image recognition and visuospatial tasks for frequent remote unsupervised assessment of spatial and non-spatial long-term memory carried out continuously over eight week period. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we tested whether we could achieve sufficient levels of adherence and whether the performance on hAge tasks is comparable to the performance observed in the analogous standard tests measured in the controlled laboratory environments.191 healthy adults (67% females, 18-81 years old) participated in the study. We report an estimated 42.4% adherence level with minimal inclusion criteria. In line with findings using standard laboratory tests, we showed that performance on the spatial alternation task negatively correlated with inter-trial periods and the performance levels on image recognition and visuospatial tasks could be controlled by varying image similarity. Importantly, we demonstrated that frequent engagement with the double spatial alternation task leads to a strong practice effect, previously identified as a potential measure of cognitive decline in MCI patients. Finally, we discuss how lifestyle and motivation confounds may present a serious challenge for cognitive assessment in real-world uncontrolled environments.",2023,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Long-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; Recognition, Psychology; Proof of Concept Study","Bauza, M; Krstulovic, M; Krupic, J"
Multi-omic integration via similarity network fusion to detect molecular subtypes of ageing.,"Molecular subtyping of brain tissue provides insights into the heterogeneity of common neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, existing subtyping studies have mostly focused on single data modalities and only those individuals with severe cognitive impairment. To address these gaps, we applied similarity network fusion, a method capable of integrating multiple high-dimensional multi-omic data modalities simultaneously, to an elderly sample spanning the full spectrum of cognitive ageing trajectories. We analyzed human frontal cortex brain samples characterized by five omic modalities: bulk RNA sequencing (18 629 genes), DNA methylation (53 932 CpG sites), histone acetylation (26 384 peaks), proteomics (7737 proteins) and metabolomics (654 metabolites). Similarity network fusion followed by spectral clustering was used for subtype detection, and subtype numbers were determined by Eigen-gap and rotation cost statistics. Normalized mutual information determined the relative contribution of each modality to the fused network. Subtypes were characterized by associations with 13 age-related neuropathologies and cognitive decline. Fusion of all five data modalities (",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; clustering analysis; cognitive ageing; molecular subtyping; multi-omic integration,,"Yang, M; Matan-Lithwick, S; Wang, Y; De Jager, PL; Bennett, DA; Felsky, D"
Size matters: the impact of nucleus size on results from spatial transcriptomics.,"Visium Spatial Gene Expression (ST) is a method combining histological spatial information with transcriptomics profiles directly from tissue sections. The use of spatial information has made it possible to discover new modes of gene expression regulations. However, in the ST experiment, the nucleus size of cells may exceed the thickness of a tissue slice. This may, in turn, negatively affect comprehensive capturing the transcriptomics profile in a single slice, especially for tissues having large differences in the size of nuclei.",2023,Cerebral cortex; Consecutive tissue sections; Data integration; Neuronal nuclei; Spatial transcriptomics,Humans; Transcriptome; Gene Expression Profiling; RNA-Seq; Brain; Cell Communication,"Mohammadi, E; Chojnowska, K; Bieńkowski, M; Kostecka, A; Koczkowska, M; Żmijewski, MA; Jąkalski, M; Ingelsson, M; Filipowicz, N; Olszewski, P; Davies, H; Wierzbicka, JM; Hyman, BT; Dumanski, JP; Piotrowski, A; Mieczkowski, J"
Three-round learning strategy based on 3D deep convolutional GANs for Alzheimer's disease staging.,"Accurately diagnosing of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stages is critical for prompt treatment or potential intervention to delay the the disease's progression. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models have shown promising results in structural MRI (sMRI)-based diagnosis, but their performance, particularly for 3D models, is constrained by the lack of labeled training samples. To address the overfitting problem brought on by the insufficient training sample size, we propose a three-round learning strategy that combines transfer learning with generative adversarial learning. In the first round, a 3D Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) model was trained with all available sMRI data to learn the common feature of sMRI through unsupervised generative adversarial learning. The second round involved transferring and fine-tuning, and the pre-trained discriminator (D) of the DCGAN learned more specific features for the classification task between AD and cognitively normal (CN). In the final round, the weights learned in the AD versus CN classification task were transferred to the MCI diagnosis. By highlighting brain regions with high prediction weights using 3D Grad-CAM, we further enhanced the model's interpretability. The proposed model achieved accuracies of 92.8%, 78.1%, and 76.4% in the classifications of AD versus CN, AD versus MCI, and MCI versus CN, respectively. The experimental results show that our proposed model avoids overfitting brought on by a paucity of sMRI data and enables the early detection of AD.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Learning; Brain; Overweight; Cognitive Dysfunction","Kang, W; Lin, L; Sun, S; Wu, S"
Deep learning-based polygenic risk analysis for Alzheimer's disease prediction.,"The polygenic nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests that multiple variants jointly contribute to disease susceptibility. As an individual's genetic variants are constant throughout life, evaluating the combined effects of multiple disease-associated genetic risks enables reliable AD risk prediction. Because of the complexity of genomic data, current statistical analyses cannot comprehensively capture the polygenic risk of AD, resulting in unsatisfactory disease risk prediction. However, deep learning methods, which capture nonlinearity within high-dimensional genomic data, may enable more accurate disease risk prediction and improve our understanding of AD etiology. Accordingly, we developed deep learning neural network models for modeling AD polygenic risk.",2023,,,"Zhou, X; Chen, Y; Ip, FCF; Jiang, Y; Cao, H; Lv, G; Zhong, H; Chen, J; Ye, T; Chen, Y; Zhang, Y; Ma, S; Lo, RMN; Tong, EPS; Mok, VCT; Kwok, TCY; Guo, Q; Mok, KY; Shoai, M; Hardy, J; Chen, L; Fu, AKY; Ip, NY"
Reduction of vowel space in Alzheimer's disease.,"Reduced vowel space area (VSA) is a known effect of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Using large publicly available corpuses, two experiments were conducted comparing the vowel space of speakers with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD) during spontaneous and read speech. First, a comparison of vowel distance found reduced distance in AD for English spontaneous speech, but not Spanish read speech. Findings were then verified using an unsupervised learning approach to quantify VSA through cluster center detection. These results corroborate observations for PD that VSA reduction is task-dependent, but further experiments are necessary to quantify the effect of language.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech; Language; Speech Production Measurement; Parkinson Disease,"Shamei, A; Liu, Y; Gick, B"
Supervised convex clustering.,"Clustering has long been a popular unsupervised learning approach to identify groups of similar objects and discover patterns from unlabeled data in many applications. Yet, coming up with meaningful interpretations of the estimated clusters has often been challenging precisely due to their unsupervised nature. Meanwhile, in many real-world scenarios, there are some noisy supervising auxiliary variables, for instance, subjective diagnostic opinions, that are related to the observed heterogeneity of the unlabeled data. By leveraging information from both supervising auxiliary variables and unlabeled data, we seek to uncover more scientifically interpretable group structures that may be hidden by completely unsupervised analyses. In this work, we propose and develop a new statistical pattern discovery method named supervised convex clustering (SCC) that borrows strength from both information sources and guides towards finding more interpretable patterns via a joint convex fusion penalty. We develop several extensions of SCC to integrate different types of supervising auxiliary variables, to adjust for additional covariates, and to find biclusters. We demonstrate the practical advantages of SCC through simulations and a case study on Alzheimer's disease genomics. Specifically, we discover new candidate genes as well as new subtypes of Alzheimer's disease that can potentially lead to better understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for the observed heterogeneity of cognitive decline in older adults.",2023,convex clustering; exponential family; generalized linear model deviance; interpretable clustering; supervised clustering,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Genomics; Cluster Analysis,"Wang, M; Yao, T; Allen, GI"

DeAF: A multimodal deep learning framework for disease prediction.,"Multimodal deep learning models have been applied for disease prediction tasks, but difficulties exist in training due to the conflict between sub-models and fusion modules. To alleviate this issue, we propose a framework for decoupling feature alignment and fusion (DeAF), which separates the multimodal model training into two stages. In the first stage, unsupervised representation learning is conducted, and the modality adaptation (MA) module is used to align the features from various modalities. In the second stage, the self-attention fusion (SAF) module combines the medical image features and clinical data using supervised learning. Moreover, we apply the DeAF framework to predict the postoperative efficacy of CRS for colorectal cancer and whether the MCI patients change to Alzheimer's disease. The DeAF framework achieves a significant improvement in comparison to the previous methods. Furthermore, extensive ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of our framework. In conclusion, our framework enhances the interaction between the local medical image features and clinical data, and derive more discriminative multimodal features for disease prediction.

Long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in an app and wearable-based multinational remote digital depression study.,"Recent growth in digital technologies has enabled the recruitment and monitoring of large and diverse populations in remote health studies. However, the generalizability of inference drawn from remotely collected health data could be severely impacted by uneven participant engagement and attrition over the course of the study. We report findings on long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in a large multinational observational digital study for depression containing active (surveys) and passive sensor data collected via Android smartphones, and Fitbit devices from 614 participants for up to 2 years. Majority of participants (67.6%) continued to remain engaged in the study after 43 weeks. Unsupervised clustering of participants' study apps and Fitbit usage data showed 3 distinct engagement subgroups for each data stream. We found: (i) the least engaged group had the highest depression severity (4 PHQ8 points higher) across all data streams; (ii) the least engaged group (completed 4 bi-weekly surveys) took significantly longer to respond to survey notifications (3.8 h more) and were 5 years younger compared to the most engaged group (completed 20 bi-weekly surveys); and (iii) a considerable proportion (44.6%) of the participants who stopped completing surveys after 8 weeks continued to share passive Fitbit data for significantly longer (average 42 weeks). Additionally, multivariate survival models showed participants' age, ownership and brand of smartphones, and recruitment sites to be associated with retention in the study.

Multi-region brain transcriptomes uncover two subtypes of aging individuals with differences in Alzheimer risk and the impact of ,"The heterogeneity of the older population suggests the existence of subsets of individuals which share certain brain molecular features and respond differently to risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, but this population structure remains poorly defined. Here, we performed an unsupervised clustering of individuals with multi-region brain transcriptomes to assess whether a broader approach, simultaneously considering data from multiple regions involved in cognition would uncover such subsets. We implemented a canonical correlation-based analysis in a Discovery cohort of 459 participants from two longitudinal studies of cognitive aging that have RNA sequence profiles in three brain regions. 690 additional participants that have data in only one or two of these regions were used in the Replication effort. These clustering analyses identified two meta-clusters, MC-1 and MC-2. The two sets of participants differ primarily in their trajectories of cognitive decline, with MC-2 having a delay of 3 years to the median age of incident dementia. This is due, in part, to a greater impact of tau pathology on neuronal chromatin architecture and to broader brain changes including greater loss of white matter integrity in MC-1.

Deciphering the clinico-radiological heterogeneity of dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease.,"Dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease (dAD) manifests as a progressive dysexecutive syndrome without prominent behavioral features, and previous studies suggest clinico-radiological heterogeneity within this syndrome. We uncovered this heterogeneity using unsupervised machine learning in 52 dAD patients with multimodal imaging and cognitive data. A spectral decomposition of covariance between FDG-PET images yielded six latent factors (""eigenbrains"") accounting for 48% of variance in patterns of hypometabolism. These eigenbrains differentially related to age at onset, clinical severity, and cognitive performance. A hierarchical clustering on the eigenvalues of these eigenbrains yielded four dAD subtypes, i.e. ""left-dominant,"" ""right-dominant,"" ""bi-parietal-dominant,"" and ""heteromodal-diffuse."" Patterns of FDG-PET hypometabolism overlapped with those of tau-PET distribution and MRI neurodegeneration for each subtype, whereas patterns of amyloid deposition were similar across subtypes. Subtypes differed in age at onset and clinical severity where the heteromodal-diffuse exhibited a worse clinical picture, and the bi-parietal had a milder clinical presentation. We propose a conceptual framework of executive components based on the clinico-radiological associations observed in dAD. We demonstrate that patients with dAD, despite sharing core clinical features, are diagnosed with variability in their clinical and neuroimaging profiles.

Predictive Models and Features of Patient Mortality across Dementia Types.,"Dementia care is challenging due to the divergent trajectories in disease progression and outcomes. Predictive models are needed to identify patients at risk of near-term mortality. Here, we developed machine learning models predicting survival using a dataset of 45,275 unique participants and 163,782 visit records from the U.S. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Our models achieved an AUC-ROC of over 0.82 utilizing nine parsimonious features for all one-, three-, five-, and ten-year thresholds. The trained models mainly consisted of dementia-related predictors such as specific neuropsychological tests and were minimally affected by other age-related causes of death, e.g., stroke and cardiovascular conditions. Notably, stratified analyses revealed shared and distinct predictors of mortality across eight dementia types. Unsupervised clustering of mortality predictors grouped vascular dementia with depression and Lewy body dementia with frontotemporal lobar dementia.

Classifying Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia using machine learning with cross-sectional and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are common causes of dementia with partly overlapping, symptoms and brain signatures. There is a need to establish an accurate diagnosis and to obtain markers for disease tracking. We combined unsupervised and supervised machine learning to discriminate between AD and FTD using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We included baseline 3T-T1 MRI data from 339 subjects: 99 healthy controls (CTR), 153 AD and 87 FTD patients; and 2-year follow-up data from 114 subjects. We obtained subcortical gray matter volumes and cortical thickness measures using FreeSurfer. We used dimensionality reduction to obtain a single feature that was later used in a support vector machine for classification. Discrimination patterns were obtained with the contribution of each region to the single feature. Our algorithm differentiated CTR versus AD and CTR versus FTD at the cross-sectional level with 83.3% and 82.1% of accuracy. These increased up to 90.0% and 88.0% with longitudinal data. When we studied the classification between AD versus FTD we obtained an accuracy of 63.3% at the cross-sectional level and 75.0% for longitudinal data. The AD versus FTD versus CTR classification has reached an accuracy of 60.7%, and 71.3% for cross-sectional and longitudinal data respectively. Disease discrimination brain maps are in concordance with previous results obtained with classical approaches. By using a single feature, we were capable to classify CTR, AD, and FTD with good accuracy, considering the inherent overlap between diseases.

Artificial intelligence-driven meta-analysis of brain gene expression identifies novel gene candidates and a role for mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. There is no treatment and AD models have focused on a small subset of genes identified in familial AD. Microarray studies have identified thousands of dysregulated genes in the brains of patients with AD yet identifying the best gene candidates to both model and treat AD remains a challenge. We performed a meta-analysis of microarray data from the frontal cortex (n = 697) and cerebellum (n = 230) of AD patients and healthy controls. A two-stage artificial intelligence approach, with both unsupervised and supervised machine learning, combined with a functional network analysis was used to identify functionally connected and biologically relevant novel gene candidates in AD. We found that in the frontal cortex, genes involved in mitochondrial energy, ATP, and oxidative phosphorylation, were the most significant dysregulated genes. In the cerebellum, dysregulated genes were involved in mitochondrial cellular biosynthesis (mitochondrial ribosomes). Although there was little overlap between dysregulated genes between the frontal cortex and cerebellum, machine learning models comprised of this overlap. A further functional network analysis of these genes identified that two downregulated genes, ATP5L and ATP5H, which both encode subunits of ATP synthase (mitochondrial complex V) may play a role in AD. Combined, our results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly a deficit in energy homeostasis, may play an important role in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Gene expression; Machine learning; Microarray; Mitochondria,,"Finney, CA; Delerue, F; Gold, WA; Brown, DA; Shvetcov, A"
Proteomic clusters underlie heterogeneity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease progression.,"Heterogeneity in progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses challenges for both clinical prognosis and clinical trial implementation. Multiple AD-related subtypes have previously been identified, suggesting differences in receptivity to drug interventions. We identified early differences in preclinical AD biomarkers, assessed patterns for developing preclinical AD across the amyloid-tau-(neurodegeneration) [AT(N)] framework, and considered potential sources of difference by analysing the CSF proteome. Participants (n = 10) enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center completed four or more lumbar punctures. These individuals were cognitively normal at baseline. Cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid-β (Aβ)42, phosphorylated tau (pTau181), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) as well as proteomics values were evaluated. Imaging biomarkers, including PET amyloid and tau, and structural MRI, were repeatedly obtained when available. Individuals were staged according to the amyloid-tau-(neurodegeneration) framework. Growth mixture modelling, an unsupervised clustering technique, identified three patterns of biomarker progression as measured by CSF pTau181 and Aβ42. Two groups (AD Biomarker Positive and Intermediate AD Biomarker) showed distinct progression from normal biomarker status to having biomarkers consistent with preclinical AD. A third group (AD Biomarker Negative) did not develop abnormal AD biomarkers over time. Participants grouped by CSF trajectories were re-classified using only proteomic profiles (AUCAD Biomarker Positive versus AD Biomarker Negative = 0.857, AUCAD Biomarker Positive versus Intermediate AD Biomarkers = 0.525, AUCIntermediate AD Biomarkers versus AD Biomarker Negative = 0.952). We highlight heterogeneity in the development of AD biomarkers in cognitively normal individuals. We identified some individuals who became amyloid positive before the age of 50 years. A second group, Intermediate AD Biomarkers, developed elevated CSF ptau181 significantly before becoming amyloid positive. A third group were AD Biomarker Negative over repeated testing. Our results could influence the selection of participants for specific treatments (e.g. amyloid-reducing versus other agents) in clinical trials.

Semisupervised white matter hyperintensities segmentation on MRI.,"This study proposed a semisupervised loss function named level-set loss (LSLoss) for cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) segmentation on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. The training procedure did not require manually labeled WMH masks. Our image preprocessing steps included biased field correction, skull stripping, and white matter segmentation.

Identifying Modality-Consistent and Modality-Specific Features via Label-Guided Multi-Task Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Neuroimaging Genetics.,"Brain imaging genetics provides the foundation for further revealing brain disorder, which combines genetic variation with brain structure or functions. Recently, sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) and multimodality analysis have been widely utilized for imaging genetics. However, SCCA is an unsupervised learning method which ignores the diagnostic information related to the disease. Traditional multimodality analysis cannot distinguish the consistent and specific information from different neuroimaging that are correlated to the genotypic variances. In this paper, we propose the Label-Guided Multi-task Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (LGMTSCCA) method to identify the informative features from the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and brain regions related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, LGMTSCCA uses label constraint via inducing diagnostic information to guide the imaging genetic correlation learning. Considering multi-modal imaging genetic correlations, we use the weight decomposition strategy to calculate the correlation weights in consistency and specificity with different parameters. We evaluate the effectiveness of the LGMTSCCA on synthetic and real data sets.
