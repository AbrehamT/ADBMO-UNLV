Clinically feasible automated MRI volumetry of the brain as a prognostic marker in subjective and mild cognitive impairment.,"The number of patients suffering from cognitive decline and dementia increases, and new possible treatments are being developed. Thus, the need for time efficient and cost-effective methods to facilitate an early diagnosis and prediction of future cognitive decline in patients with early cognitive symptoms is becoming increasingly important. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether an MRI based software, NeuroQuant® (NQ), producing volumetry of the hippocampus and whole brain volume (WBV) could predict: (1) conversion from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at baseline to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia at follow-up, and from MCI at baseline to dementia at follow-up and (2) progression of cognitive and functional decline defined as an annual increase in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Clinical Dementia Rating Scale; automated volumetry NeuroQuant®; dementia; disease progression; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment; subjective cognitive decline,,"Amland, R; Selbæk, G; Brækhus, A; Edwin, TH; Engedal, K; Knapskog, AB; Olsrud, ER; Persson, K"
Rapid Microbial Profiling through Multimodal Biosensors for Transversal Analysis.,"The intricate interactions between host and microbial communities hold significant implications for biology and medicine. However, traditional microbial profiling methods face limitations in processing time, measurement of absolute abundance, detection of low biomass, discrimination between live and dead cells, and functional analysis. This study introduces a rapid multimodal microbial characterization platform, Multimodal Biosensors for Transversal Analysis (MBioTA), for capturing the taxonomy, viability, and functional genes of the microbiota. The platform incorporates single cell biosensors, scalable microwell arrays, and automated image processing for rapid transversal analysis in as few as 2 h. The multimodal biosensors simultaneously characterize the taxon, viability, and functional gene expression of individual cells. By automating the image processing workflow, the single cell analysis techniques enable the quantification of bacteria with sensitivity down to 0.0075%, showcasing its capability in detecting low biomass samples. We illustrate the applicability of the MBioTA platform through the transversal analysis of the gut microbiota composition, viability, and functionality in a familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model. The effectiveness, rapid turnaround, and scalability of the MBioTA platform will facilitate its application from basic research to clinical diagnostics, potentially revolutionizing our understanding and management of diseases associated with microbe-host interactions.",2024,,,"Lee, JH; Chin, SM; Chan, DC; Liao, JC; Yang, S; Zhang, N; Wong, PK"
Extraction of sleep information from clinical notes of Alzheimer's disease patients using natural language processing.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. Sleep is one of the lifestyle-related factors that has been shown critical for optimal cognitive function in old age. However, there is a lack of research studying the association between sleep and AD incidence. A major bottleneck for conducting such research is that the traditional way to acquire sleep information is time-consuming, inefficient, non-scalable, and limited to patients' subjective experience. We aim to automate the extraction of specific sleep-related patterns, such as snoring, napping, poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, night wakings, other sleep problems, and sleep duration, from clinical notes of AD patients. These sleep patterns are hypothesized to play a role in the incidence of AD, providing insight into the relationship between sleep and AD onset and progression.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; clinical notes; electronic health records; information extraction; natural language processing; sleep,,"Sivarajkumar, S; Tam, TYC; Mohammad, HA; Viggiano, S; Oniani, D; Visweswaran, S; Wang, Y"
Brain and Ventricle Volume Alterations in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Determined by Artificial Intelligence-Based MRI Volumetry.,"The aim of this study was to employ artificial intelligence (AI)-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain volumetry to potentially distinguish between idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (CG) by evaluating cortical, subcortical, and ventricular volumes. Additionally, correlations between the measured brain and ventricle volumes and two established semi-quantitative radiologic markers for iNPH were examined. An IRB-approved retrospective analysis was conducted on 123 age- and sex-matched subjects (41 iNPH, 41 AD, and 41 controls), with all of the iNPH patients undergoing routine clinical brain MRI prior to ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation. Automated AI-based determination of different cortical and subcortical brain and ventricular volumes in mL, as well as calculation of population-based normalized percentiles according to an embedded database, was performed; the CE-certified software mdbrain v4.4.1 or above was used with a standardized T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence. Measured brain volumes and percentiles were analyzed for between-group differences and correlated with semi-quantitative measurements of the Evans' index and corpus callosal angle: iNPH patients exhibited ventricular enlargement and changes in gray and white matter compared to AD patients and controls, with the most significant differences observed in total ventricular volume (+67%) and the lateral (+68%), third (+38%), and fourth (+31%) ventricles compared to controls. Global ventriculomegaly and marked white matter reduction with concomitant preservation of gray matter compared to AD and CG were characteristic of iNPH, whereas global and frontoparietally accentuated gray matter reductions were characteristic of AD. Evans' index and corpus callosal angle differed significantly between the three groups and moderately correlated with the lateral ventricular volumes in iNPH patients [Evans' index (r > 0.83, ",2024,automated volumetrization; brain atrophy; normal pressure hydrocephalus; quantitative neuroimaging,,"Bendella, Z; Purrer, V; Haase, R; Zülow, S; Kindler, C; Borger, V; Banat, M; Dorn, F; Wüllner, U; Radbruch, A; Schmeel, FC"
An Overall Automated Architecture Based on the Tapping Test Measurement Protocol: Hand Dexterity Assessment through an Innovative Objective Method.,"The present work focuses on the tapping test, which is a method that is commonly used in the literature to assess dexterity, speed, and motor coordination by repeatedly moving fingers, performing a tapping action on a flat surface. During the test, the activation of specific brain regions enhances fine motor abilities, improving motor control. The research also explores neuromuscular and biomechanical factors related to finger dexterity, revealing neuroplastic adaptation to repetitive movements. To give an objective evaluation of all cited physiological aspects, this work proposes a measurement architecture consisting of the following: (i) a novel measurement protocol to assess the coordinative and conditional capabilities of a population of participants; (ii) a suitable measurement platform, consisting of synchronized and non-invasive inertial sensors to be worn at finger level; (iii) a data analysis processing stage, able to provide the final user (medical doctor or training coach) with a plethora of useful information about the carried-out tests, going far beyond state-of-the-art results from classical tapping test examinations. Particularly, the proposed study underscores the importance interdigital autonomy for complex finger motions, despite the challenges posed by anatomical connections; this deepens our understanding of upper limb coordination and the impact of neuroplasticity, holding significance for motor abilities assessment, improvement, and therapeutic strategies to enhance finger precision. The proof-of-concept test is performed by considering a population of college students. The obtained results allow us to consider the proposed architecture to be valuable for many application scenarios, such as the ones related to neurodegenerative disease evolution monitoring.",2024,IMU sensors; coordinative abilities; hand dexterity; measurement platform; neuroplasticity; tapping test,Humans; Fingers; Hand; Motor Skills; Biomechanical Phenomena; Movement; Male; Adult; Female; Psychomotor Performance,"Di Libero, T; Carissimo, C; Cerro, G; Abbatecola, AM; Marino, A; Miele, G; Ferrigno, L; Rodio, A"
Characterization of local white matter microstructural alterations in Alzheimer's disease: A reproducible study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a close association with microstructural alterations in white matter (WM). Current studies lack the characterization and further validation of specific regions in WM fiber tracts in AD. This study subdivided fiber tracts into multiple fiber clusters on the basis of automated fiber clustering and performed quantitative analysis along the fiber clusters to identify local WM microstructural alterations in AD. Diffusion tensor imaging data from a public dataset (53 patients with AD and 70 healthy controls [HCs]) and a clinical dataset (27 patients with AD and 19 HCs) were included for mutual validation. Whole-brain tractograms were automatically subdivided into 800 clusters through the automatic fiber clustering approach. Then, 100 segments were divided along the clusters, and the diffusion properties of each segment were calculated. Results showed that patients with AD had significantly lower fraction anisotropy (FA) and significantly higher mean diffusivity (MD) in some regions of the fiber clusters in the cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, external capsule, and corpus callosum than HCs. Importantly, these changes were reproducible across the two datasets. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between FA and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and a negative correlation between MD and MMSE in these clusters. The accuracy of the constructed classifier reached 89.76% with an area under the curve of 0.93. This finding indicates that this study can effectively identify local WM microstructural changes in AD and provides new insight into the analysis and diagnosis of WM abnormalities in patients with AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Automated fiber clustering; Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; White matter,,"Wen, C; Zeng, Q; Zhou, R; Xie, L; Yu, J; Zhang, C; Wang, J; Yu, Y; Gu, Y; Cao, G; Feng, Y; Wang, M"

Evaluation of core Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in saliva and plasma measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays on a fully automated platform.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid peptide beta-42 (Aβ42), Aβ42/40 ratio, and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are precious tools for supporting AD diagnosis. However, their use in clinical practice is limited due to the invasiveness of CSF collection. Thus, there is intensive research to find alternative, noninvasive, and widely accessible biological matrices to measure AD core biomarkers. In this study, we measured AD core biomarkers in saliva and plasma by a fully automated platform. We enrolled all consecutive patients with cognitive decline. For each patient, we measured Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau levels in CSF, saliva, and plasma by Lumipulse G1200 (Fujirebio). We included forty-two patients, of whom 27 had AD. Levels of all biomarkers significantly differed in the three biofluids, with saliva having the lowest and CSF the highest levels of Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau. A positive correlation of pTau, Aβ42/40 ratio, and pTau/Aβ42 ratio levels in CSF and plasma was detected, while no correlation between any biomarker in CSF and saliva was found. Our findings suggest that plasma but not saliva could represent a surrogate biofluid for measuring core AD biomarkers. Specifically, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, pTau/Aβ42 ratio, and pTau could serve as surrogates of the corresponding CSF biomarkers.",2024,AD; Beta-amyloid; Biomarker; Fujirebio; Plasma; Saliva; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Saliva; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments; Luminescent Measurements; Aged, 80 and over","Agnello, L; Giglio, RV; Del Ben, F; Piccoli, T; Colletti, T; Scazzone, C; Lo Sasso, B; Ciaccio, AM; Gambino, CM; Salemi, G; Ciaccio, M"
Improving brain atrophy quantification with deep learning from automated labels using tissue similarity priors.,"Brain atrophy measurements derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are a promising marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis. However, its use in individualized assessments is currently discouraged due to a series of technical and biological issues. In this work, we present a deep learning pipeline for segmentation-based brain atrophy quantification that improves upon the automated labels of the reference method from which it learns. This goal is achieved through tissue similarity regularization that exploits the a priori knowledge that scans from the same subject made within a short interval must have similar tissue volumes. To train the presented pipeline, we use unlabeled pairs of T1-weighted MRI scans having a tissue similarity prior, and generate the target brain tissue segmentations in a fully automated manner using the fsl_anat pipeline implemented in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). Tissue similarity regularization is enforced during training through a weighted loss term that penalizes tissue volume differences between short-interval scan pairs from the same subject. In inference, the pipeline performs end-to-end skull stripping and brain tissue segmentation from a single T1-weighted MRI scan in its native space, i.e., without performing image interpolation. For longitudinal evaluation, each image is independently segmented first, and then measures of change are computed. We evaluate the presented pipeline in two different MRI datasets, MIRIAD and ADNI1, which have longitudinal and short-interval imaging from healthy controls (HC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. In short-interval scan pairs, tissue similarity regularization reduces the quantification error and improves the consistency of measured tissue volumes. In the longitudinal case, the proposed pipeline shows reduced variability of atrophy measures and higher effect sizes of differences in annualized rates between HC and AD subjects. Our pipeline obtains a Cohen's d effect size of d=2.07 on the MIRIAD dataset, an increase from the reference pipeline used to train it (d=1.01), and higher than that of SIENA (d=1.73), a well-known state-of-the-art approach. In the ADNI1 dataset, the proposed pipeline improves its effect size (d=1.37) with respect to the reference pipeline (d=0.80) and surpasses SIENA (d=1.33). The proposed data-driven deep learning regularization reduces the biases and systematic errors learned from the reference segmentation method, which is used to generate the training targets. Improving the accuracy and reliability of atrophy quantification methods is essential to unlock brain atrophy as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in neurodegenerative pathologies.",2024,Brain atrophy quantification; Brain tissue segmentation; Deep learning; Magnetic resonance imaging,,"Clèrigues, A; Valverde, S; Oliver, A; Lladó, X"
Can white matter hyperintensities based Fazekas visual assessment scales inform about Alzheimer's disease pathology in the population?,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are considered hallmark features of cerebral small vessel disease and have recently been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Their distinct spatial distributions, namely periventricular versus deep WMH, may differ by underlying age-related and pathobiological processes contributing to cognitive decline. We aimed to identify the spatial patterns of WMH using the 4-scale Fazekas visual assessment and explore their differential association with age, vascular health, AD imaging markers, namely amyloid and tau burden, and cognition. Because our study consisted of scans from GE and Siemens scanners with different resolutions, we also investigated inter-scanner reproducibility and combinability of WMH measurements on imaging.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Deep white matter hyperintensity; Fazekas score; Periventricular white matter hyperintensity; White matter hyperintensities,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Aged, 80 and over; Positron-Emission Tomography; Reproducibility of Results; Middle Aged; tau Proteins; Brain","Pradeep, A; Raghavan, S; Przybelski, SA; Preboske, GM; Schwarz, CG; Lowe, VJ; Knopman, DS; Petersen, RC; Jack, CR; Graff-Radford, J; Cogswell, PM; Vemuri, P"
Assessing CT-based Volumetric Analysis via Transfer Learning with MRI and Manual Labels for Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"Brain computed tomography (CT) is an accessible and commonly utilized technique for assessing brain structure. In cases of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), the presence of ventriculomegaly is often neuroradiologically evaluated by visual rating and manually measuring each image. Previously, we have developed and tested a deep-learning-model that utilizes transfer learning from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CT-based intracranial tissue segmentation.

A new tau dephosphorylation-targeting chimera for the treatment of tauopathies.,"Abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein plays a pivotal role in a collection of neurodegenerative diseases named tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have recently conceptualized the design of hetero-bifunctional chimeras for selectively promoting the proximity between tau and phosphatase, thus specifically facilitating tau dephosphorylation and removal. Here, we sought to optimize the construction of tau dephosphorylating-targeting chimera (DEPTAC) and obtained a new chimera D14, which had high efficiency in reducing tau phosphorylation both in cell and tauopathy mouse models, while showing limited cytotoxicity. Moreover, D14 ameliorated neurodegeneration in primary cultured hippocampal neurons treated with toxic tau-K18 fragments, and improved cognitive functions of tauopathy mice. These results suggested D14 as a cost-effective drug candidate for the treatment of tauopathies.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Tau; dephosphorylation targeting chimera (DEPTAC); drug development; tauopathy,,"Su, JF; Xiao, Y; Wei, LY; Lei, HY; Sun, F; Wang, WX; Li, SH; Wang, XC; Zheng, J; Wang, JZ"

LCGNet: Local Sequential Feature Coupling Global Representation Learning for Functional Connectivity Network Analysis with fMRI.,"Analysis of functional connectivity networks (FCNs) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has greatly advanced our understanding of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Advanced machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used to learn high-level feature representations of FCNs for automated brain disease classification. Even though convolution operations in CNNs are good at extracting local properties of FCNs, they generally cannot well capture global temporal representations of FCNs. Recently, the transformer technique has demonstrated remarkable performance in various tasks, which is attributed to its effective self-attention mechanism in capturing the global temporal feature representations. However, it cannot effectively model the local network characteristics of FCNs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel network structure for Local sequential feature Coupling Global representation learning (LCGNet) to take advantage of convolutional operations and self-attention mechanisms for enhanced FCN representation learning. Specifically, we first build a dynamic FCN for each subject using an overlapped sliding window approach. We then construct three sequential components (i.e., edge-to-vertex layer, vertex-to-network layer, and network-to-temporality layer) with a dual backbone branch of CNN and transformer to extract and couple from local to global topological information of brain networks. Experimental results on two real datasets (i.e., ADNI and ADHD-200) with rs-fMRI data show the superiority of our LCGNet.",2024,,,"Zhou, J; Jie, B; Wang, Z; Zhang, Z; Du, T; Bian, W; Yang, Y; Jia, J"

Accurate identification of individuals with subjective cognitive decline using 3D regional fractal dimensions on structural magnetic resonance imaging.,"Accurate identification of individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is crucial for early intervention and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Fractal dimensionality (FD) has emerged as a robust and replicable measure, surpassing traditional geometric metrics, in characterizing the intricate fractal geometrical properties of brain structure.

A 3D regional FD method can be suggested to characterize and quantify the spatial complexity of the precise gray matter, providing insights into cognitive aging and aiding in the automated identification of individuals with SCD.",2024,Fractal dimension; Integer ratio based 3D box-counting fractal analysis; Structural magnetic resonance imaging; Subjective cognitive decline; individual identification,,"Ni, H; Xue, J; Qin, J; Zhang, Y"
A Stochastic Landscape Approach for Protein Folding State Classification.,"Protein folding is a critical process that determines the functional state of proteins. Proper folding is essential for proteins to acquire their functional three-dimensional structures and execute their biological role, whereas misfolded proteins can lead to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Therefore, a deeper understanding of protein folding is vital for understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies. This study introduces the Stochastic Landscape Classification (SLC), an innovative, automated, nonlearning algorithm that quantitatively analyzes protein folding dynamics. Focusing on collective variables (CVs) - low-dimensional representations of complex dynamical systems like molecular dynamics (MD) of macromolecules - the SLC approach segments the CVs into distinct macrostates, revealing the protein folding pathway explored by MD simulations. The segmentation is achieved by analyzing changes in CV trends and clustering these segments using a standard density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) scheme. Applied to the MD-based CV trajectories of Chignolin and Trp-Cage proteins, the SLC demonstrates apposite accuracy, validated by comparing standard classification metrics against ground-truth data. These metrics affirm the efficacy of the SLC in capturing intricate protein dynamics and offer a method to evaluate and select the most informative CVs. The practical application of this technique lies in its ability to provide a detailed, quantitative description of protein folding processes, with significant implications for understanding and manipulating protein behavior in industrial and pharmaceutical contexts.",2024,,Protein Folding; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Stochastic Processes; Algorithms; Proteins; Oligopeptides; Peptides,"Faran, M; Ray, D; Nag, S; Raucci, U; Parrinello, M; Bisker, G"

A Simple Sandwich Electrochemical Immunosensor for Rapid Detection of the Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Tau Protein.,"As a typical biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, rapid and specific detection of tau protein can help improve the early diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. In this study, a simple sandwich electrochemical immunosensor was developed for rapid detection of tau protein. Primary monoclonal antibodies (mAb1) against the middle domain of tau protein (amino acids 189-195) were immobilized on the gold electrode surface through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 3,3'-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP). Then the tau protein was captured through the specific adsorption between the antigen and the antibody, resulting in a change in the impedance. Secondary monoclonal antibodies (mAb2) against the N-terminal region of tau protein were used for further amplification of the binding reaction between mAb1 and tau protein. A linear correlation between the total change in impedance and the logarithm of tau concentration was found from 2 × 10",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); immunosensor; impedance; sandwich; tau protein,"tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Biosensing Techniques; Biomarkers; Electrochemical Techniques; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Gold; Immunoassay; Limit of Detection; Electrodes","Yang, M; Chen, Y; Sun, H; Li, D; Li, Y"
A novel insight into neurological disorders through HDAC6 protein-protein interactions.,"Due to its involvement in physiological and pathological processes, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is considered a promising pharmaceutical target for several neurological manifestations. However, the exact regulatory role of HDAC6 in the central nervous system (CNS) is still not fully understood. Hence, using a semi-automated literature screening technique, we systematically collected HDAC6-protein interactions that are experimentally validated and reported in the CNS. The resulting HDAC6 network encompassed 115 HDAC6-protein interactions divided over five subnetworks: (de)acetylation, phosphorylation, protein complexes, regulatory, and aggresome-autophagy subnetworks. In addition, 132 indirect interactions identified through HDAC6 inhibition were collected and categorized. Finally, to display the application of our HDAC6 network, we mapped transcriptomics data of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis on the network and highlighted that in the case of Alzheimer's disease, alterations predominantly affect the HDAC6 phosphorylation subnetwork, whereas differential expression within the deacetylation subnetwork is observed across all three neurological disorders. In conclusion, the HDAC6 network created in the present study is a novel and valuable resource for the understanding of the HDAC6 regulatory mechanisms, thereby providing a framework for the integration and interpretation of omics data from neurological disorders and pharmacodynamic assessments.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Central nervous system; Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6); Parkinson’s disease; Protein–protein interactions,Histone Deacetylase 6; Humans; Protein Interaction Maps; Nervous System Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphorylation; Acetylation; Parkinson Disease,"Bahram Sangani, N; Koetsier, J; Mélius, J; Kutmon, M; Ehrhart, F; Evelo, CT; Curfs, LMG; Reutelingsperger, CP; Eijssen, LMT"

A Comprehensive Review on Deep Learning Techniques in Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a serious neurological illness that causes memory loss gradually by destroying brain cells. This deadly brain illness primarily strikes the elderly, impairing their cognitive and bodily abilities until brain shrinkage occurs. Modern techniques are required for an accurate diagnosis of AD. Machine learning has gained attraction in the medical field as a means of determining a person's risk of developing AD in its early stages. One of the most advanced soft computing neural network-based Deep Learning (DL) methodologies has garnered significant interest among researchers in automating early-stage AD diagnosis. Hence, a comprehensive review is necessary to gain insights into DL techniques for the advancement of more effective methods for diagnosing AD. This review explores multiple biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and various DL methodologies, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), The k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN), Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), and Deep Belief Networks (DBN), which have been employed for automating the early diagnosis of AD. Moreover, the unique contributions of this review include the classification of ATN biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), systemic description of diverse DL algorithms for early AD assessment, along with a discussion of widely utilized online datasets such as ADNI, OASIS, etc. Additionally, this review provides perspectives on future trends derived from critical evaluation of each variant of DL techniques across different modalities, dataset sources, AUC values, and accuracies.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Machine learning; Neurodegenerative disorder,,"Mahavar, A; Patel, A; Patel, A"
A machine learning contest enhances automated freezing of gait detection and reveals time-of-day effects.,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating problem that markedly impairs the mobility and independence of 38-65% of people with Parkinson's disease. During a FOG episode, patients report that their feet are suddenly and inexplicably ""glued"" to the floor. The lack of a widely applicable, objective FOG detection method obstructs research and treatment. To address this problem, we organized a 3-month machine-learning contest, inviting experts from around the world to develop wearable sensor-based FOG detection algorithms. 1,379 teams from 83 countries submitted 24,862 solutions. The winning solutions demonstrated high accuracy, high specificity, and good precision in FOG detection, with strong correlations to gold-standard references. When applied to continuous 24/7 data, the solutions revealed previously unobserved patterns in daily living FOG occurrences. This successful endeavor underscores the potential of machine learning contests to rapidly engage AI experts in addressing critical medical challenges and provides a promising means for objective FOG quantification.",2024,,"Machine Learning; Humans; Gait; Algorithms; Parkinson Disease; Wearable Electronic Devices; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Male; Female","Salomon, A; Gazit, E; Ginis, P; Urazalinov, B; Takoi, H; Yamaguchi, T; Goda, S; Lander, D; Lacombe, J; Sinha, AK; Nieuwboer, A; Kirsch, LC; Holbrook, R; Manor, B; Hausdorff, JM"
Automated free speech analysis reveals distinct markers of Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.,"Dementia can disrupt how people experience and describe events as well as their own role in them. Alzheimer's disease (AD) compromises the processing of entities expressed by nouns, while behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) entails a depersonalized perspective with increased third-person references. Yet, no study has examined whether these patterns can be captured in connected speech via natural language processing tools. To tackle such gaps, we asked 96 participants (32 AD patients, 32 bvFTD patients, 32 healthy controls) to narrate a typical day of their lives and calculated the proportion of nouns, verbs, and first- or third-person markers (via part-of-speech and morphological tagging). We also extracted objective properties (frequency, phonological neighborhood, length, semantic variability) from each content word. In our main study (with 21 AD patients, 21 bvFTD patients, and 21 healthy controls), we used inferential statistics and machine learning for group-level and subject-level discrimination. The above linguistic features were correlated with patients' scores in tests of general cognitive status and executive functions. We found that, compared with HCs, (i) AD (but not bvFTD) patients produced significantly fewer nouns, (ii) bvFTD (but not AD) patients used significantly more third-person markers, and (iii) both patient groups produced more frequent words. Machine learning analyses showed that these features identified individuals with AD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.71). A generalizability test, with a model trained on the entire main study sample and tested on hold-out samples (11 AD patients, 11 bvFTD patients, 11 healthy controls), showed even better performance, with AUCs of 0.76 and 0.83 for AD and bvFTD, respectively. No linguistic feature was significantly correlated with cognitive test scores in either patient group. These results suggest that specific cognitive traits of each disorder can be captured automatically in connected speech, favoring interpretability for enhanced syndrome characterization, diagnosis, and monitoring.",2024,,Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; Speech; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Biomarkers; Natural Language Processing; Machine Learning; Neuropsychological Tests; Executive Function,"Lopes da Cunha, P; Ruiz, F; Ferrante, F; Sterpin, LF; Ibáñez, A; Slachevsky, A; Matallana, D; Martínez, Á; Hesse, E; García, AM"

Biomarker Identification for Gender Specificity of Alzheimer's Disease Based on the Glial Transcriptome Profiles.,"Many sex-specific biomarkers have been recently revealed in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, cerebral glial cells were rarely reported. This study analyzed 220,095 single-nuclei transcriptomes from the frontal cortex of thirty-three AD individuals in the GEO database. Sex-specific Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified in glial cells, including 243 in astrocytes, 1,154 in microglia, and 572 in oligodendrocytes. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation analyses and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed functional concentration in synaptic, neural, and hormone-related pathways. Protein-protein interaction network (PPI) identified MT3, CALM2, DLG2, KCND2, PAKACB, CAMK2D, and NLGN4Y in astrocytes, TREM2, FOS, APOE, APP, and NLGN4Y in microglia, and GRIN2A, ITPR2, GNAS, and NLGN4Y in oligodendrocytes as key genes. NLGN4Y was the only gene shared by the three glia and was identified as the biomarker for the gender specificity of AD. Gene-transcription factor (TF)-miRNA coregulatory network identified key regulators for NLGN4Y and its target TCMs. Ecklonia kurome Okam (Kunbu) and Herba Ephedrae (Mahuang) were identified, and the effects of the active ingredients on AD were displayed. Finally, enrichment analysis of Kunbu and Mahuang suggested that they might act as therapeutic candidates for gender specificity of AD.",2024,,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Transcriptome; Female; Neuroglia; Male; Biomarkers,"Liu, H; Yang, H; Liu, S; Li, S; Yang, W; Ayesha, A; Tan, X; Jiang, C; Liu, Y; Xie, L"
Probing latent brain dynamics in Alzheimer's disease via recurrent neural network.,"The impairment of cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clearly correlated to abnormal changes in cortical rhythm. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate how network structure and dynamical characteristics alter their abnormal changes in cortical rhythm. To that end, biological data of AD and normal participates are collected. By extracting the energy characteristics of different sub-bands in EEG signals, we find that the rhythm of AD patients is special particularly in theta and alpha bands. The cortical rhythm of normal state is mainly at alpha band, while that of AD state shift to the theta band. Furthermore, recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained to explore the rhythm formation and transformation between two neural states from the perspective view of neurocomputation. It is found that the neural coupling strength decreases significantly under AD state when compared with normal state, which weakens the ability of information transmission in AD state. Besides, the low-dimensional properties of RNN are obtained. By analyzing the relationship between the cortical rhythm transition and the low-dimensional trajectory, it is concluded that the low-dimensional trajectory update is slower and the communication cost is higher in AD state, which explains the abnormal synchronization of AD brain network. Our work reveals the causes for the formation of abnormal brain synchronous functional network status, which may expand our understanding of the mechanism of cognitive impairment in AD and provide an EEG biomarker for early AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Dynamics; Mechanism; RNN,,"Li, T; Wang, J; Li, S; Li, K"
Three dimensional and four dimensional live imaging to study mechanisms of progressive neurodegeneration.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are complex and progressive, posing challenges to their study and understanding. Recent advances in microscopy imaging technologies have enabled the exploration of neurons in three spatial dimensions (3D) over time (4D). When applied to 3D cultures, tissues, or animals, these technologies can provide valuable insights into the dynamic and spatial nature of neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on the use of imaging techniques and neurodegenerative disease models to study neurodegeneration in 4D. Imaging techniques such as confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy, miniscope imaging, light sheet microscopy, and robotic microscopy offer powerful tools to visualize and analyze neuronal changes over time in 3D tissue. Application of these technologies to in vitro models of neurodegeneration such as mouse organotypic culture systems and human organoid models provide versatile platforms to study neurodegeneration in a physiologically relevant context. Additionally, use of 4D imaging in vivo, including in mouse and zebrafish models of neurodegenerative diseases, allows for the investigation of early dysfunction and behavioral changes associated with neurodegeneration. We propose that these studies have the power to overcome the limitations of two-dimensional monolayer neuronal cultures and pave the way for improved understanding of the dynamics of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease; ayotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; biosensors; fluorescence microscopy; light sheet; neurodegenerative disease; neurodegenerative disease models; organoids; robotic microscopy; two photon,,"Linsley, JW; Reisine, T; Finkbeiner, S"
"Convergent Neuroimaging and Molecular Signatures in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: A Data-Driven Meta-Analysis with N = 3,118.","The current study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility to regional brain atrophy and its biological mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted data-driven meta-analyses to combine 3,118 structural magnetic resonance images from three datasets to obtain robust atrophy patterns. Then we introduced a set of radiogenomic analyses to investigate the biological basis of the atrophy patterns in AD. Our results showed that the hippocampus and amygdala exhibit the most severe atrophy, followed by the temporal, frontal, and occipital lobes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The extent of atrophy in MCI was less severe than that in AD. A series of biological processes related to the glutamate signaling pathway, cellular stress response, and synapse structure and function were investigated through gene set enrichment analysis.

Fine hippocampal morphology analysis with a multi-dataset cross-sectional study on 2911 subjects.,"CA1 subfield and subiculum of the hippocampus contain a series of dentate bulges, which are also called hippocampus dentation (HD). There have been several studies demonstrating an association between HD and brain disorders. Such as the number of hippocampal dentation correlates with temporal lobe epilepsy. And epileptic hippocampus have a lower number of dentation compared to contralateral hippocampus. However, most studies rely on subjective assessment by manual searching and counting in HD areas, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to process large amounts of samples. And to date, only one objective method for quantifying HD has been proposed. Therefore, to fill this gap, we developed an automated and objective method to quantify HD and explore its relationship with neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we performed a fine-scale morphological characterization of HD in 2911 subjects from four different cohorts of ADNI, PPMI, HCP, and IXI to quantify and explore differences between them in MR T1w images. The results showed that the degree of right hippocampal dentation are lower in patients with Alzheimer's disease than samples in mild cognitive impairment or cognitively normal, whereas this change is not significant in Parkinson's disease progression. The innovation of this paper that we propose a quantitative, robust, and fully automated method. These methodological innovation and corresponding results delineated above constitute the significance and novelty of our study. What's more, the proposed method breaks through the limitations of manual labeling and is the first to quantitatively measure and compare HD in four different brain populations including thousands of subjects. These findings revealed new morphological patterns in the hippocampal dentation, which can help with subsequent fine-scale hippocampal morphology research.",2024,Automatic quantification; Hippocampal dentation; Hippocampus; Morphology; Neurodegenerative disease,,"Yang, Q; Chen, G; Yang, Z; Raviv, TR; Gao, Y"
Automated deep learning segmentation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease brain sections using a proprietary software.,"Neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) relies on semiquantitative analysis of phosphorylated tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs), without consideration of lesion heterogeneity in individual cases. We developed a deep learning workflow for automated annotation and segmentation of NPs and NFTs from AT8-immunostained whole slide images (WSIs) of AD brain sections. Fifteen WSIs of frontal cortex from 4 biobanks with varying tissue quality, staining intensity, and scanning formats were analyzed. We established an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven iterative procedure to improve the generation of expert-validated annotation datasets for NPs and NFTs thereby increasing annotation quality by >50%. This strategy yielded an expert-validated annotation database with 5013 NPs and 5143 NFTs. We next trained two U-Net convolutional neural networks for detection and segmentation of NPs or NFTs, achieving high accuracy and consistency (mean Dice similarity coefficient: NPs, 0.77; NFTs, 0.81). The workflow showed high generalization performance across different cases. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for the utilization of proprietary image analysis software (Visiopharm) in the automated deep learning segmentation of NPs and NFTs, demonstrating that AI can significantly improve the annotation quality of complex neuropathological features and enable the creation of highly precise models for identifying these markers in AD brain sections.",2024,Alzheimer disease; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Neuritic plaques; Neurofibrillary tangles; Quantitative histopathology; Tauopathy,,"Ingrassia, L; Boluda, S; Potier, MC; Haïk, S; Jimenez, G; Kar, A; Racoceanu, D; Delatour, B; Stimmer, L"
3-Way hybrid analysis using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive impairment and ultimately death. To select the most effective treatment options, it is crucial to diagnose and classify the disease early, as current treatments can only delay its progression. However, previous research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has had limitations, such as inaccuracies and reliance on a small, unbalanced binary dataset. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the early stages of AD using three multiclass datasets: OASIS, EEG, and ADNI MRI. The research consisted of three phases: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification using hybrid learning techniques. For the OASIS and ADNI MRI datasets, we computed the mean RGB value and used an averaging filter to enhance the images. We balanced and augmented the dataset to increase its size. In the case of the EEG dataset, we applied a band-pass filter for digital filtering to reduce noise and also balanced the dataset using random oversampling. To extract and classify features, we utilized a hybrid technique consisting of four algorithms: AlexNet-MLP, AlexNet-ETC, AlexNet-AdaBoost, and AlexNet-NB. The results showed that the AlexNet-ETC hybrid algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate of 95.32% for the OASIS dataset. In the case of the EEG dataset, the AlexNet-MLP hybrid algorithm outperformed other approaches with the highest accuracy of 97.71%. For the ADNI MRI dataset, the AlexNet-MLP hybrid algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 92.59%. Comparing these results with the current state of the art demonstrates the effectiveness of our findings.",2024,Alzheimer’s; EEG; Early diagnosis; MRI; OASIS,,"Chen, X; Zeng, D; Mehmood, A; Khan, R; Shahid, F; Ibrahim, MM"

A deep learning model for brain segmentation across pediatric and adult populations.,"Automated quantification of brain tissues on MR images has greatly contributed to the diagnosis and follow-up of neurological pathologies across various life stages. However, existing solutions are specifically designed for certain age ranges, limiting their applicability in monitoring brain development from infancy to late adulthood. This retrospective study aims to develop and validate a brain segmentation model across pediatric and adult populations. First, we trained a deep learning model to segment tissues and brain structures using T1-weighted MR images from 390 patients (age range: 2-81 years) across four different datasets. Subsequently, the model was validated on a cohort of 280 patients from six distinct test datasets (age range: 4-90 years). In the initial experiment, the proposed deep learning-based pipeline, icobrain-dl, demonstrated segmentation accuracy comparable to both pediatric and adult-specific models across diverse age groups. Subsequently, we evaluated intra- and inter-scanner variability in measurements of various tissues and structures in both pediatric and adult populations computed by icobrain-dl. Results demonstrated significantly higher reproducibility compared to similar brain quantification tools, including childmetrix, FastSurfer, and the medical device icobrain v5.9 (p-value< 0.01).

Using principal component analysis to determine which vestibular stimuli provide best biomarkers for separating Alzheimer's from mixed Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often mixed with cerebrovascular disease (AD-CVD). Heterogeneity of dementia etiology and the overlapping of neuropathological features of AD and AD-CVD make feature identification of the two challenging. Separation of AD from AD-CVD is important as the optimized treatment for each group may differ. Recent studies using vestibular responses recorded from electrovestibulography (EVestG™) have offered promising results for separating these two pathologies. An EVestG measurement records responses to several different physical stimuli (called tilts). In previous research, the number of EVestG features from different tilts was selected based on physiological intuition to classify AD from AD-CVD. As the number of potential characteristic features from all tilts can be very large, in this study, we used an algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) to rank the most effective vestibular stimuli for differentiating AD from AD-CVD. Analyses were performed on the EVestG signals of 28 individuals with AD and 24 with AD-CVD. The results of this study showed that tilts simulating the otolithic organs (utricle and saccule) generated the most characteristic features for separating AD from AD-CVD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Automated tilt selection; Cerebrovascular symptomatology; Electrovestibulography; Principal component analysis (PCA),,"Marzban, S; Dastgheib, Z; Lithgow, B; Moussavi, Z"
Harmonizing three-dimensional MRI using pseudo-warping field guided GAN.,"In pursuit of cultivating automated models for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to aid in diagnostics, an escalating demand for extensive, multisite, and heterogeneous brain imaging datasets has emerged. This potentially introduces biased outcomes when directly applied for subsequent analysis. Researchers have endeavored to address this issue by pursuing the harmonization of MRIs. However, most existing image-based harmonization methods for MRI are tailored for 2D slices, which may introduce inter-slice variations when they are combined into a 3D volume. In this study, we aim to resolve inconsistencies between slices by introducing a pseudo-warping field. This field is created randomly and utilized to transform a slice into an artificially warped subsequent slice. The objective of this pseudo-warping field is to ensure that generators can consistently harmonize adjacent slices to another domain, without being affected by the varying content present in different slices.

Robot-based solution for helping Alzheimer patients.,"Alzheimer's is a progressive and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired daily functioning. It is an irreversible brain disease that destroys memory, thinking, and the ability to carry out daily activities. It poses significant challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Modern societies are trying to enhance the quality of people's lives, including Alzheimer's patients. In this study, we explored the potential of social robots to provide emotional support, improve cognitive function, and facilitate communication among Alzheimer's patients. This was achieved by initiating conversations on various topics such as family, relationships, and daily activities. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing a novel and well-organized framework for building an Alzheimer's care robot. Further, this study enriches the literature by introducing the Alzheimer Care Companion Robot (ACCR), designed to identify Alzheimer's patients. The ACCR initiates conversations in the native Arab-Kuwaiti dialect, displaying relevant memories through images and videos on its screen to assist in memory recall based on the individuals' life experiences. The proposed ACCR consists of 271 conversations belonging to three main categories: active, proactive, and graphical user interface (GUI) dialogs comprising 112 dialogs, 109 dialogs, and 50 dialogs for active, proactive, and GUI, respectively. The experimental result illustrated the success of the proposed solution.",2024,"Artificial intelligence, Alzheimer care companion robot, Kuwait dialect; Robotics",Alzheimer Disease; Robotics; Humans,"Faisal, M; Alharbi, A; Alhamadi, A; Almutairi, S; Alenezi, S; Alsulaili, A; Khan, M; Khan, F"
Prediction of Alzheimer's disease stages based on ResNet-Self-attention architecture with Bayesian optimization and best features selection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative illness that impairs cognition, function, and behavior by causing irreversible damage to multiple brain areas, including the hippocampus. The suffering of the patients and their family members will be lessened with an early diagnosis of AD. The automatic diagnosis technique is widely required due to the shortage of medical experts and eases the burden of medical staff. The automatic artificial intelligence (AI)-based computerized method can help experts achieve better diagnosis accuracy and precision rates. This study proposes a new automated framework for AD stage prediction based on the ResNet-Self architecture and Fuzzy Entropy-controlled Path-Finding Algorithm (FEcPFA). A data augmentation technique has been utilized to resolve the dataset imbalance issue. In the next step, we proposed a new deep-learning model based on the self-attention module. A ResNet-50 architecture is modified and connected with a self-attention block for important information extraction. The hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO) and then utilized to train the model, which was subsequently employed for feature extraction. The self-attention extracted features were optimized using the proposed FEcPFA. The best features were selected using FEcPFA and passed to the machine learning classifiers for the final classification. The experimental process utilized a publicly available MRI dataset and achieved an improved accuracy of 99.9%. The results were compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, demonstrating the improvement of the proposed framework in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; MRI; convolutional neural network; deep learning; fuzzy entropy; optimization; self-attention,,"Yaqoob, N; Khan, MA; Masood, S; Albarakati, HM; Hamza, A; Alhayan, F; Jamel, L; Masood, A"

Genetic-based patient stratification in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows a high pathological and symptomatological heterogeneity. To study this heterogeneity, we have developed a patient stratification technique based on one of the most significant risk factors for the development of AD: genetics. We addressed this challenge by including network biology concepts, mapping genetic variants data into a brain-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and obtaining individualized PPI scores that we then used as input for a clustering technique. We then phenotyped each obtained cluster regarding genetics, sociodemographics, biomarkers, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, and neurocognitive assessments. We found three clusters defined mainly by genetic variants found in MAPT, APP, and APOE, considering known variants associated with AD and other neurodegenerative disease genetic architectures. Profiling of these clusters revealed minimal variation in AD symptoms and pathology, suggesting different biological mechanisms may activate the neurodegeneration and pathobiological patterns behind AD and result in similar clinical and pathological presentations, even a shared disease diagnosis. Lastly, our research highlighted MAPT, APP, and APOE as key genes where these genetic distinctions manifest, suggesting them as potential targets for personalized drug development strategies to address each AD subgroup individually.",2024,,Alzheimer Disease; Humans; tau Proteins; Apolipoproteins E; Positron-Emission Tomography; Male; Female; Aged; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Protein Interaction Maps; Biomarkers; Brain,"Hernández-Lorenzo, L; García-Gutiérrez, F; Solbas-Casajús, A; Corrochano, S; Matías-Guiu, JA; Ayala, JL"

Impaired language in Alzheimer's disease: A comparison between English and Persian implicates content-word frequency rather than the noun-verb distinction.,"This study challenges the conventional psycholinguistic view that the distinction between nouns and verbs is pivotal in understanding language impairments in neurological disorders. Traditional views link frontal brain region damage with verb processing deficits and posterior temporoparietal damage with noun difficulties. However, this perspective is contested by findings from patients with Alzheimer's disease (pwAD), who show impairments in both word classes despite their typical temporoparietal atrophy. Notably, pwAD tend to use semantically lighter verbs in their speech than healthy individuals. By examining English-speaking pwAD and comparing them with Persian-speaking pwAD, this research aims to demonstrate that language impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) stem from the distributional properties of words within a language rather than distinct neural processing networks for nouns and verbs. We propose that the primary deficit in AD language production is an overreliance on high-frequency words. English has a set of particularly high-frequency verbs that surpass most nouns in usage frequency. Since pwAD tend to use high-frequency words, the byproduct of this word distribution in the English language would be an over-usage of high-frequency verbs. In contrast, Persian features complex verbs with an overall distribution lacking extremely high-frequency verbs like those found in English. As a result, we hypothesize that Persian-speaking pwAD would not have a bias toward the overuse of high-frequency verbs. We analyzed language samples from 95 English-speaking pwAD and 91 healthy controls, along with 27 Persian-speaking pwAD and 27 healthy controls. Employing uniform automated natural language processing methods, we measured the usage rates of nouns, verbs, and word frequencies across both cohorts. Our findings showed that English-speaking pwAD use higher-frequency verbs than healthy individuals, a pattern not mirrored by Persian-speaking pwAD. Crucially, we found a significant interaction between the frequencies of verbs used by English and Persian speakers with and without AD. Moreover, regression models that treated noun and verb frequencies as separate predictors did not outperform models that considered overall word frequency alone in classifying AD. In conclusion, this study suggests that language abnormalities among English-speaking pwAD reflect the unique distributional properties of words in English rather than a universal noun-verb class distinction. Beyond offering a new understanding of language abnormalities in AD, the study highlights the critical need for further investigation across diverse languages to deepen our insight into the mechanisms of language impairments in neurological disorders.",2024,,,"Sanati, M; Bayat, S; Panahi, MM; Khodadadi, A; Rezaee, S; Ghasimi, M; Besharat, S; Fooladi, ZM; Dooghaee, MA; Taheri, MS; Dickerson, BC; Goldberg, A; Rezaii, N"
Fiber-in-tube SPME-CapLC-MS/MS method to determine Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from Alzheimer's patients.,"Mass spectrometry is characterized by its high sensitivity, ability to measure very low analyte concentrations, specificity to distinguish between closely related compounds, availability to generate high-throughput methods for screening, and high multiplexing capacity. This technique has been used as a platform to analyze fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. However, more effective sample preparation procedures, preferably antibody-independent, and more automated mass spectrometry platforms with improved sensitivity, chromatographic separation, and high throughput are needed for this purpose. This short communication discusses the development of a fiber-in-tube SPME-CapLC-MS/MS method to determine Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from Alzheimer's disease patients. To obtain the fiber-in-tube SPME capillary, we longitudinally packed 22 nitinol fibers coated with a zwitterionic polymeric ionic liquid into the same length of the PEEK tube. In addition, this communication compares this fiber-in-tube SPME method with the conventional HPLC scale (HPLC-MS/MS) and when directly coupled to CapESI-MS/MS without chromatographic separation, and, as a case study, discusses the benefits and challenges inherent in miniaturizing the flow scale of the sample preparation technique (fiber-in-tube SPME) to the CapLC-MS/MS system.

Sleep-Deep-Learner is taught sleep-wake scoring by the end-user to complete each record in their style.,"Sleep-wake scoring is a time-consuming, tedious but essential component of clinical and preclinical sleep research. Sleep scoring is even more laborious and challenging in rodents due to the smaller EEG amplitude differences between states and the rapid state transitions which necessitate scoring in shorter epochs. Although many automated rodent sleep scoring methods exist, they do not perform as well when scoring new datasets, especially those which involve changes in the EEG/EMG profile. Thus, manual scoring by expert scorers remains the gold standard. Here we take a different approach to this problem by using a neural network to accelerate the scoring of expert scorers. Sleep-Deep-Learner creates a bespoke deep convolution neural network model for individual electroencephalographic or local-field-potential (LFP) records via transfer learning of GoogLeNet, by learning from a small subset of manual scores of each EEG/LFP record as provided by the end-user. Sleep-Deep-Learner then automates scoring of the remainder of the EEG/LFP record. A novel REM sleep scoring correction procedure further enhanced accuracy. Sleep-Deep-Learner reliably scores EEG and LFP data and retains sleep-wake architecture in wild-type mice, in sleep induced by the hypnotic zolpidem, in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in a genetic knock-down study, when compared to manual scoring. Sleep-Deep-Learner reduced manual scoring time to 1/12. Since Sleep-Deep-Learner uses transfer learning on each independent recording, it is not biased by previously scored existing datasets. Thus, we find Sleep-Deep-Learner performs well when used on signals altered by a drug, disease model, or genetic modification.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease model; automated sleep–wake scoring; basic sleep research; deep learning; hypnotics; in vivo pharmacology; transfer learning; translational sleep research,,"Katsuki, F; Spratt, TJ; Brown, RE; Basheer, R; Uygun, DS"

"Performance Evaluation of Deep, Shallow and Ensemble Machine Learning Methods for the Automated Classification of Alzheimer's Disease.","Artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches are crucial in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for various medical applications. Their ability to quickly and accurately learn from complex data is remarkable. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promising results in accurately classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its related cognitive states, Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), along with the healthy conditions known as Cognitively Normal (CN). This offers valuable insights into disease progression and diagnosis. However, certain traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers perform equally well or even better than DL models, requiring less training data. This is particularly valuable in CAD in situations with limited labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose an ensemble classifier based on ML models for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.52%. This represents a 3-5% improvement over the best individual classifier. We evaluated popular ML classifiers for AD classification under both data-scarce and data-rich conditions using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies datasets.

Comprehensive Lipidomic Automation Workflow using Large Language Models.,"Lipidomics generates large data that makes manual annotation and interpretation challenging. Lipid chemical and structural diversity with structural isomers further complicates annotation. Although, several commercial and open-source software for targeted lipid identification exists, it lacks automated method generation workflows and integration with statistical and bioinformatics tools. We have developed the Comprehensive Lipidomic Automated Workflow (CLAW) platform with integrated workflow for parsing, detailed statistical analysis and lipid annotations based on custom multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) precursor and product ion pair transitions. CLAW contains several modules including identification of carbon-carbon double bond position(s) in unsaturated lipids when combined with ozone electrospray ionization (OzESI)-MRM methodology. To demonstrate the utility of the automated workflow in CLAW, large-scale lipidomics data was collected with traditional and OzESI-MRM profiling on biological and non-biological samples. Specifically, a total of 1497 transitions organized into 10 MRM-based mass spectrometry methods were used to profile lipid droplets isolated from different brain regions of 18-24 month-old Alzheimer's disease mice and age-matched wild-type controls. Additionally, triacyclglycerols (TGs) profiles with carbon-carbon double bond specificity were generated from canola oil samples using OzESI-MRM profiling. We also developed an integrated language user interface with large language models using artificially intelligent (AI) agents that permits users to interact with the CLAW platform using a chatbot terminal to perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses. We envision CLAW pipeline to be used in high-throughput lipid structural identification tasks aiding users to generate automated lipidomics workflows ranging from data acquisition to AI agent-based bioinformatic analysis.",2024,,,"Beveridge, C; Iyer, S; Randolph, CE; Muhoberac, M; Manchanda, P; Clingenpeel, AC; Tichy, S; Chopra, G"
Age-Related Brain Atrophy and the Positive Effects of Behavioral Enrichment in Middle-Aged Beagles.,"Aging dogs serve as a valuable preclinical model for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to their natural age-related development of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, human-like metabolism, and large brains that are ideal for studying structural brain aging trajectories from serial neuroimaging. Here we examined the effects of chronic treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus or the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-inhibiting compound Q134R on age-related canine brain atrophy from a longitudinal study in middle-aged beagles (36 females, 7 males) undergoing behavioral enrichment. Annual MRI was analyzed using modern, automated techniques for region-of-interest-based and voxel-based volumetric assessments. We found that the frontal lobe showed accelerated atrophy with age, while the caudate nucleus remained relatively stable. Remarkably, the hippocampus increased in volume in all dogs. None of these changes were influenced by tacrolimus or Q134R treatment. Our results suggest that behavioral enrichment can prevent atrophy and increase the volume of the hippocampus but does not prevent aging-associated prefrontal cortex atrophy.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Q134R; amyloid; beagle; calcineurin; neurodegeneration; prevention; tacrolimus,"Animals; Dogs; Female; Atrophy; Male; Aging; Brain; Tacrolimus; Behavior, Animal; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Noche, JA; Radhakrishnan, H; Ubele, MF; Boaz, K; Mefford, JL; Jones, ED; van Rooyen, HY; Perpich, JA; McCarty, K; Meacham, B; Smiley, J; Bembenek Bailey, SA; Puskás, LG; Powell, DK; Sordo, L; Phelan, MJ; Norris, CM; Head, E; Stark, CEL"
Towards a multimodal neuroimaging-based risk score for mild cognitive impairment by combining clinical studies with a large (N>37000) population-based study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia, leading to a decline in memory, reasoning, and social skills. While numerous studies have investigated the genetic risk factors associated with AD, less attention has been given to identifying a brain imaging-based measure of AD risk. This study introduces a novel approach to assess mild cognitive impairment MCI, as a stage before AD, risk using neuroimaging data, referred to as a brain-wide risk score (BRS), which incorporates multimodal brain imaging. To begin, we first categorized participants from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)-3 cohort into two groups: controls (CN) and individuals with MCI. Next, we computed structure and functional imaging features from all the OASIS data as well as all the UK Biobank data. For resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we computed functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices using fully automated spatially constrained independent component analysis. For structural MRI data we computed gray matter (GM) segmentation maps. We then evaluated the similarity between each participant's neuroimaging features from the UK Biobank and the difference in the average of those features between CN individuals and those with MCI, which we refer to as the brain-wide risk score (BRS). Both GM and FNC features were utilized in determining the BRS. We first evaluated the differences in the distribution of the BRS for CN vs MCI within the OASIS-3 (using OASIS-3 as the reference group). Next, we evaluated the BRS in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (using OASIS-3 as the reference group), showing that the BRS can differentiate MCI from CN in an independent data set. Subsequently, using the sMRI BRS, we identified 10 distinct subgroups and similarly, we identified another set of 10 subgroups using the FNC BRS. For sMRI and FNC we observed results that mutually validate each other, with certain aspects being complementary. For the unimodal analysis, sMRI provides greater differentiation between MCI and CN individuals than the fMRI data, consistent with prior work. Additionally, by utilizing a multimodal BRS approach, which combines both GM and FNC assessments, we identified two groups of subjects using the multimodal BRS scores. One group exhibits high MCI risk with both negative GM and FNC BRS, while the other shows low MCI risk with both positive GM and FNC BRS. Moreover, in the UKBB we have 46 participants diagnosed with AD showed FNC and GM patterns similar to those in high-risk groups, defined in both unimodal and multimodal BRS. Finally, to ensure the reproducibility of our findings, we conducted a validation analysis using the ADNI as an additional reference dataset and repeated the above analysis. The results were consistently replicated across different reference groups, highlighting the potential of FNC and sMRI-based BRS in early Alzheimer's detection.",2024,Mild cognitive impairment; brain risk score; functional network connectivity; gray matter; multimodal neuroimaging,,"Zendehrouh, E; Sendi, MSE; Abrol, A; Batta, I; Hassanzadeh, R; Calhoun, VD"
Can white matter hyperintensities based Fazekas visual assessment scales inform about Alzheimer's disease pathology in the population?,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are considered hallmark features of cerebral small vessel disease and have recently been linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Their distinct spatial distributions, namely periventricular versus deep WMH, may differ by underlying age-related and pathobiological processes contributing to cognitive decline. We aimed to identify the spatial patterns of WMH using the 4-scale Fazekas visual assessment and explore their differential association with age, vascular health, Alzheimer's imaging markers, namely amyloid and tau burden, and cognition.

The Chronic Effects of a Single Low-Intensity Blast Exposure on Phosphoproteome Networks and Cognitive Function Influenced by Mutant Tau Overexpression.,"Blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) is a pressing concern for veterans and civilians exposed to explosive devices. Affected personnel may have increased risk for long-term cognitive decline and developing tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease-related disorders (ADRD) or frontal-temporal dementia (FTD). The goal of this study was to identify the effect of BINT on molecular networks and their modulation by mutant tau in transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing the human tau P301L mutation (rTg4510) linked to FTD or non-carriers. The primary focus was on the phosphoproteome because of the prominent role of hyperphosphorylation in neurological disorders. Discrimination learning was assessed following injury in the subsequent 6 weeks, using the automated home-cage monitoring CognitionWall platform. At 40 days post injury, label-free phosphoproteomics was used to evaluate molecular networks in the frontal cortex of mice. Utilizing a weighted peptide co-expression network analysis (WpCNA) approach, we identified phosphopeptide networks tied to associative learning and mossy-fiber pathways and those which predicted learning outcomes. Phosphorylation levels in these networks were inversely related to learning and linked to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive decline, and dementia including Atp6v1a and Itsn1. Low-intensity blast (LIB) selectively increased pSer262tau in rTg4510, a site implicated in initiating tauopathy. Additionally, individual and group level analyses identified the Arhgap33 phosphopeptide as an indicator of BINT-induced cognitive impairment predominantly in rTg4510 mice. This study unveils novel interactions between ADRD genetic susceptibility, BINT, and cognitive decline, thus identifying dysregulated pathways as targets in potential precision-medicine focused therapeutics to alleviate the disease burden among those affected by BINT.",2024,WpCNA; discrimination-learning index; eigenpeptides; label-free DIA-PASEF quantitative proteomics; low-intensity open-field blast; phosphopeptides; phosphoproteomic profiling,"Mice; Humans; Animals; tau Proteins; Frontotemporal Dementia; Phosphopeptides; Tauopathies; Mice, Transgenic; Cognition; Disease Models, Animal","Jackson, M; Chen, S; Nguyen, TT; Siedhoff, HR; Balderrama, A; Zuckerman, A; Li, R; Greenlief, CM; Cole, G; Frautschy, SA; Cui, J; Gu, Z"
A deeply supervised adaptable neural network for diagnosis and classification of Alzheimer's severity using multitask feature extraction.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent form of dementia, which is a gradual condition that begins with mild memory loss and progresses to difficulties communicating and responding to the environment. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques have resulted in large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data, leading to an increased interest in using deep learning for the early diagnosis and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease. This study uses machine learning (ML) methods to determine the severity level of Alzheimer's disease using MRI images, where the dataset consists of four levels of severity. A hybrid of 12 feature extraction methods is used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease severity, and six traditional machine learning methods are applied, including decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, linear discrimination analysis, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble learning methods. During training, optimization is performed to obtain the best solution for each classifier. Additionally, a CNN model is trained using a machine learning system algorithm to identify specific patterns. The accuracy of the Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Linear discrimination classifier, Decision tree, Ensembled learning, and presented CNN architecture are 67.5%, 72.3%, 74.5%, 65.6%, 62.4%, 73.8% and, 95.3%, respectively. Based on the results, the presented CNN approach outperforms other traditional machine learning methods to find Alzheimer severity.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Bayes Theorem; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Support Vector Machine","Ahmadi, M; Javaheri, D; Khajavi, M; Danesh, K; Hur, J"
Uncovering Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease from Graphical Modeling of the Tau Spatiotemporal Topography.,"Growing evidence from post-mortem and in vivo studies have demonstrated the substantial variability of tau pathology spreading patterns in Alzheimer's disease(AD). Automated tools for characterizing the heterogeneity of tau pathology will enable a more accurate understanding of the disease and help the development of targeted treatment. In this paper, we propose a Reeb graph representation of tau pathology topography on cortical surfaces using tau PET imaging data. By comparing the spatial and temporal coherence of the Reeb graph representation across subjects, we can build a directed graph to represent the distribution of tau topography over a population, which naturally facilitates the discovery of spatiotemporal subtypes of tau pathology with graph-based clustering. In our experiments, we conducted extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art event-based model on synthetic and large-scale tau PET imaging data from ADNI3 and A4 studies. We demonstrated that our proposed method can more robustly achieve the subtyping of tau pathology with clear clinical significance and demonstrated superior generalization performance than event-based model.",2023,Heterogeneity; Reeb graph; Tau pathology,,"Yue, J; Shi, Y"
VentRa: distinguishing frontotemporal dementia from psychiatric disorders.,"The volume of the lateral ventricles is a reliable and sensitive indicator of brain atrophy and disease progression in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In this study, we validate our previously developed automated tool using ventricular features (known as VentRa) for the classification of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia versus a mixed cohort of neurodegenerative, vascular and psychiatric disorders from a clinically representative independent dataset. Lateral ventricles were segmented for 1110 subjects-14 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 30 other frontotemporal dementia, 70 Lewy body disease, 898 Alzheimer's disease, 62 vascular brain injury and 36 primary psychiatric disorder from the publicly accessible National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset to assess the performance of VentRa. Using ventricular features to discriminate behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia subjects from primary psychiatric disorders, VentRa achieved an accuracy rate of 84%, a sensitivity rate of 71% and a specificity rate of 89%. VentRa was able to identify behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia from a mixed age-matched cohort (i.e. other frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body disease, Alzheimer's disease, vascular brain injury and primary psychiatric disorders) and to correctly classify other disorders as 'not compatible with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia' with a specificity rate of 83%. The specificity rates against each of the other individual cohorts were 80% for other frontotemporal dementia, 83% for Lewy body disease, 83% for Alzheimer's disease, 84% for vascular brain injury and 89% for primary psychiatric disorders. VentRa is a robust and generalizable tool with potential usefulness for improving the diagnostic certainty of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, particularly for the differential diagnosis with primary psychiatric disorders.",2024,brain imaging; classification; dementia; frontotemporal dementia; lateral ventricles; psychiatric disorder,,"Manera, AL; Dadar, M; Ducharme, S; Collins, DL"

Utilizing Siamese 4D-AlzNet and Transfer Learning to Identify Stages of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the general form of dementia, leading to a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss due to brain cell damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists in the early identification and prediction of AD patients, determining future risks and benefits for radiologists and doctors to save time and cost. Since deep learning (DL) approaches work well with massive datasets and have recently become helpful for AD detection, there remains an area for improvement in automating detection performance. Present approaches somehow addressed the challenges of limited annotated data samples for binary classification. This contrasts with prior state-of-the-art techniques, which were constrained by their incapacity to capture abstract-level information. In this paper, we proposed a Siamese 4D-AlzNet model comprised of four parallel convolutional neural network (CNN) streams (Five CNN layer blocks) and customized transfer learning models (Frozen VGG-19, Frozen VGG-16, and customized AlexNet). Siamese 4D-AlzNet was vertically and horizontally stored, and the spatial features were passed to the final layer for classification. For experiments, T1-weighted MRI images comprised of four distinct subject classes, normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and AD, have been employed. Our proposed models achieved outstanding accuracy, with a remarkable 95.05% accuracy distinguishing between normal and AD subjects. The performance across remaining binary class pairs consistently exceeded 90%. We thoroughly compared our model with the latest methods using the same dataset as our reference. Our proposed model improved NC-AD and MCI-AD classification accuracy by 2% 7%.",2024,classification; deep learning; late mild cognitive impairment; siamese-4D-AlzNet; transfer learning,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Deep Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Aged; Brain; Female; Male","Mehmood, A; Shahid, F; Khan, R; Ibrahim, MM; Zheng, Z"

EKGDR: An End-to-End Knowledge Graph-Based Method for Computational Drug Repurposing.,"The lengthy and expensive process of developing new drugs from scratch, coupled with a high failure rate, has prompted the emergence of drug repurposing/repositioning as a more efficient and cost-effective approach. This approach involves identifying new therapeutic applications for existing approved drugs, leveraging the extensive drug-related data already gathered. However, the diversity and heterogeneity of data, along with the limited availability of known drug-disease interactions, pose significant challenges to computational drug design. To address these challenges, this study introduces EKGDR, an end-to-end knowledge graph-based approach for computational drug repurposing. EKGDR utilizes the power of a drug knowledge graph, a comprehensive repository of drug-related information that encompasses known drug interactions and various categorization information, as well as structural molecular descriptors of drugs. EKGDR employs graph neural networks, a cutting-edge graph representation learning technique, to embed the drug knowledge graph (nodes and relations) in an end-to-end manner. By doing so, EKGDR can effectively learn the underlying causes (intents) behind drug-disease interactions and recursively aggregate and combine relational messages between nodes along different multihop neighborhood paths (relational paths). This process generates representations of disease and drug nodes, enabling EKGDR to predict the interaction probability for each drug-disease pair in an end-to-end manner. The obtained results demonstrate that EKGDR outperforms previous models in all three evaluation metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.9475), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC = 0.9490), and recall at the top-200 recommendations (Recall@200 = 0.8315). To further validate EKGDR's effectiveness, we evaluated the top-20 candidate drugs suggested for each of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.",2024,,"Drug Repositioning; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Neural Networks, Computer; Knowledge Bases; Drug Interactions","Tayebi, J; BabaAli, B"

Automated detection of Alzheimer's disease: a multi-modal approach with 3D MRI and amyloid PET.,"Recent advances in deep learning and imaging technologies have revolutionized automated medical image analysis, especially in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease through neuroimaging. Despite the availability of various imaging modalities for the same patient, the development of multi-modal models leveraging these modalities remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and evaluating classification models using 2D and 3D MRI images and amyloid PET scans in uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks. Our findings demonstrate that models using volumetric data learn more effective representations than those using only 2D images. Furthermore, integrating multiple modalities enhances model performance over single-modality approaches significantly. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on the OASIS-3 cohort. Additionally, explainability analyses with Grad-CAM indicate that our model focuses on crucial AD-related regions for its predictions, underscoring its potential to aid in understanding the disease's causes.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography,"Castellano, G; Esposito, A; Lella, E; Montanaro, G; Vessio, G"

Diagnosis-Guided Deep Subspace Clustering Association Study for Pathogenetic Markers Identification of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Comparative Atlases.,"The roles of brain region activities and genotypic functions in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. Meanwhile, current imaging genetics methods are difficult to identify potential pathogenetic markers by correlation analysis between brain network and genetic variation. To discover disease-related brain connectome from the specific brain structure and the fine-grained level, based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and human Brainnetome atlases, the functional brain network is first constructed for each subject. Specifically, the upper triangle elements of the functional connectivity matrix are extracted as connectivity features. The clustering coefficient and the average weighted node degree are developed to assess the significance of every brain area. Since the constructed brain network and genetic data are characterized by non-linearity, high-dimensionality, and few subjects, the deep subspace clustering algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the original data. Our multilayer neural network helps capture the non-linear manifolds, and subspace clustering learns pairwise affinities between samples. Moreover, most approaches in neuroimaging genetics are unsupervised learning, neglecting the diagnostic information related to diseases. We presented a label constraint with diagnostic status to instruct the imaging genetics correlation analysis. To this end, a diagnosis-guided deep subspace clustering association (DDSCA) method is developed to discover brain connectome and risk genetic factors by integrating genotypes with functional network phenotypes. Extensive experiments prove that DDSCA achieves superior performance to most association methods and effectively selects disease-relevant genetic markers and brain connectome at the coarse-grained and fine-grained levels.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cluster Analysis; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Connectome; Algorithms; Aged; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Atlases as Topic; Neuroimaging,"Jiao, CN; Shang, J; Li, F; Cui, X; Wang, YL; Gao, YL; Liu, JX"

Reconstructing microvascular network skeletons from 3D images: What is the ground truth?,"Structural changes to microvascular networks are increasingly highlighted as markers of pathogenesis in a wide range of disease, e.g. Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and tumour growth. This has motivated the development of dedicated 3D imaging techniques, alongside the creation of computational modelling frameworks capable of using 3D reconstructed networks to simulate functional behaviours such as blood flow or transport processes. Extraction of 3D networks from imaging data broadly consists of two image processing steps: segmentation followed by skeletonisation. Much research effort has been devoted to segmentation field, and there are standard and widely-applied methodologies for creating and assessing gold standards or ground truths produced by manual annotation or automated algorithms. The Skeletonisation field, however, lacks widely applied, simple to compute metrics for the validation or optimisation of the numerous algorithms that exist to extract skeletons from binary images. This is particularly problematic as 3D imaging datasets increase in size and visual inspection becomes an insufficient validation approach. In this work, we first demonstrate the extent of the problem by applying 4 widely-used skeletonisation algorithms to 3 different imaging datasets. In doing so we show significant variability between reconstructed skeletons of the same segmented imaging dataset. Moreover, we show that such a structural variability propagates to simulated metrics such as blood flow. To mitigate this variability we introduce a new, fast and easy to compute super metric that compares the volume, connectivity, medialness, bifurcation point identification and homology of the reconstructed skeletons to the original segmented data. We then show that such a metric can be used to select the best performing skeletonisation algorithm for a given dataset, as well as to optimise its parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that the super metric can also be used to quickly identify how a particular skeletonisation algorithm could be improved, becoming a powerful tool in understanding the complex implication of small structural changes in a network.",2024,3D Imaging; Blood flow Simulations; Imaging-modelling Pipeline; Microvascular network; Skeletonisation; Uncertainty Quantification,"Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Neoplasms","Walsh, CL; Berg, M; West, H; Holroyd, NA; Walker-Samuel, S; Shipley, RJ"

Assessing Cognitive Workload in Motor Decision-Making through Functional Connectivity Analysis: Towards Early Detection and Monitoring of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, among others, are increasingly prevalent in the global population. The clinical diagnosis of these NDs is based on the detection and characterization of motor and non-motor symptoms. However, when these diagnoses are made, the subjects are often in advanced stages where neuromuscular alterations are frequently irreversible. In this context, we propose a methodology to evaluate the cognitive workload (CWL) of motor tasks involving decision-making processes. CWL is a concept widely used to address the balance between task demand and the subject's available resources to complete that task. In this study, multiple models for motor planning during a motor decision-making task were developed by recording EEG and EMG signals in n=17 healthy volunteers (9 males, 8 females, age 28.66±8.8 years). In the proposed test, volunteers have to make decisions about which hand should be moved based on the onset of a visual stimulus. We computed functional connectivity between the cortex and muscles, as well as among muscles using both corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence. Despite three models being generated, just one of them had strong performance. The results showed two types of motor decision-making processes depending on the hand to move. Moreover, the central processing of decision-making for the left hand movement can be accurately estimated using behavioral measures such as planning time combined with peripheral recordings like EMG signals. The models provided in this study could be considered as a methodological foundation to detect neuromuscular alterations in asymptomatic patients, as well as to monitor the process of a degenerative disease.",2024,cognitive workload; decision-making; functional connectivity; motor planning; neurodegenerative diseases; statistical modeling,"Male; Female; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cerebral Cortex; Muscle, Skeletal; Electromyography; Electroencephalography; Cognition","Cano, LA; Albarracín, AL; Pizá, AG; García-Cena, CE; Fernández-Jover, E; Farfán, FD"
Monitoring Disease Severity of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Single-Channel EEG Data Using Regression Analysis.,"A deviation in the soundness of cognitive health is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and it is important to monitor it early to prevent complicated diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Traditionally, MCI severity is monitored with manual scoring using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In this study, we propose a new MCI severity monitoring algorithm with regression analysis of extracted features of single-channel electro-encephalography (EEG) data by automatically generating severity scores equivalent to MoCA scores. We evaluated both multi-trial and single-trail analysis for the algorithm development. For multi-trial analysis, 590 features were extracted from the prominent event-related potential (ERP) points and corresponding time domain characteristics, and we utilized the lasso regression technique to select the best feature set. The 13 best features were used in the classical regression techniques: multivariate regression (MR), ensemble regression (ER), support vector regression (SVR), and ridge regression (RR). The best results were observed for ER with an RMSE of 1.6 and residual analysis. In single-trial analysis, we extracted a time-frequency plot image from each trial and fed it as an input to the constructed convolutional deep neural network (CNN). This deep CNN model resulted an RMSE of 2.76. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate automated scores for MCI severity equivalent to MoCA from single-channel EEG data with multi-trial and single data.",2024,Montreal cognitive assessment; deep learning; electroencephalography; ensemble regression; event-related potential; mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Regression Analysis; Electroencephalography; Patient Acuity,"Khatun, S; Morshed, BI; Bidelman, GM"

Highly accurate blood test for Alzheimer's disease is similar or superior to clinical cerebrospinal fluid tests.,"With the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying therapies, identifying patients who could benefit from these treatments becomes critical. In this study, we evaluated whether a precise blood test could perform as well as established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Plasma %p-tau217 (ratio of phosporylated-tau217 to non-phosphorylated tau) was analyzed by mass spectrometry in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n = 1,422) and the US Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) cohort (n = 337). Matched CSF samples were analyzed with clinically used and FDA-approved automated immunoassays for Aβ42/40 and p-tau181/Aβ42. The primary and secondary outcomes were detection of brain Aβ or tau pathology, respectively, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the reference standard. Main analyses were focused on individuals with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia), which is the target population for available disease-modifying treatments. Plasma %p-tau217 was clinically equivalent to FDA-approved CSF tests in classifying Aβ PET status, with an area under the curve (AUC) for both between 0.95 and 0.97. Plasma %p-tau217 was generally superior to CSF tests in classification of tau-PET with AUCs of 0.95-0.98. In cognitively impaired subcohorts (BioFINDER-2: n = 720; Knight ADRC: n = 50), plasma %p-tau217 had an accuracy, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 89-90% for Aβ PET and 87-88% for tau PET status, which was clinically equivalent to CSF tests, further improving to 95% using a two-cutoffs approach. Blood plasma %p-tau217 demonstrated performance that was clinically equivalent or superior to clinically used FDA-approved CSF tests in the detection of AD pathology.

Sexual coordination in a whole-brain map of prairie vole pair bonding.,"Sexual bonds are central to the social lives of many species, including humans, and monogamous prairie voles have become the predominant model for investigating such attachments. We developed an automated whole-brain mapping pipeline to identify brain circuits underlying pair-bonding behavior. We identified bonding-related c-Fos induction in 68 brain regions clustered in seven major brain-wide neuronal circuits. These circuits include known regulators of bonding, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular hypothalamus, ventral pallidum, and prefrontal cortex. They also include brain regions previously unknown to shape bonding, such as ventromedial hypothalamus, medial preoptic area, and the medial amygdala, but that play essential roles in bonding-relevant processes, such as sexual behavior, social reward, and territorial aggression. Contrary to some hypotheses, we found that circuits active during mating and bonding were largely sexually monomorphic. Moreover, c-Fos induction across regions was strikingly consistent between members of a pair, with activity best predicted by rates of ejaculation.

Automated discovery of algorithms from data.,"To automate the discovery of new scientific and engineering principles, artificial intelligence must distill explicit rules from experimental data. This has proven difficult because existing methods typically search through the enormous space of possible functions. Here we introduce deep distilling, a machine learning method that does not perform searches but instead learns from data using symbolic essence neural networks and then losslessly condenses the network parameters into a concise algorithm written in computer code. This distilled code, which can contain loops and nested logic, is equivalent to the neural network but is human-comprehensible and orders-of-magnitude more compact. On arithmetic, vision and optimization tasks, the distilled code is capable of out-of-distribution systematic generalization to solve cases orders-of-magnitude larger and more complex than the training data. The distilled algorithms can sometimes outperform human-designed algorithms, demonstrating that deep distilling is able to discover generalizable principles complementary to human expertise.",2024,,,"Blazek, PJ; Venkatesh, K; Lin, MM"
Genome-wide epistasis analysis reveals gene-gene interaction network on an intermediate endophenotype P-tau/Aβ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly worldwide. The exact etiology of AD, particularly its genetic mechanisms, remains incompletely understood. Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which primarily focus on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with main effects, provide limited explanations for the ""missing heritability"" of AD, while there is growing evidence supporting the important role of epistasis. In this study, we performed a genome-wide SNP-SNP interaction detection using a linear regression model and employed multiple GPUs for parallel computing, significantly enhancing the speed of whole-genome analysis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau (P-tau)/amyloid-[Formula: see text] (A[Formula: see text]) ratio was used as a quantitative trait (QT) to enhance statistical power. Age, gender, and clinical diagnosis were included as covariates to control for potential non-genetic factors influencing AD. We identified 961 pairs of statistically significant SNP-SNP interactions, explaining a high-level variance of P-tau/A[Formula: see text] level, all of which exhibited marginal main effects. Additionally, we replicated 432 previously reported AD-related genes and found 11 gene-gene interaction pairs overlapping with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Our findings may contribute to partially explain the ""missing heritability"" of AD. The identified subnetwork may be associated with synaptic dysfunction, Wnt signaling pathway, oligodendrocytes, inflammation, hippocampus, and neuronal cells.",2024,,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Epistasis, Genetic; Endophenotypes; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Genome-Wide Association Study; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments","Zhang, Q; Liu, J; Liu, H; Ao, L; Xi, Y; Chen, D"
Genetic Algorithm for Automated Parameterization of Network Hamiltonian Models of Amyloid Fibril Formation.,"The time scales of long-time atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are typically reported in microseconds, while the time scales for experiments studying the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation are typically reported in minutes or hours. This time scale deficit of roughly 9 orders of magnitude presents a major challenge in the design of computer simulation methods for studying protein aggregation events. Coarse-grained molecular simulations offer a computationally tractable path forward for exploring the molecular mechanism driving the formation of these structures, which are implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and type-II diabetes. Network Hamiltonian models of aggregation are centered around a Hamiltonian function that returns the total energy of a system of aggregating proteins, given the graph structure of the system as an input. In the graph, or network, representation of the system, each protein molecule is represented as a node, and noncovalent bonds between proteins are represented as edges. The parameter, i.e., a set of coefficients that determine the degree to which each topological degree of freedom is favored or disfavored, must be determined for each network Hamiltonian model, and is a well-known technical challenge. The methodology is first demonstrated by beginning with an initial set of randomly parametrized models of low fibril fraction (<5% fibrillar), and evolving to subsequent generations of models, ultimately leading to high fibril fraction models (>70% fibrillar). The methodology is also demonstrated by applying it to optimizing previously published network Hamiltonian models for the 5 key amyloid fibril topologies that have been reported in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The models generated by the AI produced fibril fractions that surpass previously published fibril fractions in 3 of 5 cases, including the most naturally abundant amyloid fibril topology, the ",2024,,Amyloid; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Algorithms; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Grazioli, G; Tao, A; Bhatia, I; Regan, P"
New rabies viral resources for multi-scale neural circuit mapping.,"Comparisons and linkage between multiple imaging scales are essential for neural circuit connectomics. Here, we report 20 new recombinant rabies virus (RV) vectors that we have developed for multi-scale and multi-modal neural circuit mapping tools. Our new RV tools for mesoscale imaging express a range of improved fluorescent proteins. Further refinements target specific neuronal subcellular locations of interest. We demonstrate the discovery power of these new tools including the detection of detailed microstructural changes of rabies-labeled neurons in aging and Alzheimer's disease mouse models, live imaging of neuronal activities using calcium indicators, and automated measurement of infected neurons.

Modeling genotype-protein interaction and correlation for Alzheimer's disease: a multi-omics imaging genetics study.,"Integrating and analyzing multiple omics data sets, including genomics, proteomics and radiomics, can significantly advance researchers' comprehensive understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, current methodologies primarily focus on the main effects of genetic variation and protein, overlooking non-additive effects such as genotype-protein interaction (GPI) and correlation patterns in brain imaging genetics studies. Importantly, these non-additive effects could contribute to intermediate imaging phenotypes, finally leading to disease occurrence. In general, the interaction between genetic variations and proteins, and their correlations are two distinct biological effects, and thus disentangling the two effects for heritable imaging phenotypes is of great interest and need. Unfortunately, this issue has been largely unexploited. In this paper, to fill this gap, we propose $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{G}$enotype-$\textbf{P}$rotein $\textbf{I}$nteraction and $\textbf{C}$orrelation disentangling method ($\textbf{MT-GPIC}$) to identify GPI and extract correlation patterns between them. To ensure stability and interpretability, we use novel and off-the-shelf penalties to identify meaningful genetic risk factors, as well as exploit the interconnectedness of different brain regions. Additionally, since computing GPI poses a high computational burden, we develop a fast optimization strategy for solving MT-GPIC, which is guaranteed to converge. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set show that MT-GPIC achieves higher correlation coefficients and classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our approach could effectively identify interpretable phenotype-related GPI and correlation patterns in high-dimensional omics data sets. These findings not only enhance the diagnostic accuracy but also contribute valuable insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of AD.",2024,biomarker identification; genotype–protein interaction and correlation; multi-omics brain imaging genetics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Multiomics; Genotype; Neuroimaging; Phenotype; Brain,"Zhang, J; Ma, Z; Yang, Y; Guo, L; Du, L"

Aβ-Aggregation-Generated Blue Autofluorescence Illuminates Senile Plaques as well as Complex Blood and Vascular Pathologies in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Senile plaque blue autofluorescence was discovered around 40 years ago, however, its impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has not been fully examined. We analyzed senile plaques with immunohistochemistry and fluorescence imaging on AD brain sections and also Aβ aggregation in vitro. In DAPI or Hoechst staining, the nuclear blue fluorescence could only be correctly assigned after subtracting the blue plaque autofluorescence. The flower-like structures wrapping dense-core blue fluorescence formed by cathepsin D staining could not be considered central-nucleated neurons with defective lysosomes since there was no nuclear staining in the plaque core when the blue autofluorescence was subtracted. Both Aβ self-oligomers and Aβ/hemoglobin heterocomplexes generated blue autofluorescence. The Aβ amyloid blue autofluorescence not only labels senile plaques but also illustrates red cell aggregation, hemolysis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, vascular plaques, vascular adhesions, and microaneurysms. In summary, we conclude that Aβ-aggregation-generated blue autofluorescence is an excellent multi-amyloidosis marker in Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid aggregation; Aβ; Blue autofluorescence; Cathepsin D; Hemoglobin; Microaneurysm; Senile plaque,,"Fu, H; Li, J; Zhang, C; Du, P; Gao, G; Ge, Q; Guan, X; Cui, D"
Generation of tau dephosphorylation-targeting chimeras for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies.,"Abnormal hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau protein play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other tauopathies. Selective elimination of hyperphosphorylated tau is promising for the therapy of these diseases. We have conceptualized a strategy, named dephosphorylation-targeting chimeras (DEPTACs), for specifically hijacking phosphatases to tau to debilitate its hyperphosphorylation. Here, we conducted the step-by-step optimization of each constituent motif to generate DEPTACs with reasonable effectiveness in facilitating the dephosphorylation and subsequent clearance of pathological tau. Specifically, for one of the selected chimeras, D16, we demonstrated its significant efficiency in rescuing the neurodegeneration caused by neurotoxic K18-tau seeds in vitro. Moreover, intravenous administration of D16 also alleviated tau pathologies in the brain and improved memory deficits in AD mice. These results suggested DEPTACs as targeted modulators of tau phosphorylation, which hold therapeutic potential for AD and other tauopathies.",2024,Dephosphorylation-targeting chimeras; Tauopathy; Therapeutic potential; tau,Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Phosphorylation; Brain,"Su, J; Xiao, Y; Wei, L; Lei, H; Sun, F; Wang, W; Yin, J; Xiong, R; Li, S; Zhang, P; Zhou, Y; Wang, X; Zheng, J; Wang, JZ"

Intra-Atlas Node Size Effects on Graph Metrics in fMRI Data: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Impairment.,"Network neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field merging insights from neuroscience and network theory, offers a profound understanding of neural network intricacies. However, the impact of varying node sizes on computed graph metrics in neuroimaging data remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by adopting a data-driven methodology to delineate functional nodes and assess their influence on graph metrics. Using the Neuromark framework, automated independent component analysis is applied to resting state fMRI data, capturing functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices. Global and local graph metrics reveal intricate connectivity patterns, emphasizing the need for nuanced analysis. Notably, node sizes, computed based on voxel counts, contribute to a novel metric termed 'node-metric coupling' (NMC). Correlations between graph metrics and node dimensions are consistently observed. The study extends its analysis to a dataset comprising Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and control subjects, showcasing the potential of NMC as a biomarker for brain disorders. The two key outcomes underscore the interplay between node sizes and resultant graph metrics within a given atlas, shedding light on an often-overlooked source of variability. Additionally, the study highlights the utility of NMC as a valuable biomarker, emphasizing the necessity of accounting for node sizes in future neuroimaging investigations. This work contributes to refining comparative studies employing diverse atlases and advocates for thoughtful consideration of intra-atlas node size in shaping graph metrics, paving the way for more robust neuroimaging research.",2024,brain networks; fMRI; functional network connectivity; graph metrics; node size,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Mapping; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Brain,"Kolla, S; Falakshahi, H; Abrol, A; Fu, Z; Calhoun, VD"
"Influence of Physiological Variables and Comorbidities on Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 Levels in Cognitively Unimpaired Individuals.","Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a promising tool that may help in early diagnosis. However, their levels may be influenced by physiological parameters and comorbidities that should be considered before they can be used at the population level. For this purpose, we assessed the influences of different comorbidities on AD plasma markers in 208 cognitively unimpaired subjects. We analyzed both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 using the fully automated Lumipulse platform. The relationships between the different plasma markers and physiological variables were studied using linear regression models. The mean differences in plasma markers according to comorbidity groups were also studied. The glomerular filtration rate showed an influence on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The amyloid ratio was significantly lower in diabetic and hypertensive subjects, and the mean p-tau181 levels were higher in hypertensive subjects. The glomerular filtration rate may have an inverse relationship on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the amyloid ratio, suggesting that the latter is a more stable marker to use in the general population. Cardiovascular risk factors might have a long-term effect on the amyloid ratio and plasma levels of p-tau181.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; comorbidities; plasma biomarkers; presymptomatic stages; tau protein,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Comorbidity; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Martínez-Dubarbie, F; Guerra-Ruiz, A; López-García, S; Irure-Ventura, J; Lage, C; Fernández-Matarrubia, M; Pozueta-Cantudo, A; García-Martínez, M; Corrales-Pardo, A; Bravo, M; Martín-Arroyo, J; Infante, J; López-Hoyos, M; García-Unzueta, MT; Sánchez-Juan, P; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, E"
Design of a pragmatic randomized implementation effectiveness trial testing a health system wide hypertension program for older adults.,"Hypertension control remains poor. Multiple barriers at the level of patients, providers, and health systems interfere with implementation of hypertension guidelines and effective lowering of BP. Some strategies such as self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) and remote management by pharmacists are safe and effectively lower BP but have not been effectively implemented. In this study, we combine such evidence-based strategies to build a remote hypertension program and test its effectiveness and implementation in large health systems. This randomized, controlled, pragmatic type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial will examine the virtual collaborative care clinic (vCCC), a hypertension program that integrates automated patient identification, SMBP, remote BP monitoring by trained health system pharmacists, and frequent patient-provider communication. We will randomize 1000 patients with uncontrolled hypertension from two large health systems in a 1:1 ratio to either vCCC or control (usual care with education) groups for a 2-year intervention. Outcome measures including BP measurements, cognitive function, and a symptom checklist will be completed during study visits. Other outcome measures of cardiovascular events, mortality, and health care utilization will be assessed using Medicare data. For the primary outcome of proportion achieving BP control (defined as systolic BP < 130 mmHg) in the two groups, we will use a generalized linear mixed model analysis.

Assessment of immunoprecipitation with subsequent immunoassays for the blood-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"The Aβ42/40 ratio and the concentration of phosphorylated Tau181 in blood plasma represent attractive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. As a means for reducing potential matrix effects, which may interfere with plasma immunoassays, we have previously developed a pre-analytical sample workup by semi-automated immunoprecipitation. Here we test the compatibility of pre-analytical immunoprecipitations with automated Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and phosphorylated Tau181 immunoassays on the Lumipulse platform and compare the diagnostic performance of the respective immunoprecipitation immunoassay approaches with direct plasma measurements. 71 participants were dichotomized according to their Aβ42/40 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid into the diagnostic groups amyloid-positive (n = 32) and amyloid-negative (n = 39). The plasma Aβ1-42/1-40 ratio and phosphorylated Tau181 levels were determined on the Lumipulse G600II platform (Fujirebio) by direct measurements in EDTA-plasma or after Aβ- or Tau-immunoprecipitation, respectively. Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation of Aβ turned out to be compatible with the Lumipulse Aβ assays and resulted in a numerical, yet statistically not significant increase in the area under the ROC curve for plasma Aβ1-42/1-40. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the standardised effect size (Cohen's D). Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation of Tau resulted in increased differences between the diagnostic groups in terms of median and mean phosphorylated Tau 181 levels. Furthermore, we observed a greater Cohen's d (p < 0.001) and a larger area under the ROC curve (p = 0.038) after Tau-IP.

Named Entity Recognition and Normalization for Alzheimer's Disease Eligibility Criteria.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Finding effective treatments for this disease is crucial. Clinical trials play an essential role in developing and testing new treatments for AD. However, identifying eligible participants can be challenging, time-consuming, and costly. In recent years, the development of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically named entity recognition (NER) and named entity normalization (NEN), have helped to automate the identification and extraction of relevant information from the eligibility criteria (EC) more efficiently, in order to facilitate semi-automatic patient recruitment and enable data FAIRness for clinical trial data. Nevertheless, most current biomedical NER models only provide annotations for a restricted set of entity types that may not be applicable to the clinical trial data. Additionally, accurately performing NEN on entities that are negated using a negative prefix currently lacks established techniques. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline designed for information extraction from AD clinical trial EC, which involves preprocessing of the EC data, clinical NER, and biomedical NEN to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our NER model can identify named entities in seven pre-defined categories, while our NEN model employs a combination of exact match and partial match search strategies, as well as customized rules to accurately normalize entities with negative prefixes. To evaluate the performance of our pipeline, we measured the precision, recall, and F1 score for the NER component, and we manually reviewed the top five mapping results produced by the NEN component. Our evaluation of the pipeline's performance revealed that it can successfully normalize named entities in clinical trial ECs with optimal accuracies. The NER component achieved a overall F1 of 0.816, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify seven types of named entities in clinical text. The NEN component of the pipeline also demonstrated impressive performance, with customized rules and a combination of exact and partial match strategies leading to an accuracy of 0.940 for normalized entities.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; clinical trial eligibility criteria; named entity normalization; named entity recognition,,"Sun, Z; Tao, C"

"Comparing the performance of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to predict time-to-event: A simulation study for conversion to mild cognitive impairment.","Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a condition characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities, specifically in memory, language, and attention, that is beyond what is expected due to normal aging. Detection of MCI is crucial for providing appropriate interventions and slowing down the progression of dementia. There are several automated predictive algorithms for prediction using time-to-event data, but it is not clear which is best to predict the time to conversion to MCI. There is also confusion if algorithms with fewer training weights are less accurate. We compared three algorithms, from smaller to large numbers of training weights: a statistical predictive model (Cox proportional hazards model, CoxPH), a machine learning model (Random Survival Forest, RSF), and a deep learning model (DeepSurv). To compare the algorithms under different scenarios, we created a simulated dataset based on the Alzheimer NACC dataset. We found that the CoxPH model was among the best-performing models, in all simulated scenarios. In a larger sample size (n = 6,000), the deep learning algorithm (DeepSurv) exhibited comparable accuracy (73.1%) to the CoxPH model (73%). In the past, ignoring heterogeneity in the CoxPH model led to the conclusion that deep learning methods are superior. We found that when using the CoxPH model with heterogeneity, its accuracy is comparable to that of DeepSurv and RSF. Furthermore, when unobserved heterogeneity is present, such as missing features in the training, all three models showed a similar drop in accuracy. This simulation study suggests that in some applications an algorithm with a smaller number of training weights is not disadvantaged in terms of accuracy. Since algorithms with fewer weights are inherently easier to explain, this study can help artificial intelligence research develop a principled approach to comparing statistical, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms for time-to-event predictions.",2024,,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Algorithms; Cognitive Dysfunction; Machine Learning,"Billichová, M; Coan, LJ; Czanner, S; Kováčová, M; Sharifian, F; Czanner, G"

"A framework for language technologies in behavioral research and clinical applications: Ethical challenges, implications, and solutions.","Technological advances in the assessment and understanding of speech and language within the domains of automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning present a remarkable opportunity for psychologists to learn more about human thought and communication, evaluate a variety of clinical conditions, and predict cognitive and psychological states. These innovations can be leveraged to automate traditionally time-intensive assessment tasks (e.g., educational assessment), provide psychological information and care (e.g., chatbots), and when delivered remotely (e.g., by mobile phone or wearable sensors) promise underserved communities greater access to health care. Indeed, the automatic analysis of speech provides a wealth of information that can be used for patient care in a wide range of settings (e.g., mHealth applications) and for diverse purposes (e.g., behavioral and clinical research, medical tools that are implemented into practice) and patient types (e.g., numerous psychological disorders and in psychiatry and neurology). However, automation of speech analysis is a complex task that requires the integration of several different technologies within a large distributed process with numerous stakeholders. Many organizations have raised awareness about the need for robust systems for ensuring transparency, oversight, and regulation of technologies utilizing artificial intelligence. Since there is limited knowledge about the ethical and legal implications of these applications in psychological science, we provide a balanced view of both the optimism that is widely published on and also the challenges and risks of use, including discrimination and exacerbation of structural inequalities.

Automating the analysis of eye movement for different neurodegenerative disorders.,"The clinical observation and assessment of extra-ocular movements is common practice in assessing neurodegenerative disorders but remains observer-dependent. In the present study, we propose an algorithm that can automatically identify saccades, fixation, smooth pursuit, and blinks using a non-invasive eye tracker. Subsequently, response-to-stimuli-derived interpretable features were elicited that objectively and quantitatively assess patient behaviors. The cohort analysis encompasses persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease mimics (PDM), and controls (CTRL). Overall, results suggested that the AD/MCI and PD groups had significantly different saccade and pursuit characteristics compared to CTRL when the target moved faster or covered a larger visual angle during smooth pursuit. These two groups also displayed more omitted antisaccades and longer average antisaccade latency than CTRL. When reading a text passage silently, people with AD/MCI had more fixations. During visual exploration, people with PD demonstrated a more variable saccade duration than other groups. In the prosaccade task, the PD group showed a significantly smaller average hypometria gain and accuracy, with the most statistical significance and highest AUC scores of features studied. The minimum saccade gain was a PD-specific feature different from CTRL and PDM. These features, as oculographic biomarkers, can be potentially leveraged in distinguishing different types of NDs, yielding more objective and precise protocols to diagnose and monitor disease progression.",2024,Biomarkers; Eye tracking; Interpretability; Neurodegenerative disorders,Humans; Eye Movements; Parkinson Disease; Saccades; Alzheimer Disease; Blinking,"Li, D; Butala, AA; Moro-Velazquez, L; Meyer, T; Oh, ES; Motley, C; Villalba, J; Dehak, N"
De Novo Generation and Identification of Novel Compounds with Drug Efficacy Based on Machine Learning.,"One of the main challenges in small molecule drug discovery is finding novel chemical compounds with desirable activity. Traditional drug development typically begins with target selection, but the correlation between targets and disease remains to be further investigated, and drugs designed based on targets may not always have the desired drug efficacy. The emergence of machine learning provides a powerful tool to overcome the challenge. Herein, a machine learning-based strategy is developed for de novo generation of novel compounds with drug efficacy termed DTLS (Deep Transfer Learning-based Strategy) by using dataset of disease-direct-related activity as input. DTLS is applied in two kinds of disease: colorectal cancer (CRC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In each case, novel compound is discovered and identified in in vitro and in vivo disease models. Their mechanism of actionis further explored. The experimental results reveal that DTLS can not only realize the generation and identification of novel compounds with drug efficacy but also has the advantage of identifying compounds by focusing on protein targets to facilitate the mechanism study. This work highlights the significant impact of machine learning on the design of novel compounds with drug efficacy, which provides a powerful new approach to drug discovery.",2024,de novo design; drug efficacy; lead compound; machine learning,Machine Learning; Drug Discovery; Proteins,"He, D; Liu, Q; Mi, Y; Meng, Q; Xu, L; Hou, C; Wang, J; Li, N; Liu, Y; Chai, H; Yang, Y; Liu, J; Wang, L; Hou, Y"

Sleep-Deep-Net learns sleep wake scoring from the end-user and completes each record in their style.,"Sleep-wake scoring is a time-consuming, tedious but essential component of clinical and pre-clinical sleep research. Sleep scoring is even more laborious and challenging in rodents due to the smaller EEG amplitude differences between states and the rapid state transitions which necessitate scoring in shorter epochs. Although many automated rodent sleep scoring methods exist, they do not perform as well when scoring new data sets, especially those which involve changes in the EEG/EMG profile. Thus, manual scoring by expert scorers remains the gold-standard. Here we take a different approach to this problem by using a neural network to accelerate the scoring of expert scorers. Sleep-Deep-Net (SDN) creates a bespoke deep convolution neural network model for individual electroencephalographic or local-field-potential records via transfer learning of GoogleNet, by learning from a small subset of manual scores of each EEG/LFP record as provided by the end-user. SDN then automates scoring of the remainder of the EEG/LFP record. A novel REM scoring correction procedure further enhanced accuracy. SDN reliably scores EEG and LFP data and retains sleep-wake architecture in wild-type mice, in sleep induced by the hypnotic zolpidem, in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in a genetic knock-down study, when compared to manual scoring. SDN reduced manual scoring time to 1/12. Since SDN uses transfer learning on each independent recording, it is not biased by previously scored existing data sets. Thus, we find SDN performs well when used on signals altered by a drug, disease model or genetic modification.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease Model; Automated Sleep-Wake scoring; Basic Sleep Research; Deep learning; Hypnotics; In Vivo Pharmacology; Transfer learning; Translational Sleep Research,,"Katsuki, F; Spratt, TJ; Brown, RE; Basheer, R; Uygun, DS"
Attention-gated 3D CapsNet for robust hippocampal segmentation.,"The hippocampus is organized in subfields (HSF) involved in learning and memory processes and widely implicated in pathologies at different ages of life, from neonatal hypoxia to temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Getting a highly accurate and robust delineation of sub-millimetric regions such as HSF to investigate anatomo-functional hypotheses is a challenge. One of the main difficulties encountered by those methodologies is related to the small size and anatomical variability of HSF, resulting in the scarcity of manual data labeling. Recently introduced, capsule networks solve analogous problems in medical imaging, providing deep learning architectures with rotational equivariance. Nonetheless, capsule networks are still two-dimensional and unassessed for the segmentation of HSF.",2024,MRI; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; equivariance; hippocampal subfields,,"Poiret, C; Bouyeure, A; Patil, S; Boniteau, C; Duchesnay, E; Grigis, A; Lemaitre, F; Noulhiane, M"

A Microfluidic High-Capacity Screening Platform for Neurological Disorders.,"Compartmentalized cell cultures (CCCs) provide the possibility to study mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, such as spreading of misfolded proteins in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease or functional changes in, e.g., chronic pain, in vitro. However, many CCC devices do not provide the necessary capacity for identifying novel mechanisms, targets, or drugs in a drug discovery context. Here, we present a high-capacity cell culture microtiter microfluidic plate compliant with American National Standard Institute of the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (ANSI/SLAS) standards that allows to parallelize up to 96 CCCs/experimental units, where each experimental unit comprises three microchannel-connected compartments. The plate design allows the specific treatment of cells in individual compartments through the application of a fluidic barrier. Moreover, the compatibility of the plate with neuronal cultures was confirmed with rodent primary as well as human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons of the central or peripheral nervous system for up to 14 days in culture. Using immunocytochemistry, we demonstrated that the plate design restricts neuronal soma to individual compartments, while axons, but not dendrites, can grow through the connecting microchannels to neighboring compartments. In addition, we show that neurons are spontaneously active and, as deemed by the appearance of synchronous depolarizations in neighboring compartments, are synaptically coupled. In summary, the design of the microfluidic plate allows for both morphological and functional studies of neurological in vitro cultures with increased capacity to support identification of novel mechanisms, targets, or drugs.",2024,drug discovery; electrophysiology; in vitro systems; microfluidics; neurological disorders; plate-based screening,Humans; Microfluidics; Axons; Neurons; Cell Culture Techniques; Parkinson Disease,"Moll, L; Pihl, J; Karlsson, M; Karila, P; Svensson, CI"
Glibenclamide-Loaded Engineered Nanovectors (GNVs) Modulate Autophagy and NLRP3-Inflammasome Activation.,"Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to either exogenous (PAMPs) or endogenous (DAMPs) stimuli results in the production of IL-18, caspase-1 and IL-1β. These cytokines have a beneficial role in promoting inflammation, but an excessive activation of the inflammasome and the consequent constitutive inflammatory status plays a role in human pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autophagic removal of NLRP3 inflammasome activators can reduce inflammasome activation and inflammation. Likewise, inflammasome signaling pathways regulate autophagy, allowing the development of inflammatory responses but preventing excessive and detrimental inflammation. Nanotechnology led to the development of liposome engineered nanovectors (NVs) that can load and carry drugs. We verified in an in vitro model of AD-associated inflammation the ability of Glibenclamide-loaded NVs (GNVs) to modulate the balance between inflammasome activation and autophagy. Human THP1dM cells were LPS-primed and oligomeric Aß-stimulated in the presence/absence of GNVs. IL-1β, IL-18 and activated caspase-1 production was evaluated by the Automated Immunoassay System (ELLA); ASC speck formation (a marker of NLRP3 activation) was analyzed by FlowSight Imaging flow-cytometer (AMNIS); the expression of autophagy targets was investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot (WB); and the modulation of autophagy-related up-stream signaling pathways and Tau phosphorylation were WB-quantified. Results showed that GNVs reduce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and prevent the Aß-induced phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, and p70S6 kinases, potentiating autophagic flux and counteracting Tau phosphorylation. These preliminary results support the investigation of GNVs as a possible novel strategy in disease and rehabilitation to reduce inflammasome-associated inflammation.",2023,Glibenclamide-loaded engineered NanoVectors (GNVs); NLRP3; autophagy,,"Saresella, M; Zoia, CP; La Rosa, F; Bazzini, C; Sala, G; Grassenis, E; Marventano, I; Hernis, A; Piancone, F; Conti, E; Sesana, S; Re, F; Seneci, P; Ferrarese, C; Clerici, M"

Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of resting-state fMRI driven machine learning algorithms in the detection of mild cognitive impairment.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a potential therapeutic window in the prevention of dementia; however, automated detection of early cognitive deterioration is an unresolved issue. The aim of our study was to compare various classification approaches to differentiate MCI patients from healthy controls, based on rs-fMRI data, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Own dataset (from two centers) and ADNI database were used during the analysis. Three fMRI parameters were applied in five feature selection algorithms: local correlation, intrinsic connectivity, and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations. Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods were applied for classification. We achieved a relatively wide range of 78-87% accuracy for the various feature selection methods with SVM combining the three rs-fMRI parameters. In the ADNI datasets case we can also see even 90% accuracy scores. RF provided a more harmonized result among the feature selection algorithms in both datasets with 80-84% accuracy for our local and 74-82% for the ADNI database. Despite some lower performance metrics of some algorithms, most of the results were positive and could be seen in two unrelated datasets which increase the validity of our methods.

Accuracy of TrUE-Net in comparison to established white matter hyperintensity segmentation methods: An independent validation study.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are nearly ubiquitous in the aging brain, and their topography and overall burden are associated with cognitive decline. Given their numerosity, accurate methods to automatically segment WMH are needed. Recent developments, including the availability of challenge data sets and improved deep learning algorithms, have led to a new promising deep-learning based automated segmentation model called TrUE-Net, which has yet to undergo rigorous independent validation. Here, we compare TrUE-Net to six established automated WMH segmentation tools, including a semi-manual method. We evaluated the techniques at both global and regional level to compare their ability to detect the established relationship between WMH burden and age. We found that TrUE-Net was highly reliable at identifying WMH regions with low false positive rates, when compared to semi-manual segmentation as the reference standard. TrUE-Net performed similarly or favorably when compared to the other automated techniques. Moreover, TrUE-Net was able to detect relationships between WMH and age to a similar degree as the reference standard semi-manual segmentation at both the global and regional level. These results support the use of TrUE-Net for identifying WMH at the global or regional level, including in large, combined datasets.",2024,Aging; LST; Segmentation Tools; TrUE-Net; WMH,Humans; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Algorithms; Aging; Leukoaraiosis,"Strain, JF; Rahmani, M; Dierker, D; Owen, C; Jafri, H; Vlassenko, AG; Womack, K; Fripp, J; Tosun, D; Benzinger, TLS; Weiner, M; Masters, C; Lee, JM; Morris, JC; Goyal, MS"
An Interpretable Framework for Identifying Cerebral Microbleeds and Alzheimer's Disease Severity using Multimodal Data.,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are tiny chronic brain haemorrhages that have been recognised as prognostic indicators for a number of acute cerebrovascular disorders, such as stroke, traumatic disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. For early-stage chronic disease diagnosis, it is challenging to automate the detection of CMBs and increase the reliability of prediction outputs. This study developed a system for identifying microbleeds in MRI images and gene expression data and determining the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Initially, a spike neural network (SNN) and decision tree were utilised to identify microbleeds in AD from MRI images and gene expression respectively. However, the conclusions of these two methods cannot be interpreted due to the complexity of their internal processing steps. This study proposed two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for interpreting prediction outputs in an effort to boost reliability. Pixel density analysis (PDA) and probabilistic graphical model (PGM) explain the decision-making processes for MRI images and gene expression data for the diagnosis of microbleeds and the severity analysis of AD.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Reproducibility of Results; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Brain,"Kamal, MS; Chowdhury, L; Nimmy, SF; Hasan Rafi, TH; Chae, DK"
The effect of EEG and fNIRS in the digital assessment and digital therapy of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,"In the context of population aging, the growing problem of Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a great challenge to mankind. Although there has been considerable progress in exploring the etiology of AD, i.e., the important role of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the progression of AD has been widely accepted by the scientific community, traditional treatment and monitoring modalities have significant limitations. Therefore novel evaluation and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease are called for emergence. In this research, we sought to review the effectiveness of digital treatment based on monitoring using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). This work searched four electronic databases using a keyword approach and focused on journals focusing on AD and geriatric cognition. Finally, 21 articles were included. The progress of digital therapy and outcome monitoring in AD was reviewed, including digital therapy approaches on different platforms and different neuromonitoring techniques. Because biomarkers such as theta coherence, alpha and beta rhythms, and oxyhemoglobin are effective in monitoring the cognitive level of AD patients, and thus the efficacy of digital therapies, this review particularly focuses on the biomarker validation results of digital therapies. The results show that digital treatment based on biomarker monitoring has good effectiveness. And the effectiveness is reflected in the numerical changes of biomarker indicators monitored by EEG and fNIRS before and after digital treatment. Increases or decreases in the values of these indicators collectively point to improvements in cognitive function (mostly moderate to large effect sizes). The study is the first to examine the state of digital therapy in AD from the perspective of multimodal monitoring, which broadens the research perspective on the effectiveness of AD and gives clinical therapists a ""reference list"" of treatment options. They can select a specific protocol from this ""reference list"" in order to tailor digital therapy to the needs of individual patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; EEG; digital assessment; digital therapy; fNIRS,,"Zhang, Y; Zhang, Y; Jiang, Z; Xu, M; Qing, K"
Correlation transfer function analysis as a biomarker for Alzheimer brain plasticity using longitudinal resting-state fMRI data.,"Neural plasticity is the ability of the brain to alter itself functionally and structurally as a result of its experience. However, longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of the brain are still unrevealed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to discover the significant connections (SCs) between brain regions for AD stages longitudinally using correlation transfer function (CorrTF) as a new biomarker for the disease progression. The dataset consists of: 29 normal controls (NC), and 23, 24, and 23 for early, late mild cognitive impairments (EMCI, LMCI), and ADs, respectively, along three distant visits. The brain was divided into 116 regions using the automated anatomical labeling atlas, where the intensity time series is calculated, and the CorrTF connections are extracted for each region. Finally, the standard t-test and ANOVA test were employed to investigate the SCs for each subject's visit. No SCs, along three visits, were found For NC subjects. The most SCs were mainly directed from cerebellum in case of EMCI and LMCI. Furthermore, the hippocampus connectivity increased in LMCI compared to EMCI whereas missed in AD. Additionally, the patterns of longitudinal changes among the different AD stages compared to Pearson Correlation were similar, for SMC, VC, DMN, and Cereb networks, while differed for EAN and SN networks. Our findings define how brain changes over time, which could help detect functional changes linked to each AD stage and better understand the disease behavior.",2023,,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression,"Mousa, D; Zayed, N; Yassine, IA"

An arrayed CRISPR knockout screen identifies genetic regulators of GLUT1 expression.,"Glucose, a primary fuel source under homeostatic conditions, is transported into cells by membrane transporters such as glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Due to its essential role in maintaining energy homeostasis, dysregulation of GLUT1 expression and function can adversely affect many physiological processes in the body. This has implications in a wide range of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several types of cancers. However, the regulatory pathways that govern GLUT1 expression, which may be altered in these diseases, are poorly characterized. To gain insight into GLUT1 regulation, we performed an arrayed CRISPR knockout screen using Caco-2 cells as a model cell line. Using an automated high content immunostaining approach to quantify GLUT1 expression, we identified more than 300 genes whose removal led to GLUT1 downregulation. Many of these genes were enriched along signaling pathways associated with G-protein coupled receptors, particularly the rhodopsin-like family. Secondary hit validation confirmed that removal of select genes, or modulation of the activity of a corresponding protein, yielded changes in GLUT1 expression. Overall, this work provides a resource and framework for understanding GLUT1 regulation in health and disease.",2023,,Humans; Glucose Transporter Type 1; Caco-2 Cells; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Glucose; Biological Transport,"Shi, Y; Katdare, KA; Kim, H; Rosch, JC; Neal, EH; Vafaie-Partin, S; Bauer, JA; Lippmann, ES"
WarpDrive: Improving spatial normalization using manual refinements.,"Spatial normalization-the process of mapping subject brain images to an average template brain-has evolved over the last 20+ years into a reliable method that facilitates the comparison of brain imaging results across patients, centers & modalities. While overall successful, sometimes, this automatic process yields suboptimal results, especially when dealing with brains with extensive neurodegeneration and atrophy patterns, or when high accuracy in specific regions is needed.

SaLSa: A Combinatory Approach of Semi-Automatic Labeling and Long Short-Term Memory to Classify Behavioral Syllables.,"Accurately and quantitatively describing mouse behavior is an important area. Although advances in machine learning have made it possible to track their behaviors accurately, reliable classification of behavioral sequences or syllables remains a challenge. In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach, called SaLSa (a combination of semi-automatic labeling and long short-term memory-based classification), to classify behavioral syllables of mice exploring an open field. This approach consists of two major steps. First, after tracking multiple body parts, spatial and temporal features of their egocentric coordinates are extracted. A fully automated unsupervised process identifies candidates for behavioral syllables, followed by manual labeling of behavioral syllables using a graphical user interface (GUI). Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier is trained with the labeled data. We found that the classification performance was marked over 97%. It provides a performance equivalent to a state-of-the-art model while classifying some of the syllables. We applied this approach to examine how hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease develops with age. When the proportion of each behavioral syllable was compared between genotypes and sexes, we found that the characteristic hyperlocomotion of female Alzheimer's disease mice emerges between four and eight months. In contrast, age-related reduction in rearing is common regardless of genotype and sex. Overall, SaLSa enables detailed characterization of mouse behavior.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aging; classification; computational ethology; deep learning; long short-term memory,"Mice; Female; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Memory, Short-Term; Memory, Long-Term","Sakata, S"
Where is VALDO? VAscular Lesions Detection and segmentatiOn challenge at MICCAI 2021.,"Imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease provide valuable information on brain health, but their manual assessment is time-consuming and hampered by substantial intra- and interrater variability. Automated rating may benefit biomedical research, as well as clinical assessment, but diagnostic reliability of existing algorithms is unknown. Here, we present the results of the VAscular Lesions DetectiOn and Segmentation (Where is VALDO?) challenge that was run as a satellite event at the international conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Aided Intervention (MICCAI) 2021. This challenge aimed to promote the development of methods for automated detection and segmentation of small and sparse imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease, namely enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) (Task 1), cerebral microbleeds (Task 2) and lacunes of presumed vascular origin (Task 3) while leveraging weak and noisy labels. Overall, 12 teams participated in the challenge proposing solutions for one or more tasks (4 for Task 1-EPVS, 9 for Task 2-Microbleeds and 6 for Task 3-Lacunes). Multi-cohort data was used in both training and evaluation. Results showed a large variability in performance both across teams and across tasks, with promising results notably for Task 1-EPVS and Task 2-Microbleeds and not practically useful results yet for Task 3-Lacunes. It also highlighted the performance inconsistency across cases that may deter use at an individual level, while still proving useful at a population level.",2024,Automated; Brain; CSVD; Challenge; Detection; Enlarged perivascular spaces; Lacunes; MRI; Microbleeds; Segmentation,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Computers,"Sudre, CH; Van Wijnen, K; Dubost, F; Adams, H; Atkinson, D; Barkhof, F; Birhanu, MA; Bron, EE; Camarasa, R; Chaturvedi, N; Chen, Y; Chen, Z; Chen, S; Dou, Q; Evans, T; Ezhov, I; Gao, H; Girones Sanguesa, M; Gispert, JD; Gomez Anson, B; Hughes, AD; Ikram, MA; Ingala, S; Jaeger, HR; Kofler, F; Kuijf, HJ; Kutnar, D; Lee, M; Li, B; Lorenzini, L; Menze, B; Molinuevo, JL; Pan, Y; Puybareau, E; Rehwald, R; Su, R; Shi, P; Smith, L; Tillin, T; Tochon, G; Urien, H; van der Velden, BHM; van der Velpen, IF; Wiestler, B; Wolters, FJ; Yilmaz, P; de Groot, M; Vernooij, MW; de Bruijne, M"
Robustly uncovering the heterogeneity of neurodegenerative disease by using data-driven subtyping in neuroimaging: A review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with heterogeneity in genetics, pathology, and clinical manifestation. Understanding this heterogeneity is particularly relevant for clinical prognosis and stratifying patients for disease modifying treatments. Recently, data-driven methods based on neuroimaging have been applied to investigate the subtyping of neurodegenerative disease, helping to disentangle this heterogeneity. We reviewed brain-based subtyping studies in aging and representative neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia, from January 2000 to November 2022. We summarized clustering methods, validation, robustness, reproducibility, and clinical relevance of 71 eligible studies in the present study. We found vast variations in approaches between studies, including ten neuroimaging modalities, 24 cluster algorithms, and 41 methods of cluster number determination. The clinical relevance of subtyping studies was evaluated by summarizing the analysis method of clinical measurements, showing a relatively low clinical utility in the current studies. Finally, we conclude that future studies of heterogeneity in neurodegenerative disease should focus on validation, comparison between subtyping approaches, and prioritise clinical utility.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Data-driven; Heterogeneity; Neurodegenerative diseases; Subtype,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Reproducibility of Results; Alzheimer Disease; Lewy Body Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuroimaging,"Chen, P; Zhang, S; Zhao, K; Kang, X; Rittman, T; Liu, Y"

Fine-tuning TrailMap: The utility of transfer learning to improve the performance of deep learning in axon segmentation of light-sheet microscopy images.,"Light-sheet microscopy has made possible the 3D imaging of both fixed and live biological tissue, with samples as large as the entire mouse brain. However, segmentation and quantification of that data remains a time-consuming manual undertaking. Machine learning methods promise the possibility of automating this process. This study seeks to advance the performance of prior models through optimizing transfer learning. We fine-tuned the existing TrailMap model using expert-labeled data from noradrenergic axonal structures in the mouse brain. By fine-tuning the final two layers of the neural network at a lower learning rate of the TrailMap model, we demonstrate an improved recall and an occasionally improved adjusted F1-score within our test dataset over using the originally trained TrailMap model.",2023,,,"Oostrom, M; Muniak, MA; Eichler West, RM; Akers, S; Pande, P; Obiri, M; Wang, W; Bowyer, K; Wu, Z; Bramer, LM; Mao, T; Webb-Robertson, BJ"
Reinforcement-Learning-Based Localization of Hippocampus for Alzheimer's Disease Detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily impacting memory and cognitive functions. The hippocampus serves as a key biomarker associated with AD. In this study, we present an end-to-end automated approach for AD detection by introducing a reinforcement-learning-based technique to localize the hippocampus within structural MRI images. Subsequently, this localized hippocampus serves as input for a deep convolutional neural network for AD classification. We model the agent-environment interaction using a Deep Q-Network (DQN), encompassing both a convolutional Target Net and Policy Net. Furthermore, we introduce an integrated loss function that combines cross-entropy and contrastive loss to effectively train the classifier model. Our approach leverages a single optimal slice extracted from each subject's 3D sMRI, thereby reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance comparable to volumetric data analysis methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed localization and classification framework, we compare its performance to the results achieved by supervised models directly trained on ground truth hippocampal regions as input. The proposed approach demonstrates promising performance in terms of classification accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. It achieves an F1-score within an error margin of 3.7% and 1.1% and an accuracy within an error margin of 6.6% and 1.6% when compared to the supervised models trained directly on ground truth masks, all while achieving the highest recall score.",2023,Alzheimer’s detection; deep Q-network; hippocampus region localization; reinforcement learning,,"Raj, A; Mirzaei, G"
A Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation Framework for 3D MRI Classification of Gliomas and Alzheimer's Diseases.,"Accurate and fully automated brain structure examination and prediction from 3D volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a necessary step in medical imaging analysis, which can assist greatly in clinical diagnosis. Traditional deep learning models suffer from severe performance degradation when applied to clinically acquired unlabeled data. The performance degradation is mainly caused by domain discrepancy such as different device types and parameter settings for data acquisition. However, existing approaches focus on the reduction of domain discrepancies but ignore the entanglement of semantic features and domain information. In this article, we explore the feature invariance of categories and domains in different projection spaces and propose a Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation (STDA) method using a joint optimal transport theory and contrastive learning for automatic 3D MRI classification and glioma multi-grade prediction. Specifically, the learning framework updates the distribution of features across domains and categories by Siamese transport network training with an Optimal Cost Transfer Strategy (OCTS) and a Mutual Invariant Constraint (MIC) in two projective spaces to find multiple invariants in potential heterogeneity. We design three sets of transfer task scenarios with different source and target domains, and demonstrate that STDA yields substantially higher generalization performance than other state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. The method is applicable on 3D MRI data from glioma to Alzheimer's disease and has promising applications in the future clinical diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Brain","Yu, L; Liu, J; Wu, Q; Wang, J; Qu, A"

Markov model combined with MR diffusion tensor imaging for predicting the onset of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects cognition, behavior, and memory of brain. It causes 60-80% of dementia cases. Cross-sectional imaging investigations of AD show that magnetic resonance (MR) with diffusion tensor image (DTI)-detected lesion locations in AD patients are heterogeneous and distributed across the imaging area. This study suggested that Markov model (MM) combined with MR-DTI (MM + MR-DTI) was offered as a method for predicting the onset of AD. In 120 subjects (normal controls [NCs], amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI] patients, and AD patients) from a discovery dataset and 122 subjects (NCs, aMCI, and AD) from a replicated dataset, we used them to evaluate the white matter (WM) integrity and abnormalities. We did this by using automated fiber quantification, which allowed us to identify 20 central WM tracts. Point-wise alterations in WM tracts were shown using discovery and replication datasets. The statistical analysis revealed a substantial correlation between microstructural WM alterations and output in the patient groups and cognitive performance, suggesting that this may be a potential biomarker for AD. The MR-based classifier demonstrated the following performance levels for the basis classifiers, with DTI achieving the lowest performance. The following outcomes were seen in MM + MR-DTI using multimodal techniques when combining two modalities. Finally, a combination of every imaging method produced results with an accuracy of 98%, a specificity of 97%, and a sensitivity of 99%. In summary, DTI performs better when paired with structural MR, despite its relatively weak performance when used alone. These findings support the idea that WM modifications play a significant role in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; diffusion tensor imaging; magnetic resonance; white matter,,"Lang, L; Wang, Y"

"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by joining dual attention CNN and MLP based on structural MRIs, clinical and genetic data.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible central nervous degenerative disease, while mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor state of AD. Accurate early diagnosis of AD is conducive to the prevention and early intervention treatment of AD. Although some computational methods have been developed for AD diagnosis, most employ only neuroimaging, ignoring other data (e.g., genetic, clinical) that may have potential disease information. In addition, the results of some methods lack interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel method (called DANMLP) of joining dual attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for computer-aided AD diagnosis by integrating multi-modality data of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical data (i.e., demographics, neuropsychology), and APOE genetic data. Our DANMLP consists of four primary components: (1) the Patch-CNN for extracting the image characteristics from each local patch, (2) the position self-attention block for capturing the dependencies between features within a patch, (3) the channel self-attention block for capturing dependencies of inter-patch features, (4) two MLP networks for extracting the clinical features and outputting the AD classification results, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the 5CV test, DANMLP achieves 93% and 82.4% classification accuracy for the AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC tasks on the ADNI database, which is 0.2%∼15.2% and 3.4%∼26.8% higher than that of other five methods, respectively. The individualized visualization of focal areas can also help clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD. These results indicate that DANMLP can be effectively used for diagnosing AD and MCI patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Attention mechanism; Convolutional neural network; Multi-modality data; Multilayer perceptron,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Neuroimaging; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Cognitive Dysfunction","Qiang, YR; Zhang, SW; Li, JN; Li, Y; Zhou, QY"

Genome-wide association study identifies ,"The PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

Facilitating the structural characterisation of non-canonical amino acids in biomolecular NMR.,"Peptides and proteins containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are a large and important class of biopolymers. They include non-ribosomally synthesised peptides, post-translationally modified proteins, expressed or synthesised proteins containing unnatural amino acids, and peptides and proteins that are chemically modified. Here, we describe a general procedure for generating atomic descriptions required to incorporate ncAAs within popular NMR structure determination software such as CYANA, CNS, Xplor-NIH and ARIA. This procedure is made publicly available via the existing Automated Topology Builder (ATB) server (https://atb.uq.edu.au, last access: 17 February 2023) with all submitted ncAAs stored in a dedicated database. The described procedure also includes a general method for linking of side chains of amino acids from CYANA templates. To ensure compatibility with other systems, atom names comply with IUPAC guidelines. In addition to describing the workflow, 3D models of complex natural products generated by CYANA are presented, including vancomycin. In order to demonstrate the manner in which the templates for ncAAs generated by the ATB can be used in practice, we use a combination of CYANA and CNS to solve the structure of a synthetic peptide designed to disrupt Alzheimer-related protein-protein interactions. Automating the generation of structural templates for ncAAs will extend the utility of NMR spectroscopy to studies of more complex biomolecules, with applications in the rapidly growing fields of synthetic biology and chemical biology. The procedures we outline can also be used to standardise the creation of structural templates for any amino acid and thus have the potential to impact structural biology more generally.",2023,,,"Kuschert, S; Stroet, M; Chin, YK; Conibear, AC; Jia, X; Lee, T; Bartling, CRO; Strømgaard, K; Güntert, P; Rosengren, KJ; Mark, AE; Mobli, M"

Application of Deep Learning for Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease in PET/MR Imaging.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging is a promising technique that combines the advantages of PET and MR to provide both functional and structural information of the brain. Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's neural networks. DL has been applied to various aspects of PET/MR imaging in AD, such as image segmentation, image reconstruction, diagnosis and prediction, and visualization of pathological features. In this review, we introduce the basic concepts and types of DL algorithms, such as feed forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoencoders. We then summarize the current applications and challenges of DL in PET/MR imaging in AD, and discuss the future directions and opportunities for automated diagnosis, predictions of models, and personalized medicine. We conclude that DL has great potential to improve the quality and efficiency of PET/MR imaging in AD, and to provide new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of this devastating disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; magnetic resonance; positron emission tomography,,"Zhao, Y; Guo, Q; Zhang, Y; Zheng, J; Yang, Y; Du, X; Feng, H; Zhang, S"

A novel cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network framework with spatial self-attention mechanism for hippocampus segmentation.,"Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from the brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a crucial task in the neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus structures is challenging due to the small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries of hippocampus. Although some methods have been developed for the hippocampus segmentation, most of them paid too much attention to the hippocampus shape and volume instead of considering the spatial information. Additionally, the extracted features are independent of each other, ignoring the correlation between the global and local information. In view of this, here we proposed a novel cross-layer dual Encoding-Shared Decoding network framework with Spatial self-Attention mechanism (called ESDSA) for hippocampus segmentation in human brains. Considering that the hippocampus is a relatively small part in MRI, we introduced the spatial self-attention mechanism in ESDSA to capture the spatial information of hippocampus for improving the segmentation accuracy. We also designed a cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network to effectively extract the global information of MRIs and the spatial information of hippocampus. The spatial features of hippocampus and the features extracted from the MRIs were combined to realize the hippocampus segmentation. Results on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data show that the performance of our ESDSA is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and the dice similarity coefficient of ESDSA achieves 89.37%. In addition, the dice similarity coefficient of the Spatial Self-Attention mechanism (SSA) strategy and the dual Encoding-Shared Decoding (ESD) strategy is 9.47%, 5.35% higher than that of the baseline U-net, respectively, indicating that the strategies of SSA and ESD can effectively enhance the segmentation accuracy of human brain hippocampus.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Dual encoding-shared decoding network; Hippocampus segmentation; Magnetic resonance images; Spatial self-attention mechanism,"Humans; Hippocampus; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Neuroimaging; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Li, JN; Zhang, SW; Qiang, YR; Zhou, QY"
[Alzheimer's disease classification based on nonlinear high-order features and hypergraph convolutional neural network].,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that damages patients' memory and cognitive abilities. Therefore, the diagnosis of AD holds significant importance. The interactions between regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain often involve multiple areas collaborating in a nonlinear manner. Leveraging these nonlinear higher-order interaction features to their fullest potential contributes to enhancing the accuracy of AD diagnosis. To address this, a framework combining nonlinear higher-order feature extraction and three-dimensional (3D) hypergraph neural networks is proposed for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD. First, a support vector machine regression model based on the radial basis function kernel was trained on ROI data to obtain a base estimator. Then, a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the base estimator was applied to extract nonlinear higher-order features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These features were subsequently constructed into a hypergraph, leveraging the complex interactions captured in the data. Finally, a four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal hypergraph convolutional neural network model was constructed based on the fMRI data for classification. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the Hyper Graph Convolutional Network (HyperGCN) framework by 8% and traditional two-dimensional (2D) linear feature extraction methods by 12% in the AD/normal control (NC) classification task. In conclusion, this framework demonstrates an improvement in AD classification compared to mainstream deep learning methods, providing valuable evidence for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Classification; Functional magnetic resonance imaging data; Hypergraph convolutional neural network; Nonlinear high-order features; Region of interest,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction","Zeng, A; Luo, B; Pan, D; Rong, H; Cao, J; Zhang, X; Lin, J; Yang, Y; Liu, J"

Quantitative analysis of prion disease using an AI-powered digital pathology framework.,"Prion disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of an abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) in the central nervous system. To identify PrPSc aggregates for diagnostic purposes, pathologists use immunohistochemical staining of prion protein antibodies on tissue samples. With digital pathology, artificial intelligence can now analyze stained slides. In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for the identification of PrPSc aggregates in tissue samples from the cerebellar and occipital cortex. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to evaluate PrPSc deposition in digital images. We used two strategies: a deep learning segmentation approach using a vision transformer, and a machine learning classification approach with traditional classifiers. Our method was developed and tested on 64 whole slide images from 41 patients definitively diagnosed with prion disease. The results of our study demonstrated that our proposed framework can accurately classify WSIs from a blind test set. Moreover, it can quantify PrPSc distribution and localization throughout the brain. This could potentially be extended to evaluate protein expression in other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

U-Net based vessel segmentation for murine brains with small micro-magnetic resonance imaging reference datasets.,"Identification and quantitative segmentation of individual blood vessels in mice visualized with preclinical imaging techniques is a tedious, manual or semiautomated task that can require weeks of reviewing hundreds of levels of individual data sets. Preclinical imaging, such as micro-magnetic resonance imaging (μMRI) can produce tomographic datasets of murine vasculature across length scales and organs, which is of outmost importance to study tumor progression, angiogenesis, or vascular risk factors for diseases such as Alzheimer's. Training a neural network capable of accurate segmentation results requires a sufficiently large amount of labelled data, which takes a long time to compile. Recently, several reasonably automated approaches have emerged in the preclinical context but still require significant manual input and are less accurate than the deep learning approach presented in this paper-quantified by the Dice score. In this work, the implementation of a shallow, three-dimensional U-Net architecture for the segmentation of vessels in murine brains is presented, which is (1) open-source, (2) can be achieved with a small dataset (in this work only 8 μMRI imaging stacks of mouse brains were available), and (3) requires only a small subset of labelled training data. The presented model is evaluated together with two post-processing methodologies using a cross-validation, which results in an average Dice score of 61.34% in its best setup. The results show, that the methodology is able to detect blood vessels faster and more reliably compared to state-of-the-art vesselness filters with an average Dice score of 43.88% for the used dataset.",2023,,"Animals; Mice; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain","Praschl, C; Zopf, LM; Kiemeyer, E; Langthallner, I; Ritzberger, D; Slowak, A; Weigl, M; Blüml, V; Nešić, N; Stojmenović, M; Kniewallner, KM; Aigner, L; Winkler, S; Walter, A"

An automated respiratory data pipeline for waveform characteristic analysis.,"Comprehensive and accurate analysis of respiratory and metabolic data is crucial to modelling congenital, pathogenic and degenerative diseases converging on autonomic control failure. A lack of tools for high-throughput analysis of respiratory datasets remains a major challenge. We present Breathe Easy, a novel open-source pipeline for processing raw recordings and associated metadata into operative outcomes, publication-worthy graphs and robust statistical analyses including QQ and residual plots for assumption queries and data transformations. This pipeline uses a facile graphical user interface for uploading data files, setting waveform feature thresholds and defining experimental variables. Breathe Easy was validated against manual selection by experts, which represents the current standard in the field. We demonstrate Breathe Easy's utility by examining a 2-year longitudinal study of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model to assess contributions of forebrain pathology in disordered breathing. Whole body plethysmography has become an important experimental outcome measure for a variety of diseases with primary and secondary respiratory indications. Respiratory dysfunction, while not an initial symptom in many of these disorders, often drives disability or death in patient outcomes. Breathe Easy provides an open-source respiratory analysis tool for all respiratory datasets and represents a necessary improvement upon current analytical methods in the field. KEY POINTS: Respiratory dysfunction is a common endpoint for disability and mortality in many disorders throughout life. Whole body plethysmography in rodents represents a high face-value method for measuring respiratory outcomes in rodent models of these diseases and disorders. Analysis of key respiratory variables remains hindered by manual annotation and analysis that leads to low throughput results that often exclude a majority of the recorded data. Here we present a software suite, Breathe Easy, that automates the process of data selection from raw recordings derived from plethysmography experiments and the analysis of these data into operative outcomes and publication-worthy graphs with statistics. We validate Breathe Easy with a terabyte-scale Alzheimer's dataset that examines the effects of forebrain pathology on respiratory function over 2 years of degeneration.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; breath analysis; mixed effects modelling; respiratory analysis; waveform feature extraction; whole body plethysmography,Animals; Mice; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Software; Respiration; Plethysmography,"Lusk, S; Ward, CS; Chang, A; Twitchell-Heyne, A; Fattig, S; Allen, G; Jankowsky, JL; Ray, RS"

Functional connectome through the human life span.,"The lifespan growth of the functional connectome remains unknown. Here, we assemble task-free functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 33,250 individuals aged 32 postmenstrual weeks to 80 years from 132 global sites. We report critical inflection points in the nonlinear growth curves of the global mean and variance of the connectome, peaking in the late fourth and late third decades of life, respectively. After constructing a fine-grained, lifespan-wide suite of system-level brain atlases, we show distinct maturation timelines for functional segregation within different systems. Lifespan growth of regional connectivity is organized along a primary-to-association cortical axis. These connectome-based normative models reveal substantial individual heterogeneities in functional brain networks in patients with autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.

Predicting brain age gap with radiomics and automl: A Promising approach for age-Related brain degeneration biomarkers.,"The Brain Age Gap (BAG), which refers to the difference between chronological age and predicted neuroimaging age, is proposed as a potential biomarker for age-related brain degeneration.

This study focuses on the application of radiomics, an advanced imaging analysis technique, combined with automated machine learning to predict BAG. Our methods achieve a promising result with a mean absolute error of 1.509 using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Furthermore, we find that the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus play a significant role in predicting age with interpretable method called SHapley Additive exPlanations. Additionally, our investigation of age prediction discrepancies between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) reveals a notable correlation with clinical cognitive assessment scale scores.

Text-message DPP can potentially overcome barriers and improve DPP outcomes for this group. We aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminarily effectiveness of a culturally and linguistically adapted text-message DPP for Latinos. We enrolled 26 eligible Spanish-speaking Latino adults at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (A1c = 5.7%-6.4%, body mass index ≥25) in a 6-month culturally and linguistically adapted text-message DPP. Participants received (i) two to three daily automated text-messages about healthy eating, physical activity, problem-solving skills, lifestyle change motivation, and logistics, (ii) on-demand keyword-driven messages, and (iii) on-demand chat messages with a DPP coach. Outcomes included feasibility (e.g. adherence), acceptability (e.g. satisfaction), and preliminary effectiveness (e.g. weight loss). Twenty-four participants completed the program and follow-up assessments.

Classification of Alzheimer's disease stages from magnetic resonance images using deep learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive type of dementia characterized by loss of memory and other cognitive abilities, including speech. Since AD is a progressive disease, detection in the early stages is essential for the appropriate care of the patient throughout its development, going from asymptomatic to a stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then progressing to dementia and severe dementia; is worth mentioning that everyone suffers from cognitive impairment to some degree as we age, but the relevant task here is to identify which people are most likely to develop AD. Along with cognitive tests, evaluation of the brain morphology is the primary tool for AD diagnosis, where atrophy and loss of volume of the frontotemporal lobe are common features in patients who suffer from the disease. Regarding medical imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are one of the methods used by specialists to assess brain morphology. Recently, with the rise of deep learning (DL) and its successful implementation in medical imaging applications, it is of growing interest in the research community to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems that can help physicians to detect this disease, especially in the early stages where macroscopic changes are not so easily identified. This article presents a DL-based approach to classifying MRI scans in the different stages of AD, using a curated set of images from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies databases. Our methodology involves image pre-processing using FreeSurfer, spatial data-augmentation operations, such as rotation, flip, and random zoom during training, and state-of-the-art 3D convolutional neural networks such as EfficientNet, DenseNet, and a custom siamese network, as well as the relatively new approach of vision transformer architecture. With this approach, the best detection percentage among all four architectures was around 89% for AD ",2023,Computer-aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Digital image processing; Supervised learning,,"Mora-Rubio, A; Bravo-Ortíz, MA; Quiñones Arredondo, S; Saborit Torres, JM; Ruz, GA; Tabares-Soto, R"
DE-JANet: A unified network based on dual encoder and joint attention for Alzheimer's disease classification using multi-modal data.,"Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), which can reflect cerebral atrophy, plays an important role in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the information provided by analyzing only the morphological changes in sMRI is relatively limited, and the assessment of the atrophy degree is subjective. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine sMRI with other clinical information to acquire complementary diagnosis information and achieve a more accurate classification of AD. Nevertheless, how to fuse these multi-modal data effectively is still challenging. In this paper, we propose DE-JANet, a unified AD classification network that integrates image data sMRI with non-image clinical data, such as age and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, for more effective multi-modal analysis. DE-JANet consists of three key components: (1) a dual encoder module for extracting low-level features from the image and non-image data according to specific encoding regularity, (2) a joint attention module for fusing multi-modal features, and (3) a token classification module for performing AD-related classification according to the fused multi-modal features. Our DE-JANet is evaluated on the ADNI dataset, with a mean accuracy of 0.9722 and 0.9538 for AD classification and mild cognition impairment (MCI) classification, respectively, which is superior to existing methods and indicates advanced performance on AD-related diagnosis tasks.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Convolutional neural network; Joint attention; Multi-modal data,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Dai, Y; Zou, B; Zhu, C; Li, Y; Chen, Z; Ji, Z; Kui, X; Zhang, W"
Effects of de-facing software mri_reface on utility of imaging biomarkers used in Alzheimer's disease research.,"Brain imaging research studies increasingly use ""de-facing"" software to remove or replace facial imagery before public data sharing. Several works have studied the effects of de-facing software on brain imaging biomarkers by directly comparing automated measurements from unmodified vs de-faced images, but most research brain images are used in analyses of correlations with cognitive measurements or clinical statuses, and the effects of de-facing on these types of imaging-to-cognition correlations has not been measured. In this work, we focused on brain imaging measures of amyloid (A), tau (T), neurodegeneration (N), and vascular (V) measures used in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research. We created a retrospective sample of participants from three age- and sex-matched clinical groups (cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia, and we performed region- and voxel-wise analyses of: hippocampal volume (N), white matter hyperintensity volume (V), amyloid PET (A), and tau PET (T) measures, each from multiple software pipelines, on their ability to separate cognitively defined groups and their degrees of correlation with age and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). We performed each of these analyses twice: once with unmodified images and once with images de-faced with leading de-facing software mri_reface, and we directly compared the findings and their statistical strengths between the original vs. the de-faced images. Analyses with original and with de-faced images had very high agreement. There were no significant differences between any voxel-wise comparisons. Among region-wise comparisons, only three out of 55 correlations were significantly different between original and de-faced images, and these were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Overall, the statistical power of the imaging data for AD biomarkers was almost identical between unmodified and de-faced images, and their analyses results were extremely consistent.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Anonymization; De-facing; De-identification; Face recognition,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Retrospective Studies; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; tau Proteins,"Schwarz, CG; Kremers, WK; Weigand, SD; Prakaashana, CM; Senjem, ML; Przybelski, SA; Lowe, VJ; Gunter, JL; Kantarci, K; Vemuri, P; Graff-Radford, J; Petersen, RC; Knopman, DS; Jack, CR"

An intervention usability and acceptability tool was completed by telephone with family caregivers 3 months after delivery of the pet to the home. Overall, 80% of Veterans used the pet often or daily, while 7 caregivers provided reminders for the Veteran to use the pet.

Automatic Segmentation of Retinal Layers in Multiple Neurodegenerative Disorder Scenarios.,"Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) allows the non-invasive direct observation of the central nervous system, enabling the measurement and extraction of biomarkers from neural tissue that can be helpful in the assessment of ocular, systemic and Neurological Disorders (ND). Deep learning models can be trained to segment the retinal layers for biomarker extraction. However, the onset of ND can have an impact on the neural tissue, which can lead to the degraded performance of models not exposed to images displaying signs of disease during training. We present a fully automatic approach for the retinal layer segmentation in multiple neurodegenerative disorder scenarios, using an annotated dataset of patients of the most prevalent NDs: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and essential tremor, along with healthy control patients. Furthermore, we present a two-part, comprehensive study on the effects of ND on the performance of these models. The results show that images of healthy patients may not be sufficient for the robust training of automated segmentation models intended for the analysis of ND patients, and that using images representative of different NDs can increase the model performance. These results indicate that the presence or absence of patients of ND in datasets should be taken into account when training deep learning models for retinal layer segmentation, and that the proposed approach can provide a valuable tool for the robust and reliable diagnosis in multiple scenarios of ND.",2023,,"Humans; Retina; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Multiple Sclerosis; Parkinson Disease","Gende, M; Mallen, V; de Moura, J; Cordon, B; Garcia-Martin, E; Sanchez, CI; Novo, J; Ortega, M"
Clinically-Inspired Multi-Agent Transformers for Disease Trajectory Forecasting From Multimodal Data.,"Deep neural networks are often applied to medical images to automate the problem of medical diagnosis. However, a more clinically relevant question that practitioners usually face is how to predict the future trajectory of a disease. Current methods for prognosis or disease trajectory forecasting often require domain knowledge and are complicated to apply. In this paper, we formulate the prognosis prediction problem as a one-to-many prediction problem. Inspired by a clinical decision-making process with two agents-a radiologist and a general practitioner - we predict prognosis with two transformer-based components that share information with each other. The first transformer in this framework aims to analyze the imaging data, and the second one leverages its internal states as inputs, also fusing them with auxiliary clinical data. The temporal nature of the problem is modeled within the transformer states, allowing us to treat the forecasting problem as a multi-task classification, for which we propose a novel loss. We show the effectiveness of our approach in predicting the development of structural knee osteoarthritis changes and forecasting Alzheimer's disease clinical status directly from raw multi-modal data. The proposed method outperforms multiple state-of-the-art baselines with respect to performance and calibration, both of which are needed for real-world applications.

Towards precise PICO extraction from abstracts of randomized controlled trials using a section-specific learning approach.,"Automated extraction of participants, intervention, comparison/control, and outcome (PICO) from the randomized controlled trial (RCT) abstracts is important for evidence synthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of applying natural language processing (NLP) for PICO extraction. However, the performance is not optimal due to the complexity of PICO information in RCT abstracts and the challenges involved in their annotation.",2023,,,"Hu, Y; Keloth, VK; Raja, K; Chen, Y; Xu, H"
Unsupervised contrastive graph learning for resting-state functional MRI analysis and brain disorder detection.,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) helps characterize regional interactions that occur in the human brain at a resting state. Existing research often attempts to explore fMRI biomarkers that best predict brain disease progression using machine/deep learning techniques. Previous fMRI studies have shown that learning-based methods usually require a large amount of labeled training data, limiting their utility in clinical practice where annotating data is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To this end, we propose an unsupervised contrastive graph learning (UCGL) framework for fMRI-based brain disease analysis, in which a pretext model is designed to generate informative fMRI representations using unlabeled training data, followed by model fine-tuning to perform downstream disease identification tasks. Specifically, in the pretext model, we first design a bi-level fMRI augmentation strategy to increase the sample size by augmenting blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, and then employ two parallel graph convolutional networks for fMRI feature extraction in an unsupervised contrastive learning manner. This pretext model can be optimized on large-scale fMRI datasets, without requiring labeled training data. This model is further fine-tuned on to-be-analyzed fMRI data for downstream disease detection in a task-oriented learning manner. We evaluate the proposed method on three rs-fMRI datasets for cross-site and cross-dataset learning tasks. Experimental results suggest that the UCGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in automated diagnosis of three brain diseases (i.e., major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease) with rs-fMRI data.",2023,brain disorder; data augmentation; fine-tuning; functional MRI; small-sample-size,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Rest; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease","Wang, X; Chu, Y; Wang, Q; Cao, L; Qiao, L; Zhang, L; Liu, M"

Combining aperiodic 1/f slopes and brain simulation: An EEG/MEG proxy marker of excitation/inhibition imbalance in Alzheimer's disease.,"Accumulation and interaction of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins during progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are shown to tilt neuronal circuits away from balanced excitation/inhibition (E/I). Current available techniques for noninvasive interrogation of E/I in the intact human brain, for example, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), are highly restrictive (i.e., limited spatial extent), have low temporal and spatial resolution and suffer from the limited ability to distinguish accurately between different neurotransmitters complicating its interpretation. As such, these methods alone offer an incomplete explanation of E/I. Recently, the aperiodic component of neural power spectrum, often referred to in the literature as the '1/f slope', has been described as a promising and scalable biomarker that can track disruptions in E/I potentially underlying a spectrum of clinical conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, or epilepsy, as well as developmental E/I changes as seen in aging.",2023,1/f slope; Alzheimer's disease; EEG; MEG; excitation‐inhibition; network of spiking neurons,,"Martínez-Cañada, P; Perez-Valero, E; Minguillon, J; Pelayo, F; López-Gordo, MA; Morillas, C"

Automating Rey Complex Figure Test scoring using a deep learning-based approach: a potential large-scale screening tool for cognitive decline.,"The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) has been widely used to evaluate the neurocognitive functions in various clinical groups with a broad range of ages. However, despite its usefulness, the scoring method is as complex as the figure. Such a complicated scoring system can lead to the risk of reducing the extent of agreement among raters. Although several attempts have been made to use RCFT in clinical settings in a digitalized format, little attention has been given to develop direct automatic scoring that is comparable to experienced psychologists. Therefore, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) scoring system for RCFT using a deep learning (DL) algorithm and confirmed its validity.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Rey Complex Figure Test; Scoring,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Cognitive Dysfunction; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease,"Park, JY; Seo, EH; Yoon, HJ; Won, S; Lee, KH"

Validating ASHS-T1 automated entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical segmentation in Alzheimer's disease.,"The current study aimed to validate entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes measured by the automated segmentation tool Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS-T1). The study sample comprised 34 healthy controls (HCs), 37 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 29 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes were assessed using ASHS-T1, manual segmentation, as well as a widely used automated segmentation tool, FreeSurfer v6.0.1. Mean differences, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Bland-Altman plots were computed. ASHS-T1 tended to underestimate entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volumes relative to manual segmentation and FreeSurfer. There was variable consistency and low agreement between ASHS-T1 and manual segmentation volumes. There was low-to-moderate consistency and low agreement between ASHS-T1 and FreeSurfer volumes. There was a trend toward higher consistency and agreement for the entorhinal cortex in the aMCI and AD groups compared to the HC group. Despite the differences in volume measurements, ASHS-T1 was sensitive to entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical atrophy in both early and late disease stages. Based on the current study, ASHS-T1 appears to be a promising tool for automated entorhinal and transentorhinal cortical volume measurement in individuals with likely underlying AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Automated segmentation; Entorhinal cortex; Magnetic resonance imaging; Manual segmentation; Transentorhinal cortex,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Entorhinal Cortex","Quek, YE; Bourgeat, P; Fung, YL; Vogrin, SJ; Collins, SJ; Bowden, SC"
Segmenting white matter hyperintensities on isotropic three-dimensional Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery magnetic resonance images: Assessing deep learning tools on a Norwegian imaging database.,"An important step in the analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for neuroimaging is the automated segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR-weighted) is an MRI contrast that is particularly useful to visualize and quantify WMHs, a hallmark of cerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to achieve high spatial resolution in each of the three voxel dimensions, clinical MRI protocols are evolving to a three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR-weighted acquisition. The current study details the deployment of deep learning tools to enable automated WMH segmentation and characterization from 3D FLAIR-weighted images acquired as part of a national AD imaging initiative. Based on data from the ongoing Norwegian Disease Dementia Initiation (DDI) multicenter study, two 3D models-one off-the-shelf from the NVIDIA nnU-Net framework and the other internally developed-were trained, validated, and tested. A third cutting-edge Deep Bayesian network model (HyperMapp3r) was implemented without any de-novo tuning to serve as a comparison architecture. The 2.5D in-house developed and 3D nnU-Net models were trained and validated in-house across five national collection sites among 441 participants from the DDI study, of whom 194 were men and whose average age was (64.91 +/- 9.32) years. Both an external dataset with 29 cases from a global collaborator and a held-out subset of the internal data from the 441 participants were used to test all three models. These test sets were evaluated independently. The ground truth human-in-the-loop segmentation was compared against five established WMH performance metrics. The 3D nnU-Net had the highest performance out of the three tested networks, outperforming both the internally developed 2.5D model and the SOTA Deep Bayesian network with an average dice similarity coefficient score of 0.76 +/- 0.16. Our findings demonstrate that WMH segmentation models can achieve high performance when trained exclusively on FLAIR input volumes that are 3D volumetric acquisitions. Single image input models are desirable for ease of deployment, as reflected in the current embedded clinical research project. The 3D nnU-Net had the highest performance, which suggests a way forward for our need to automate WMH segmentation while also evaluating performance metrics during on-going data collection and model retraining.",2023,,Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Female; Bayes Theorem; Deep Learning; White Matter; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Leukoaraiosis; Alzheimer Disease,"Røvang, MS; Selnes, P; MacIntosh, BJ; Rasmus Groote, I; Pålhaugen, L; Sudre, C; Fladby, T; Bjørnerud, A"

"Qualitative Bioinformatics: Towards a Public Understanding of Neurodegenerative Disease Research through BioArt, Data-Art, Hands-on BioMedia Workshops, Immersive Environments, and Artists in Labs.","Neurodegenerative disease (ND) research is producing new pharmaceutical compounds for chronic diseases utilizing bioinformatics. Algorithmic data mining of high-throughput omics systems is conjoined with the study of the in vitro dynamics of protein folding through visualization techniques, i.e., Bio-AFM. Novel models of disease pathway diagrams are being produced and the processes are in place to enhance the validation of these models. From bench work to BLAST to bedside, globally standardized research is led by collaborative clusters, working on cloud-based platforms, with crowd sourced human cohort collections, pairing pure, curiosity-based neurological research with deep learning data analysis techniques. ND research is leading the way towards clinical applications for preventing, curing, or ameliorating major diseases of neurological dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).Most of this is too complex for the average citizen to comprehend. Can bioart and data-art contribute to the public understanding of genome sequencing and bioinformatics databases in the context of ND research? Informal studies towards demystifying bioinformatics through creative practices have been tested, revealing significant qualitative benefits for public well-being while introducing bioinformatics databases, for instance, previous projects: the VASTAL Bioinformatics and Literary Studies: (De)Mystified Genetic Code Lab, held at the Waag in Amsterdam, NL, 2009 and more recently the Creative Germline Constructs Bank (CGCB) of the transgenic human Genome Alternatives Project (thGAP), held at Hackteria ZET, Zurich, Switzerland, 2021.For the Hub of Art Laboratories (HAL), of the Department of Audio & Visual Arts (AVArts), Ionian University in Corfu, Greece, the animation node is challenged to create audiovisual, immersive, and interactive environments that highlight natural processes and phenomena of the microcosm and macrocosm through nature/data interface experimentation. It is the intention of the node's researchers to expand these notions to be inclusive of the processes of the biotechnological and bioinformatics interrogation of human disease as a part of local clades and global nature. In our productions, we would like to emphasize: cryogenic storage, genome analysis, bioinformatic database management, biomarkers for polygenic abnormalities, genotyping/phenotyping, gene expression patterns over time, AI reading of cloud-based research, experiencial DNA/RNA synthesis, the development of novel DNA, RNA and protein-based therapeutic agents for biomedical applications and CRISPR construct design for model organisms. It is the HAL animation node's goal to design and explore bioart-based, hands-on public workshops that mix bioinformatics and data-art with in-depth knowledge of the scientific community around ND research bodies.To develop these labs, dedicated artistic research is required to be undertaken through laboratory immersion, interactions with scientists, and hands-on experience in the lab. Artists must experience scientific processes through residencies in labs to learn both how to convey the techniques and the social implications of novel methodologies. Artists developing bioart workshops that can introduce non-specialists to a dizzying array of research methodologies need to know what they are talking about. It takes experience and dedication to convey simplified versions of real-time biosensor data, automated histology, clinical databases of medical case studies (anonymized clients), real-time PCR, novel diagnostic biomarker development, etc. As qualitative researchers, artists in labs ensure creative yet informed art and science (SciArt) outcomes able to stimulate public debate through unorthodox education and accurate playfulness.

The Objective Dementia Severity Scale Based on MRI with Contrastive Learning: A Whole Brain Neuroimaging Perspective.,"In the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, one of the most important tasks is evaluating its severity for diagnosis and therapy. However, traditional testing methods are deficient, such as their susceptibility to subjective factors, incomplete evaluation, low accuracy, or insufficient granularity, resulting in unreliable evaluation scores. To address these issues, we propose an objective dementia severity scale based on MRI (ODSS-MRI) using contrastive learning to automatically evaluate the neurological function of patients. The approach utilizes a deep learning framework and a contrastive learning strategy to mine relevant information from structural magnetic resonance images to obtain the patient's neurological function level score. Given that the model is driven by the patient's whole brain imaging data, but without any possible biased manual intervention or instruction from the physician or patient, it provides a comprehensive and objective evaluation of the patient's neurological function. We conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and the results showed that the proposed ODSS-MRI was correlated with the stages of AD 88.55% better than all existing methods. This demonstrates its efficacy to describe the neurological function changes of patients during AD progression. It also outperformed traditional psychiatric rating scales in discriminating different stages of AD, which is indicative of its superiority for neurological function evaluation.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; contrastive learning; disease evaluation; medical robots,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain,"Zhang, Y; Fan, W; Chen, X; Li, W"

Sexual coordination in a whole-brain map of prairie vole pair bonding.,"Sexual bonds are central to the social lives of many species, including humans, and monogamous prairie voles have become the predominant model for investigating such attachments. We developed an automated whole-brain mapping pipeline to identify brain circuits underlying pair-bonding behavior. We identified bonding-related c-Fos induction in 68 brain regions clustered in seven major brain-wide neuronal circuits. These circuits include known regulators of bonding, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular hypothalamus, ventral pallidum, and prefrontal cortex. They also include brain regions previously unknown to shape bonding, such as ventromedial hypothalamus, medial preoptic area and the medial amygdala, but that play essential roles in bonding-relevant processes, such as sexual behavior, social reward and territorial aggression. Contrary to some hypotheses, we found that circuits active during mating and bonding were largely sexually monomorphic. Moreover, c-Fos induction across regions was strikingly consistent between members of a pair, with activity best predicted by rates of ejaculation. A novel cluster of regions centered in the amygdala remained coordinated after bonds had formed, suggesting novel substrates for bond maintenance. Our tools and results provide an unprecedented resource for elucidating the networks that translate sexual experience into an enduring bond.",2023,,,"Gustison, ML; Muñoz-Castañeda, R; Osten, P; Phelps, SM"

PFP-HOG: Pyramid and Fixed-Size Patch-Based HOG Technique for Automated Brain Abnormality Classification with MRI.,"Detecting neurological abnormalities such as brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images is an important research topic in the literature. Numerous machine learning models have been used to detect brain abnormalities accurately. This study addresses the problem of detecting neurological abnormalities in MRI. The motivation behind this problem lies in the need for accurate and efficient methods to assist neurologists in the diagnosis of these disorders. In addition, many deep learning techniques have been applied to MRI to develop accurate brain abnormality detection models, but these networks have high time complexity. Hence, a novel hand-modeled feature-based learning network is presented to reduce the time complexity and obtain high classification performance. The model proposed in this work uses a new feature generation architecture named pyramid and fixed-size patch (PFP). The main aim of the proposed PFP structure is to attain high classification performance using essential feature extractors with both multilevel and local features. Furthermore, the PFP feature extractor generates low- and high-level features using a handcrafted extractor. To obtain the high discriminative feature extraction ability of the PFP, we have used histogram-oriented gradients (HOG); hence, it is named PFP-HOG. Furthermore, the iterative Chi2 (IChi2) is utilized to choose the clinically significant features. Finally, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) with tenfold cross-validation is used for automated classification. Four MRI neurological databases (AD dataset, brain tumor dataset 1, brain tumor dataset 2, and merged dataset) have been utilized to develop our model. PFP-HOG and IChi2-based models attained 100%, 94.98%, 98.19%, and 97.80% using the AD dataset, brain tumor dataset1, brain tumor dataset 2, and merged brain MRI dataset, respectively. These findings not only provide an accurate and robust classification of various neurological disorders using MRI but also hold the potential to assist neurologists in validating manual MRI brain abnormality screening.",2023,Biomedical image processing; Brain MRI; Computer vision; HOG; Pyramid and fixed-size patch feature extraction,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Alzheimer Disease,"Kaplan, E; Chan, WY; Altinsoy, HB; Baygin, M; Barua, PD; Chakraborty, S; Dogan, S; Tuncer, T; Acharya, UR"
A fully automated home cage for long-term continuous phenotyping of mouse cognition and behavior.,"Automated home-cage monitoring systems present a valuable tool for comprehensive phenotyping of natural behaviors. However, current systems often involve complex training routines, water or food restriction, and probe a limited range of behaviors. Here, we present a fully automated home-cage monitoring system for cognitive and behavioral phenotyping in mice. The system incorporates T-maze alternation, novel object recognition, and object-in-place recognition tests combined with monitoring of locomotion, drinking, and quiescence patterns, all carried out over long periods. Mice learn the tasks rapidly without any need for water or food restrictions. Behavioral characterization employs a deep convolutional neural network image analysis. We show that combined statistical properties of multiple behaviors can be used to discriminate between mice with hippocampal, medial entorhinal, and sham lesions and predict the genotype of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model with high accuracy. This technology may enable large-scale behavioral screening for genes and neural circuits underlying spatial memory and other cognitive processes.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; automated classification; home-cage system; longitudinal monitoring; machine learning; mouse behavioural cognitive testing,"Mice; Animals; Cognition; Hippocampus; Alzheimer Disease; Computers; Behavior, Animal","Ho, H; Kejzar, N; Sasaguri, H; Saito, T; Saido, TC; De Strooper, B; Bauza, M; Krupic, J"

A new automatic method for tracking rats in the Morris water maze.,"Morris water maze (MWM) test is widely used to evaluate the learning and memory deficits in rodents. Image processing and pattern recognition can be used to analyse videos and recognize automatically the tracking in MWM. There are several commercial and free access software that allows analyzing the behavioral tasks although they also have limitations such as automation, cost, user intervention among other things. The aim of this paper was to develop a new image processing technique to automatically analyse the track of the rat in the MWM, which we called RatsTrack. The MWM test was performed with an animal model for Alzheimer, and the videos were recorded to measure the distance, time, and speed. The segmentation method based on the projection of the video frames was made for pool identification, eliminating the rat, while conserving the shape of the pool. Then, the Hough transformation was used to recognize the position and radius of the pool. Finally, the frame in which the rat is released into the pool was established automatically using mathematical morphology techniques and added as a plugin on free access ImageJ software. The new image processing technique, RatsTrack, successfully detected and located the pool and rat without user intervention, significantly decreasing operational time and providing results for distance, time, speed, and acceleration parameters of the MWM test. Alzheimer's rats compared with the control group presented significant data measured with the RatsTrack. RatsTrack is a plugin of ImageJ software and will be made freely available for public use.",2023,Image processing; ImageJ; Memory; Morris water maze; Pattern recognition; Tracking,,"Forero, MG; Hernández, NC; Morera, CM; Aguilar, LA; Aquino, R; Baquedano, LE"
Genome-Wide Epistasis Study of Cerebrospinal Fluid Hyperphosphorylated Tau in ADNI Cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide, and the genetic mechanism of which is not yet fully understood. Much evidence has accumulated over the past decade to suggest that after the first large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted, the problem of ""missing heritability"" in AD is still a great challenge. Epistasis has been considered as one of the main causes of ""missing heritability"" in AD, which has been largely ignored in human genetics. The focus of current genome-wide epistasis studies is usually on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have significant individual effects, and the amount of heritability explained by which was very low. Moreover, AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal damage, and some studies have suggested that hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) mediates neuronal death by inducing necroptosis and inflammation in AD. Therefore, this study focused on identifying epistasis between two-marker interactions at marginal main effects across the whole genome using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) P-tau as quantitative trait (QT). We sought to detect interactions between SNPs in a multi-GPU based linear regression method by using age, gender, and clinical diagnostic status (cds) as covariates. We then used the STRING online tool to perform the PPI network and identify two-marker epistasis at the level of gene-gene interaction. A total of 758 SNP pairs were found to be statistically significant. Particularly, between the marginal main effect SNP pairs, highly significant SNP-SNP interactions were identified, which explained a relatively high variance at the P-tau level. In addition, 331 AD-related genes were identified, 10 gene-gene interaction pairs were replicated in the PPI network. The identified gene-gene interactions and genes showed associations with AD in terms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, neuronal cells activation and brain development, thereby leading to cognitive decline in AD, which is indirectly associated with the P-tau pathological feature of AD and in turn supports the results of this study. Thus, the results of our study might be beneficial for explaining part of the ""missing heritability"" of AD.",2023,ADNI; Alzheimer’s disease; PPI; epistasis; hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau),"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Genome-Wide Association Study; Epistasis, Genetic","Chen, D; Li, J; Liu, H; Liu, X; Zhang, C; Luo, H; Wei, Y; Xi, Y; Liang, H; Zhang, Q"

Traditional screening methods such as brain scans or psychiatric tests are stressful and costly. The patients are likely to feel reluctant to such screenings and fail to receive timely intervention. While researchers have been exploring the use of language in dementia detection, less attention has been given to face-related features. The paper focuses on investigating how face-related features can aid in detecting dementia by exploring the PROMPT dataset that contains video data collected from patients with dementia during interviews. In this work, we extracted three types of features from the videos, including face mesh, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, and Action Units (AU). We trained traditional machine learning models and deep learning models on the extracted features and investigated their effectiveness in dementia detection. Our experiments show that the use of HOG features achieved the highest accuracy of 79% in dementia detection, followed by AU features with 71% accuracy, and face mesh features with 66% accuracy. Our results show that face-related features have the potential to be a crucial indicator in automated computational dementia detection.",2023,HOG; action unit; dementia detection; face mesh; machine learning,,"Zheng, C; Bouazizi, M; Ohtsuki, T; Kitazawa, M; Horigome, T; Kishimoto, T"
Spatial cognition is associated with levels of phosphorylated-tau and β-amyloid in clinically normal older adults.,Spatial cognition is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the symptomatic stages of the disease. We investigated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (phosphorylated-tau [p-tau] and β-amyloid) are associated with poorer spatial cognition in clinically normal older adults. Participants were 1875 clinically normal adults (age 67.8 [8.5] years) from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia Consortium.

FIESTA: Autoencoders for accurate fiber segmentation in tractography.,"White matter bundle segmentation is a cornerstone of modern tractography to study the brain's structural connectivity in domains such as neurological disorders, neurosurgery, and aging. In this study, we present FIESTA (FIbEr Segmentation in Tractography using Autoencoders), a reliable and robust, fully automated, and easily semi-automatically calibrated pipeline based on deep autoencoders that can dissect and fully populate white matter bundles. This pipeline is built upon previous works that demonstrated how autoencoders can be used successfully for streamline filtering, bundle segmentation, and streamline generation in tractography. Our proposed method improves bundle segmentation coverage by recovering hard-to-track bundles with generative sampling through the latent space seeding of the subject bundle and the atlas bundle. A latent space of streamlines is learned using autoencoder-based modeling combined with contrastive learning. Using an atlas of bundles in standard space (MNI), our proposed method segments new tractograms using the autoencoder latent distance between each tractogram streamline and its closest neighbor bundle in the atlas of bundles. Intra-subject bundle reliability is improved by recovering hard-to-track streamlines, using the autoencoder to generate new streamlines that increase the spatial coverage of each bundle while remaining anatomically correct. Results show that our method is more reliable than state-of-the-art automated virtual dissection methods such as RecoBundles, RecoBundlesX, TractSeg, White Matter Analysis and XTRACT. Our framework allows for the transition from one anatomical bundle definition to another with marginal calibration efforts. Overall, these results show that our framework improves the practicality and usability of current state-of-the-art bundle segmentation framework.",2023,Autoencoder; Bundle segmentation; Fiber tractography; Generative sampling; Representation learning; dMRI,"Humans; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; White Matter; Dissection; Brain","Dumais, F; Legarreta, JH; Lemaire, C; Poulin, P; Rheault, F; Petit, L; Barakovic, M; Magon, S; Descoteaux, M; Jodoin, PM"
AI Body Composition in Lung Cancer Screening: Added Value Beyond Lung Cancer Detection.,"Background An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm has been developed for fully automated body composition assessment of lung cancer screening noncontrast low-dose CT of the chest (LDCT) scans, but the utility of these measurements in disease risk prediction models has not been assessed. Purpose To evaluate the added value of CT-based AI-derived body composition measurements in risk prediction of lung cancer incidence, lung cancer death, cardiovascular disease (CVD) death, and all-cause mortality in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the NLST, body composition measurements, including area and attenuation attributes of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue, were derived from baseline LDCT examinations by using a previously developed AI algorithm. The added value of these measurements was assessed with sex- and cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with and without the AI-derived body composition measurements for predicting lung cancer incidence, lung cancer death, CVD death, and all-cause mortality. Models were adjusted for confounding variables including age; body mass index; quantitative emphysema; coronary artery calcification; history of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke; and other PLCO",2023,,Female; Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Early Detection of Cancer; Lung Neoplasms; Artificial Intelligence; Cardiovascular Diseases; Body Composition; Lung,"Xu, K; Khan, MS; Li, TZ; Gao, R; Terry, JG; Huo, Y; Lasko, TA; Carr, JJ; Maldonado, F; Landman, BA; Sandler, KL"
Automated Classification of Cognitive Decline and Probable Alzheimer's Dementia Across Multiple Speech and Language Domains.,"Decline in language has emerged as a new potential biomarker for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Evaluating cPILOT Data toward Quality Control Implementation.,"Multiplexing enables the monitoring of hundreds to thousands of proteins in quantitative proteomics analyses and increases sample throughput. In most mass-spectrometry-based proteomics workflows, multiplexing is achieved by labeling biological samples with heavy isotopes via precursor isotopic labeling or isobaric tagging. Enhanced multiplexing strategies, such as combined precursor isotopic labeling and isobaric tagging (cPILOT), combine multiple technologies to afford an even higher sample throughput. Critical to enhanced multiplexing analyses is ensuring that analytical performance is optimal and that missingness of sample channels is minimized. Automation of sample preparation steps and use of quality control (QC) metrics can be incorporated into multiplexing analyses and reduce the likelihood of missing information, thus maximizing the amount of usable quantitative data. Here, we implemented QC metrics previously developed in our laboratory to evaluate a 36-plex cPILOT experiment that encompassed 144 mouse samples of various tissue types, time points, genotypes, and biological replicates. The evaluation focuses on the use of a sample pool generated from all samples in the experiment to monitor the daily instrument performance and to provide a means for data normalization across sample batches. Our results show that tracking QC metrics enabled the quantification of ∼7000 proteins in each sample batch, of which ∼70% had minimal missing values across up to 36 sample channels. Implementation of QC metrics for future cPILOT studies as well as other enhanced multiplexing strategies will help yield high-quality data sets.",2023,TMT; cPILOT; multiplexing; quality control; quantitative proteomics,Mice; Animals; Proteins; Mass Spectrometry; Proteomics; Isotope Labeling; Quality Control; Proteome,"Bowser, BL; Patterson, KL; Robinson, RA"
A novel framework of MOPSO-GDM in recognition of Alzheimer's EEG-based functional network.,"Most patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have an insidious onset and frequently atypical clinical symptoms, which are considered a normal consequence of aging, making it difficult to diagnose AD medically.

Neurons on tape: Automated Tape Collecting Ultramicrotomy-mediated volume EM for targeting neuropathology.,"In this chapter, we review Automated Tape Collecting Ultramicrotomy (ATUM), which, among other array tomography methods, substantially simplified large-scale volume electron microscopy (vEM) projects. vEM reveals biological structures at nanometer resolution in three dimensions and resolves ambiguities of two-dimensional representations. However, as the structures of interest-like disease hallmarks emerging from neuropathology-are often rare but the field of view is small, this can easily turn a vEM project into a needle in a haystack problem. One solution for this is correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM), providing tissue context, dynamic and molecular features before switching to targeted vEM to hone in on the object's ultrastructure. This requires precise coordinate transfer between the two imaging modalities (e.g., by micro computed tomography), especially for block face vEM which relies on physical destruction of sections. With array tomography methods, serial ultrathin sections are collected into a tissue library, thus allowing storage of precious samples like human biopsies and enabling repetitive imaging at different resolution levels for an SEM-based search strategy. For this, ATUM has been developed to reliably collect serial ultrathin sections via a conveyor belt onto a plastic tape that is later mounted onto silicon wafers for serial scanning EM (SEM). The ATUM-SEM procedure is highly modular and can be divided into sample preparation, serial ultramicrotomy onto tape, mounting, serial image acquisition-after which the acquired image stacks can be used for analysis. Here, we describe the steps of this workflow and how ATUM-SEM enables targeting and high resolution imaging of specific structures. ATUM-SEM is widely applicable. To illustrate this, we exemplify the approach by reconstructions of focal pathology in an Alzheimer mouse model and CLEM of a specific cortical synapse.",2023,ATUM; Alzheimer ‘s disease; Array tomography; CLEM; Correlation; Neuroscience; Plaques; SEM; Targeting,"Mice; Animals; Humans; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Volume Electron Microscopy; X-Ray Microtomography; Microtomy; Neurons; Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Kislinger, G; Niemann, C; Rodriguez, L; Jiang, H; Fard, MK; Snaidero, N; Schumacher, AM; Kerschensteiner, M; Misgeld, T; Schifferer, M"
Structurally and Morphologically Distinct Pathological Tau Assemblies Differentially Affect GVB Accumulation.,"Tau aggregation is central to the pathogenesis of a large group of neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies, but it is still unclear in which way neurons respond to tau pathology and how tau accumulation leads to neurodegeneration. A striking neuron-specific response to tau pathology is presented by granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs), lysosomal structures that accumulate specific cargo in a dense core. Here we employed different tau aggregation models in primary neurons to investigate which properties of pathological tau assemblies affect GVB accumulation using a combination of confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and quantitative automated high-content microscopy. Employing GFP-tagged and untagged tau variants that spontaneously form intraneuronal aggregates, we induced pathological tau assemblies with a distinct subcellular localization, morphology, and ultrastructure depending on the presence or absence of the GFP tag. The quantification of the GVB load in the different models showed that an increased GVB accumulation is associated with the untagged tau aggregation model, characterized by shorter and more randomly distributed tau filaments in the neuronal soma. Our data indicate that tau aggregate structure and/or subcellular localization may be key determinants of GVB accumulation.",2023,Tau; aggregation; granulovacuolar degeneration bodies; neurodegenerative disease,Humans; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Neurons; Nerve Degeneration; Alzheimer Disease; Brain,"Jorge-Oliva, M; van Weering, JRT; Scheper, W"
inMTSCCA: An Integrated Multi-task Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multi-omic Brain Imaging Genetics.,"Identifying genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. To date, different endophenotypes, such as imaging-derived endophenotypes and proteomic expression-derived endophenotypes, have shown the great value in uncovering risk genes compared to case-control studies. Biologically, a co-varying pattern of different omics-derived endophenotypes could result from the shared genetic basis. However, existing methods mainly focus on the effect of endophenotypes alone; the effect of cross-endophenotype (CEP) associations remains largely unexploited. In this study, we used both endophenotypes and their CEP associations of multi-omic data to identify genetic risk factors, and proposed two integrated multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis (inMTSCCA) methods, i.e., pairwise endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (pcMTSCCA) and high-order endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (hocMTSCCA). pcMTSCCA employed pairwise correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived, plasma-derived, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived endophenotypes as an additional penalty. hocMTSCCA used high-order correlations among these multi-omic data for regularization. To figure out genetic risk factors at individual and group levels, as well as altered endophenotypic markers, we introduced sparsity-inducing penalties for both models. We compared pcMTSCCA and hocMTSCCA with three related methods on both simulation and real (consisting of neuroimaging data, proteomic analytes, and genetic data) datasets. The results showed that our methods obtained better or comparable canonical correlation coefficients (CCCs) and better feature subsets than benchmarks. Most importantly, the identified genetic loci and heterogeneous endophenotypic markers showed high relevance. Therefore, jointly using multi-omic endophenotypes and their CEP associations is promising to reveal genetic risk factors.

Explainable Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Linguistic Features from Automatic Speech Recognition.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia and can cause abnormal cognitive function and progressive loss of essential life skills. Early screening is thus necessary for the prevention and intervention of AD. Speech dysfunction is an early onset symptom of AD patients. Recent studies have demonstrated the promise of automated acoustic assessment using acoustic or linguistic features extracted from speech. However, most previous studies have relied on manual transcription of text to extract linguistic features, which weakens the efficiency of automated assessment. The present study thus investigates the effectiveness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in building an end-to-end automated speech analysis model for AD detection.",2023,ADReSS; Alzheimer’s disease; Automatic speech recognition; Ensemble learning; Linguistic features,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech Perception; Linguistics; Speech; Cognition,"Tang, L; Zhang, Z; Feng, F; Yang, LZ; Li, H"
A Causality-Aware Graph Convolutional Network Framework for Rigidity Assessment in Parkinsonians.,"Rigidity is one of the common motor disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD), which lead to life quality deterioration. The widely-used rating-scale-based approach for rigidity assessment still depends on the availability of experienced neurologists and is limited by rating subjectivity. Given the recent successful applications of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in auxiliary PD diagnosis, automated assessment of PD rigidity can be essentially achieved through QSM analysis. However, a major challenge is the performance instability due to the confounding factors (e.g., noise and distribution shift) which conceal the truly-causal features. Therefore, we propose a causality-aware graph convolutional network (GCN) framework, where causal feature selection is combined with causal invariance to ensure that causality-informed model decisions are reached. Firstly, a GCN model that integrates causal feature selection is systematically constructed at three graph levels: node, structure, and representation. In this model, a causal diagram is learned to extract a subgraph with truly-causal information. Secondly, a non-causal perturbation strategy is developed along with an invariance constraint to ensure the stability of the assessment results under different distributions, and thus avoid spurious correlations caused by distribution shifts. The superiority of the proposed method is shown by extensive experiments and the clinical value is revealed by the direct relevance of selected brain regions to rigidity in PD. Besides, its extensibility is verified on other two tasks: PD bradykinesia and mental state for Alzheimer's disease. Overall, we provide a clinically-potential tool for automated and stable assessment of PD rigidity.

A computational suite for the structural and functional characterization of amyloid aggregates.,"We developed the aggregate characterization toolkit (ACT), a fully automated computational suite based on existing and widely used core algorithms to measure the number, size, and permeabilizing activity of recombinant and human-derived aggregates imaged with diffraction-limited and super-resolution microscopy methods at high throughput. We have validated ACT on simulated ground-truth images of aggregates mimicking those from diffraction-limited and super-resolution microscopies and showcased its use in characterizing protein aggregates from Alzheimer's disease. ACT is developed for high-throughput batch processing of images collected from multiple samples and is available as an open-source code. Given its accuracy, speed, and accessibility, ACT is expected to be a fundamental tool in studying human and non-human amyloid intermediates, developing early disease stage diagnostics, and screening for antibodies that bind toxic and heterogeneous human amyloid aggregates.",2023,Image processing; analysis automation; fluorescence microscopy; neurodegenerative disease; protein aggregate characterisation; super-resolution imaging,Humans; Protein Aggregates; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Algorithms,"Xia, Z; Wu, Y; Lam, JYL; Zhang, Z; Burke, M; Fertan, E; Ranasinghe, RT; Hidari, E; Danial, JSH; Klenerman, D"

EEG-based classification of individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders using deep neural networks: A systematic review of current status and future directions.,"The use of deep neural networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has rapidly progressed and gained popularity in recent years, but automatic feature extraction from EEG signals remains a challenging task. The classification of neuropsychiatric disorders demands the extraction of neuro-markers for use in automated EEG classification. Numerous advanced deep learning algorithms can be used for this purpose. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the main factors and parameters that affect the performance of deep neural networks in classifying different neuropsychiatric disorders using EEG signals. We also analyze the EEG features used for improving classification performance. Our analysis includes 82 scientific journal papers that applied deep neural networks for subject-wise classification based on EEG signals. We extracted information on the EEG dataset and types of disorders, deep neural network structures, performance, and hyperparameters. The results show that most studies have focused on clinical classification, achieving an average accuracy of 91.83 ± 7.34, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being the most frequently used network architecture and resting-state EEG signals being the most commonly used data type. Additionally, the review reveals that depression (N = 18), Alzheimer's (N = 11), and schizophrenia (N = 11) were studied more frequently than other types of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our review provides insight into the performance of deep neural networks in EEG classification and highlights the importance of EEG feature extraction in improving classification accuracy. By identifying the main factors and parameters that affect deep neural network performance in EEG classification, our review can guide future research in this area. We hope that our findings will encourage further exploration of deep learning methods for EEG classification and contribute to the development of more accurate and effective methods for diagnosing and monitoring neuropsychiatric disorders using EEG signals.",2023,Brain activity; Conventional neural network; Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Neural network; Neuro-markers; Recurrent neural network,"Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Algorithms; Electroencephalography","Parsa, M; Rad, HY; Vaezi, H; Hossein-Zadeh, GA; Setarehdan, SK; Rostami, R; Rostami, H; Vahabie, AH"
Hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase activity regulates cerebral Aβ metabolism and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease in mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. However, how the role of peripheral organ changes in response to environmental stimuli during aging in AD pathogenesis remains unknown. Hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) activity increases with age. Hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally attenuates brain amyloid-β (Aβ) burden, tauopathy, and cognitive deficits in AD mouse models. Moreover, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma level of 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (-EET), which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and modulates brain Aβ metabolism through multiple pathways. A balance between the brain levels of 14,15-EET and Aβ is essential for preventing Aβ deposition. In AD models, 14,15-EET infusion mimicked the neuroprotective effects of hepatic sEH ablation at biological and behavioral levels. These results highlight the liver's key role in AD pathology, and targeting the liver-brain axis in response to environmental stimuli may constitute a promising therapeutic approach for AD prevention.",2023,"14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid; Alzheimer’s disease; apolipoprotein E; liver; soluble epoxide hydrolase","Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Epoxide Hydrolases; Liver","Wu, Y; Dong, JH; Dai, YF; Zhu, MZ; Wang, MY; Zhang, Y; Pan, YD; Yuan, XR; Guo, ZX; Wang, CX; Li, YQ; Zhu, XH"

fMRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using the SAS Method with Multi-Layer Perceptron Network.,"In the present scenario, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the incurable neuro-degenerative disorders, which accounts for nearly 60% to 70% of dementia cases. Currently, several machine-learning approaches and neuroimaging modalities are utilized for diagnosing AD. Among the available neuroimaging modalities, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is extensively utilized for studying brain activities related to AD. However, analyzing complex brain structures in fMRI is a time-consuming and complex task; so, a novel automated model was proposed in this manuscript for early diagnosis of AD using fMRI images. Initially, the fMRI images are acquired from an online dataset: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Further, the quality of the acquired fMRI images was improved by implementing a normalization technique. Then, the Segmentation by Aggregating Superpixels (SAS) method was implemented for segmenting the brain regions (AD, Normal Controls (NC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Significant Memory Concern (SMC)) from the denoised fMRI images. From the segmented brain regions, feature vectors were extracted by employing Gabor and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) techniques. The obtained feature vectors were dimensionally reduced by implementing Honey Badger Optimization Algorithm (HBOA) and fed to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for classifying the fMRI images as AD, NC, MCI, EMCI, LMCI, and SMC. The extensive investigation indicated that the presented model attained 99.44% of classification accuracy, 88.90% of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 90.82% of Jaccard Coefficient (JC), and 88.43% of Hausdorff Distance (HD). The attained results are better compared with the conventional segmentation and classification models.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Honey Badger Optimization Algorithm; Multi-Layer Perceptron; Superpixels; functional magnetic resonance imaging; normalization technique,,"Chelladurai, A; Narayan, DL; Divakarachari, PB; Loganathan, U"

Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Speech and language changes occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few studies have characterized their longitudinal course. We analyzed open-ended speech samples from a prodromal-to-mild AD cohort to develop a novel composite score to characterize progressive speech changes. Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD.

Diagnostic Biomarkers of Amyloid and Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease: An Overview of Tests for Clinical Practice in the United States and Europe.,"Amyloid and tau biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease are widely recognized diagnostic tools for the identification of Alzheimer's disease pathology antemortem and are recommended by the most recent clinical and research guidelines. Approved biomarkers include positron emission tomography (PET)- and fluid-based markers derived from cerebrospinal fluid and, more recently, plasma. These biomarkers are still infrequently used in clinical practice, potentially due to challenges in access to and understanding of individual assay information and methodology. We provide an overview of the diagnostic biomarkers for amyloid and tau pathology that are currently available in the US and/or EU for clinical use. Available performance data from both labels/instructions for use and the scientific literature (with focus on autopsy or PET as standard of truth) are summarized to help healthcare providers navigate the biomarker landscape. All available PET amyloid and tau biomarkers demonstrate high accuracy in identifying amyloid and tau Alzheimer's disease pathology, respectively, at autopsy. Among cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, all showed accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease pathology, either based on autopsy or PET findings; greater accuracy was evident for concentration ratios (Aβ42/40 or P-tau181/Aβ42) versus individual biomarker concentrations. Among plasma biomarkers, Aβ42/40 and P-tau181 demonstrated high agreement with PET findings. Overall, we conclude that commercially available PET, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma assays accurately identify Alzheimer's disease amyloid and tau pathology. The recent development of fully automated tests for fluid-based biomarkers improves test reliability. The continued development of plasma biomarkers holds promise for the future management of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; diagnostic biomarker; tau,Humans; United States; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Reproducibility of Results; Amyloid; Biomarkers,"Iaccarino, L; Burnham, SC; Dell'Agnello, G; Dowsett, SA; Epelbaum, S"

Using Health Forum Data to Assess User Needs for mHealth App Development: A Feasibility Study on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Online health forums are used by patients and caregivers as community and information resources, especially for chronic disease management, and could help determine user needs for digital health app design. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using online forum posts on Alzheimer's disease to inform user needs in mobile health application design and whether this process can be automated through text clustering methods. A total of 413 posts were analyzed manually through thematic coding and yielded three themes and nine subthemes for patient and caregiver needs. The external evaluation showed fair to substantial similarity between the automatically and manually derived labels. Four personas were developed to assess the validity of forum-generated needs. These results establish that health forum data can provide sufficient information to understand user needs. However, further refinement of the analysis process and algorithm is necessary to generalize this method to other disease conditions and types of forum data.",2023,,,"Wu, DTY; Bindhu, S; Vu, H; Mu, S; Xu, C; Pandey, S; Harnett, B; Lee, JJ"
Comparing Amyloid Imaging Normalization Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease Classification using an Automated Machine Learning Pipeline.,"Amyloid imaging has been widely used in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and biomarker discovery through detecting the regional amyloid plaque density. It is essential to be normalized by a reference region to reduce noise and artifacts. To explore an optimal normalization strategy, we employ an automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline, STREAMLINE, to conduct the AD diagnosis binary classification and perform permutation-based feature importance analysis with thirteen machine learning models. In this work, we perform a comparative study to evaluate the prediction performance and biomarker discovery capability of three amyloid imaging measures, including one original measure and two normalized measures using two reference regions (i.e., the whole cerebellum and the composite reference region). Our AutoML results indicate that the composite reference region normalization dataset yields a higher balanced accuracy, and identifies more AD-related regions based on the fractioned feature importance ranking.",2023,,,"Tong, B; Risacher, SL; Bao, J; Feng, Y; Wang, X; Ritchie, MD; Moore, JH; Urbanowicz, R; Saykin, AJ; Shen, L"

"Perivascular spaces in Alzheimer's disease are associated with inflammatory, stress-related, and hypertension biomarkers.","Perivascular spaces (PVS) are fluid-filled spaces surrounding the brain vasculature. Literature suggests that PVS may play a significant role in aging and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cortisol, a stress hormone, has been implicated in the development and progression of AD. Hypertension, a common condition in older adults, has been found to be a risk factor for AD. Hypertension may contribute to PVS enlargement, impairing the clearance of waste products from the brain and promoting neuroinflammation. This study aims to understand the potential interactions between PVS, cortisol, hypertension, and inflammation in the context of cognitive impairment. Using MRI scans acquired at 1.5T, PVS were quantified in a cohort of 465 individuals with cognitive impairment. PVS was calculated in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale using an automated segmentation approach. Levels of cortisol and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (an indicator of hypertension) were measured from plasma. Inflammatory biomarkers, such as cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, were analyzed using advanced laboratory techniques. Main effect and interaction analyses were performed to examine the associations between PVS severity, cortisol levels, hypertension, and inflammatory biomarkers. In the centrum semiovale, higher levels of inflammation reduced cortisol associations with PVS volume fraction. For ACE, an inverse association with PVS was seen only when interacting with TNFr2 (a transmembrane receptor of TNF). There was also a significant inverse main effect of TNFr2. In the PVS basal ganglia, a significant positive association was found with TRAIL (a TNF receptor inducing apoptosis). These findings show for the first time the intricate relationships between PVS structure and the levels of stress-related, hypertension, and inflammatory biomarkers. This research could potentially guide future studies regarding the underlying mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and the potential development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these inflammation factors.",2023,,,"Sibilia, F; Sheikh-Bahaei, N; Mack, WJ; Choupan, J"
Biomedical knowledge graph learning for drug repurposing by extending guilt-by-association to multiple layers.,"Computational drug repurposing aims to identify new indications for existing drugs by utilizing high-throughput data, often in the form of biomedical knowledge graphs. However, learning on biomedical knowledge graphs can be challenging due to the dominance of genes and a small number of drug and disease entities, resulting in less effective representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a ""semantic multi-layer guilt-by-association"" approach that leverages the principle of guilt-by-association - ""similar genes share similar functions"", at the drug-gene-disease level. Using this approach, our model DREAMwalk: Drug Repurposing through Exploring Associations using Multi-layer random walk uses our semantic information-guided random walk to generate drug and disease-populated node sequences, allowing for effective mapping of both drugs and diseases in a unified embedding space. Compared to state-of-the-art link prediction models, our approach improves drug-disease association prediction accuracy by up to 16.8%. Moreover, exploration of the embedding space reveals a well-aligned harmony between biological and semantic contexts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through repurposing case studies for breast carcinoma and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the potential of multi-layer guilt-by-association perspective for drug repurposing on biomedical knowledge graphs.",2023,,"Drug Repositioning; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Learning","Bang, D; Lim, S; Lee, S; Kim, S"
A new weakly supervised deep neural network for recognizing Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects older adults, causing memory loss and decline in thinking skills. In recent years, many traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have been used to assist in the diagnosis of AD, and most existing methods focus on early prediction of disease on a supervised basis. In reality, there is a massive amount of medical data available. However, some of those data have problems with the low-quality or lack of labels, and the cost of labeling them will be too high. To solve above problem, a new Weakly Supervised Deep Learning model (WSDL) is proposed, which adds attention mechanisms and consistency regularization to the EfficientNet framework and uses data augmentation techniques on the original data that can take full advantage of this unlabeled data. Validation of the proposed WSDL method on the brain MRI datasets of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Program by setting five different unlabeled ratios to complete weakly supervised training showed better performance according to the compared experimental results with others baselines.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Deep learning (DL); Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Unlabeled data; Weakly supervised learning,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Machine Learning","Zhang, X; Li, Z; Zhang, Q; Yin, Z; Lu, Z; Li, Y"

A face-off of MRI research sequences by their need for de-facing.,"It is now widely known that research brain MRI, CT, and PET images may potentially be re-identified using face recognition, and this potential can be reduced by applying face-deidentification (""de-facing"") software. However, for research MRI sequences beyond T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2-FLAIR structural images, the potential for re-identification and quantitative effects of de-facing are both unknown, and the effects of de-facing T2-FLAIR are also unknown. In this work we examine these questions (where applicable) for T1-w, T2-w, T2*-w, T2-FLAIR, diffusion MRI (dMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and arterial spin labelling (ASL) sequences. Among current-generation, vendor-product research-grade sequences, we found that 3D T1-w, T2-w, and T2-FLAIR were highly re-identifiable (96-98%). 2D T2-FLAIR and 3D multi-echo GRE (ME-GRE) were also moderately re-identifiable (44-45%), and our derived T2* from ME-GRE (comparable to a typical 2D T2*) matched at only 10%. Finally, diffusion, functional and ASL images were each minimally re-identifiable (0-8%). Applying de-facing with mri_reface version 0.3 reduced successful re-identification to ≤8%, while differential effects on popular quantitative pipelines for cortical volumes and thickness, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) measurements were all either comparable with or smaller than scan-rescan estimates. Consequently, high-quality de-facing software can greatly reduce the risk of re-identification for identifiable MRI sequences with only negligible effects on automated intracranial measurements. The current-generation echo-planar and spiral sequences (dMRI, fMRI, and ASL) each had minimal match rates, suggesting that they have a low risk of re-identification and can be shared without de-facing, but this conclusion should be re-evaluated if they are acquired without fat suppression, with a full-face scan coverage, or if newer developments reduce the current levels of artifacts and distortion around the face.",2023,Anonymization; De-facing; De-identification; Face recognition; MRI; dMRI; fMRI,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Artifacts; Spin Labels,"Schwarz, CG; Kremers, WK; Arani, A; Savvides, M; Reid, RI; Gunter, JL; Senjem, ML; Cogswell, PM; Vemuri, P; Kantarci, K; Knopman, DS; Petersen, RC; Jack, CR"
Primate brain pattern-based automated Alzheimer's disease detection model using EEG signals.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) may detect early changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disease. We have developed an automated AD detection model using a novel directed graph for local texture feature extraction with EEG signals. The proposed graph was created from a topological map of the macroscopic connectome, i.e., neuronal pathways linking anatomo-functional brain segments involved in visual object recognition and motor response in the primate brain. This primate brain pattern (PBP)-based model was tested on a public AD EEG signal dataset. The dataset comprised 16-channel EEG signal recordings of 12 AD patients and 11 healthy controls. While PBP could generate 448 low-level features per one-dimensional EEG signal, combining it with tunable q-factor wavelet transform created a multilevel feature extractor (which mimicked deep models) to generate 8,512 (= 448 × 19) features per signal input. Iterative neighborhood component analysis was used to choose the most discriminative features (the number of optimal features varied among the individual EEG channels) to feed to a weighted k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for binary classification into AD vs. healthy using both leave-one subject-out (LOSO) and tenfold cross-validations. Iterative majority voting was used to compute subject-level general performance results from the individual channel classification outputs. Channel-wise, as well as subject-level general results demonstrated exemplary performance. In addition, the model attained 100% and 92.01% accuracy for AD vs. healthy classification using the KNN classifier with tenfold and LOSO cross-validations, respectively. Our developed multilevel PBP-based model extracted discriminative features from EEG signals and paved the way for further development of models inspired by the brain connectome.",2023,AD detection; EEG signal classification; Feature engineering; Feature extraction; Primate brain modelling,,"Dogan, S; Baygin, M; Tasci, B; Loh, HW; Barua, PD; Tuncer, T; Tan, RS; Acharya, UR"

"An automated, geometry-based method for hippocampal shape and thickness analysis.","The hippocampus is one of the most studied neuroanatomical structures due to its involvement in attention, learning, and memory as well as its atrophy in ageing, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. Hippocampal shape changes, however, are complex and cannot be fully characterized by a single summary metric such as hippocampal volume as determined from MR images. In this work, we propose an automated, geometry-based approach for the unfolding, point-wise correspondence, and local analysis of hippocampal shape features such as thickness and curvature. Starting from an automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields, we create a 3D tetrahedral mesh model as well as a 3D intrinsic coordinate system of the hippocampal body. From this coordinate system, we derive local curvature and thickness estimates as well as a 2D sheet for hippocampal unfolding. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm with a series of experiments to quantify neurodegenerative changes in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia. We find that hippocampal thickness estimates detect known differences between clinical groups and can determine the location of these effects on the hippocampal sheet. Further, thickness estimates improve classification of clinical groups and cognitively unimpaired controls when added as an additional predictor. Comparable results are obtained with different datasets and segmentation algorithms. Taken together, we replicate canonical findings on hippocampal volume/shape changes in dementia, extend them by gaining insight into their spatial localization on the hippocampal sheet, and provide additional, complementary information beyond traditional measures. We provide a new set of sensitive processing and analysis tools for the analysis of hippocampal geometry that allows comparisons across studies without relying on image registration or requiring manual intervention.",2023,Flattening; Hippocampus; Neuroimaging; Shape analysis; Thickness,"Hippocampus; Organ Size; Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Datasets as Topic; Algorithms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging","Diers, K; Baumeister, H; Jessen, F; Düzel, E; Berron, D; Reuter, M"

The radiomics features of the temporal lobe region related to menopause based on MR-T2WI can be used as potential biomarkers for AD.,"Menopause may be an important pathogenic factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The M1 polarization of microglia and neuroinflammatory responses occur in the early pathogenetic stages of AD. Currently, no effective monitoring markers are available for AD's early pathological manifestations. Radiomics is an automated feature generation method for the extraction of hundreds of quantitative phenotypes (radiomics features) from radiology images. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the magnetic resonance T2-weighted imaging (MR-T2WI) on the temporal lobe region and clinical data of both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. There were three significant differences were identified for select radiomic features in the temporal lobe between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, i.e. the texture feature Original-glcm-Idn (OI) based on the Original image, the filter-based first-order feature Log-firstorder-Mean (LM), and the texture feature Wavelet-LHH-glrlm-Run Length Nonuniformity (WLR). In humans, these three features were significantly correlated with the timing of menopause. In mice, these features were also different between the sham and ovariectomy (OVX) groups and were significantly associated with neuronal damage, microglial M1 polarization, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline in the OVX groups. In AD patients, OI was significantly associated with cognitive decline, while LM was associated with anxiety and depression. OI and WLR could distinguish AD from healthy controls. In conclusion, radiomics features based on brain MR-T2WI scans have the potential to serve as biomarkers for AD and noninvasive monitoring of pathological progression in the temporal lobe of the brain in women undergoing menopause.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; MR-T2WI; menopausal women; microglia; radiomic features,Humans; Female; Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Retrospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biomarkers; Temporal Lobe; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Menopause,"Li, M; Zhang, J; Shi, Y; Liu, S; Liu, X; Ning, Y; Cao, Y; Deng, Y; Zhao, Y"
Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease: Potential and Perspectives.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a global health challenge in the 21st century due to its increasing prevalence as the major cause of dementia. State-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI)-based tests could potentially improve population-based strategies to detect and manage AD. Current retinal imaging demonstrates immense potential as a non-invasive screening measure for AD, by studying qualitative and quantitative changes in the neuronal and vascular structures of the retina that are often associated with degenerative changes in the brain. On the other hand, the tremendous success of AI, especially deep learning, in recent years has encouraged its incorporation with retinal imaging for predicting systemic diseases. Further development in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), defined as a subfield of machine learning that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning, also prompts the question of how it can work hand in hand with retinal imaging as a viable tool for automated prediction of AD. This review aims to discuss potential applications of DRL in using retinal imaging to study AD, and their synergistic application to unlock other possibilities, such as AD detection and prediction of AD progression. Challenges and future directions, such as the use of inverse DRL in defining reward function, lack of standardization in retinal imaging, and data availability, will also be addressed to bridge gaps for its transition into clinical use.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; deep reinforcement learning; reinforcement learning; retinal imaging,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Retina; Machine Learning,"Hui, HYH; Ran, AR; Dai, JJ; Cheung, CY"

An 8-cage imaging system for automated analyses of mouse behavior.,"The analysis of mouse behavior is used in biomedical research to study brain function in health and disease. Well-established rapid assays allow for high-throughput analyses of behavior but have several drawbacks, including measurements of daytime behaviors in nocturnal animals, effects of animal handling, and the lack of an acclimation period in the testing apparatus. We developed a novel 8-cage imaging system, with animated visual stimuli, for automated analyses of mouse behavior in 22-h overnight recordings. Software for image analysis was developed in two open-source programs, ImageJ and DeepLabCut. The imaging system was tested using 4-5 month-old female wild-type mice and 3xTg-AD mice, a widely-used model to study Alzheimer's disease (AD). The overnight recordings provided measurements of multiple behaviors including acclimation to the novel cage environment, day and nighttime activity, stretch-attend postures, location in various cage areas, and habituation to animated visual stimuli. The behavioral profiles were different in wild-type and 3xTg-AD mice. AD-model mice displayed reduced acclimation to the novel cage environment, were hyperactive during the first hour of darkness, and spent less time at home in comparison to wild-type mice. We propose that the imaging system may be used to study various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Female; Alzheimer Disease; Mice, Transgenic; Motor Activity; Behavior, Animal; Software; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Inbred C57BL","Del Rosario Hernández, T; Joshi, NR; Gore, SV; Kreiling, JA; Creton, R"

Do Epilepsy Patients with Cognitive Impairment Have Alzheimer's Disease-like Brain Metabolism?,"Although not classically considered together, there is emerging evidence that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy share a number of features and that each disease predisposes patients to developing the other.

In this retrospective chart review study, we investigated if epilepsy patients with/without mild cognitive symptoms also show AD-like metabolic patterns determined by the MAD algorithm. Scans from a total of 20 patients with epilepsy were included in this study. Because AD diagnoses are made late in life, only patients aged ≥40 years were considered.

Metapaths: similarity search in heterogeneous knowledge graphs via meta-paths.,"Heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs) have enabled the modeling of complex systems, from genetic interaction graphs and protein-protein interaction networks to networks representing drugs, diseases, proteins, and side effects. Analytical methods for KGs rely on quantifying similarities between entities, such as nodes, in the graph. However, such methods must consider the diversity of node and edge types contained within the KG via, for example, defined sequences of entity types known as meta-paths. We present metapaths, the first R software package to implement meta-paths and perform meta-path-based similarity search in heterogeneous KGs. The metapaths package offers various built-in similarity metrics for node pair comparison by querying KGs represented as either edge or adjacency lists, as well as auxiliary aggregation methods to measure set-level relationships. Indeed, evaluation of these methods on an open-source biomedical KG recovered meaningful drug and disease-associated relationships, including those in Alzheimer's disease.

In this paper, we implement the EfficietNet-b0 convolutional neural network (CNN) with a novel approach-""fusion of end-to-end and transfer learning""-to classify different stages of AD. 245 T1W MRI scans of cognitively normal (CN) subjects, 229 scans of AD subjects, and 229 scans of subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) were employed. Each scan was preprocessed using a standard pipeline. The proposed models were trained and evaluated using preprocessed scans. For the sMCI vs. AD classification task we obtained 95.29% accuracy and 95.35% area under the curve (AUC) for model training and 93.10% accuracy and 93.00% AUC for model testing. For the multiclass AD vs. CN vs. sMCI classification task we obtained 85.66% accuracy and 86% AUC for model training and 87.38% accuracy and 88.00% AUC for model testing. Based on our experimental results, we conclude that CNN-based DL models can be used to analyze complicated MRI scan features in clinical settings.",2023,Alzheimer´s disease; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; EfficientNet; MONAI; MRI; Mild cognitive impairment; Transfer learning,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Early Diagnosis; Cognitive Dysfunction","Agarwal, D; Berbís, MÁ; Luna, A; Lipari, V; Ballester, JB; de la Torre-Díez, I"
Characterization of an automated method to segment the human locus coeruleus.,"Following the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to assay the integrity of catecholamine nuclei, including the locus coeruleus (LC), there has been an effort to develop automated methods that can accurately segment this small structure in an automated manner to promote its widespread use and overcome limitations of manual segmentation. Here we characterize an automated LC segmentation approach (referred to as the funnel-tip [FT] method) in healthy individuals and individuals with LC degeneration in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD, confirmed with tau-PET imaging using [18F]MK6240). The first sample included n = 190 individuals across the AD spectrum from cognitively normal to moderate AD. LC signal assayed with FT segmentation showed excellent agreement with manual segmentation (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.91). Compared to other methods, the FT method showed numerically higher correlation to AD status (defined by presence of tau: Cohen's d = 0.64) and AD severity (Braak stage: Pearson R = -.35, cognitive function: R = .25). In a separate sample of n = 12 control participants, the FT method showed excellent scan-rescan reliability (ICC = 0.82). In another sample of n = 30 control participants, we found that the structure of the LC defined by FT segmentation approximated its expected shape as a contiguous line: <5% of LC voxels strayed >1 voxel (0.69 mm) from this line. The FT LC segmentation shows high agreement with manual segmentation and captures LC degeneration in AD. This practical method may facilitate larger research studies of the human LC-norepinephrine system and has potential to support future use of neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a clinical biomarker.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; automated; locus coeruleus; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); norepinephrine system; segmentation,Humans; Locus Coeruleus; Reproducibility of Results; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Norepinephrine,"Sibahi, A; Gandhi, R; Al-Haddad, R; Therriault, J; Pascoal, T; Chamoun, M; Boutin-Miller, K; Tardif, C; Rosa-Neto, P; Cassidy, CM"
The Power of ECG in Semi-Automated Seizure Detection in Addition to Two-Channel behind-the-Ear EEG.,"Long-term home monitoring of people living with epilepsy cannot be achieved using the standard full-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) coupled with video. Wearable seizure detection devices, such as behind-the-ear EEG (bte-EEG), offer an unobtrusive method for ambulatory follow-up of this population. Combining bte-EEG with electrocardiography (ECG) can enhance automated seizure detection performance. However, such frameworks produce high false alarm rates, making visual review necessary. This study aimed to evaluate a semi-automated multimodal wearable seizure detection framework using bte-EEG and ECG. Using the SeizeIT1 dataset of 42 patients with focal epilepsy, an automated multimodal seizure detection algorithm was used to produce seizure alarms. Two reviewers evaluated the algorithm's detections twice: (1) using only bte-EEG data and (2) using bte-EEG, ECG, and heart rate signals. The readers achieved a mean sensitivity of 59.1% in the bte-EEG visual experiment, with a false detection rate of 6.5 false detections per day. Adding ECG resulted in a higher mean sensitivity (62.2%) and a largely reduced false detection rate (mean of 2.4 false detections per day), as well as an increased inter-rater agreement. The multimodal framework allows for efficient review time, making it beneficial for both clinicians and patients.",2023,ECG; behind-the-ear EEG; epilepsy; ictal heart rate; multimodal; seizure detection,,"Bhagubai, M; Vandecasteele, K; Swinnen, L; Macea, J; Chatzichristos, C; De Vos, M; Van Paesschen, W"

Causal feature selection using a knowledge graph combining structured knowledge from the biomedical literature and ontologies: A use case studying depression as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.,"Causal feature selection is essential for estimating effects from observational data. Identifying confounders is a crucial step in this process. Traditionally, researchers employ content-matter expertise and literature review to identify confounders. Uncontrolled confounding from unidentified confounders threatens validity, conditioning on intermediate variables (mediators) weakens estimates, and conditioning on common effects (colliders) induces bias. Additionally, without special treatment, erroneous conditioning on variables combining roles introduces bias. However, the vast literature is growing exponentially, making it infeasible to assimilate this knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel knowledge graph (KG) application enabling causal feature selection by combining computable literature-derived knowledge with biomedical ontologies. We present a use case of our approach specifying a causal model for estimating the total causal effect of depression on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from observational data.",2023,"Alzheimer’s disease; Causal modeling; Depression; Feature selection; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge representation, management, or engineering","Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Depression; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Causality; Risk Factors","Malec, SA; Taneja, SB; Albert, SM; Elizabeth Shaaban, C; Karim, HT; Levine, AS; Munro, P; Callahan, TJ; Boyce, RD"
Effects of storage conditions on the stability of blood-based markers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most common cause of dementia in older people. Recently, blood-based markers (BBM) Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, and phospho Tau181 (p-Tau181) have demonstrated the potential to transform the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of AD. Our aim was to investigate the effect of different storage conditions on the quantification of these BBM and to evaluate the interchangeability of plasma and serum samples.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; automated platforms; blood-based markers; plasma; preanalytical phase; serum; tau,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Retrospective Studies; Biomarkers,"Mansilla, A; Canyelles, M; Ferrer, R; Arranz, J; Rodríguez-Baz, Í; Zhu, N; Rubio-Guerra, S; El Bounasri, S; Sánchez, O; Torres, S; Fortea, J; Lleó, A; Alcolea, D; Tondo, M"
Age-related and amyloid-beta-independent tau deposition and its downstream effects.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) is hypothesized to facilitate the spread of tau pathology beyond the medial temporal lobe. However, there is evidence that, independently of Aβ, age-related tau pathology might be present outside of the medial temporal lobe. We therefore aimed to study age-related Aβ-independent tau deposition outside the medial temporal lobe in two large cohorts and to investigate potential downstream effects of this on cognition and structural measures. We included 545 cognitively unimpaired adults (40-92 years) from the BioFINDER-2 study (in vivo) and 639 (64-108 years) from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (ex vivo). 18F-RO948- and 18F-flutemetamol-PET standardized uptake value ratios were calculated for regional tau and global/regional Aβ in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was used to estimate Aβ load and tangle density ex vivo. In vivo medial temporal lobe volumes (subiculum, cornu ammonis 1) and cortical thickness (entorhinal cortex, Brodmann area 35) were obtained using Automated Segmentation for Hippocampal Subfields packages. Thickness of early and late neocortical Alzheimer's disease regions was determined using FreeSurfer. Global cognition and episodic memory were estimated to quantify cognitive functioning. In vivo age-related tau deposition was observed in the medial temporal lobe and in frontal and parietal cortical regions, which was statistically significant when adjusting for Aβ. This was also observed in individuals with low Aβ load. Tau deposition was negatively associated with cortical volumes and thickness in temporal and parietal regions independently of Aβ. The associations between age and cortical volume or thickness were partially mediated via tau in regions with early Alzheimer's disease pathology, i.e. early tau and/or Aβ pathology (subiculum/Brodmann area 35/precuneus/posterior cingulate). Finally, the associations between age and cognition were partially mediated via tau in Brodmann area 35, even when including Aβ-PET as covariate. Results were validated in the ex vivo cohort showing age-related and Aβ-independent increases in tau aggregates in and outside the medial temporal lobe. Ex vivo age-cognition associations were mediated by medial and inferior temporal tau tangle density, while correcting for Aβ density. Taken together, our study provides support for primary age-related tauopathy even outside the medial temporal lobe in vivo and ex vivo, with downstream effects on structure and cognition. These results have implications for our understanding of the spreading of tau outside the medial temporal lobe, also in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, this study suggests the potential utility of tau-targeting treatments in primary age-related tauopathy, likely already in preclinical stages in individuals with low Aβ pathology.",2023,MRI; PART; ageing; amyloid-beta; autoradiography; medial temporal lobe subregions; tau-PET imaging,Adult; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Tauopathies; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Wuestefeld, A; Pichet Binette, A; Berron, D; Spotorno, N; van Westen, D; Stomrud, E; Mattsson-Carlgren, N; Strandberg, O; Smith, R; Palmqvist, S; Glenn, T; Moes, S; Honer, M; Arfanakis, K; Barnes, LL; Bennett, DA; Schneider, JA; Wisse, LEM; Hansson, O"
"Cognitive performance in healthy clinical trial participants and patients with the NeuroCart, a neurodegenerative disease measured with an automated neuropsychological and neurophysiological test battery.","The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases increases significantly with increasing age. Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of function of neurons that eventually leads to cell death, which in turn leads to cognitive disfunction. Cognitive performance can therefore also be considered age dependent. The current study investigated if the NeuroCart can detect age related decline on drug-sensitive CNS-tests in healthy volunteers (HV), and whether there are interactions between the rates of decline and sex. This study also investigated if the NeuroCart was able to differentiate disease profiles of neurodegenerative diseases, compared to age-matched HV and if there is age related decline in patient groups.",2023,Age related cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease; Cognition; Huntington's disease; Neurodegeneration; Parkinson's disease; Vascular dementia,"Humans; Male; Female; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Retrospective Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Huntington Disease; Dementia, Vascular; Cognition","Prins, S; Borghans, L; de Kam, ML; Groeneveld, GJ; van Gerven, J"
3d Virtual Histology Reveals Pathological Alterations of Cerebellar Granule Cells in Multiple Sclerosis.,"We investigate structural properties of neurons in the granular layer of human cerebellum with respect to their involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS). To this end we analyze data recorded by X-ray phase contrast tomography from tissue samples collected post mortem from a MS and a healthy control group. Using automated segmentation and histogram analysis based on optimal transport theory (OT) we find that the distributions representing nuclear structure in the granular layer move to a more compact nuclear state, i.e. smaller, denser and more heterogeneous nuclei in MS. We have previously made a similar observation for neurons of the dentate gyrus in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that more compact structure of neuronal nuclei which we attributed to increased levels of heterochromatin, may possibly represent a more general phenomenon of cellular senescence associated with neurodegeneration.",2023,X-ray phase contrast tomography; granule cells; multiple sclerosis; optimal transport,Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurons; Cerebellum; Cellular Senescence; Alzheimer Disease,"Frost, J; Schmitzer, B; Töpperwien, M; Eckermann, M; Franz, J; Stadelmann, C; Salditt, T"
Detection of Alzheimer's disease onset using MRI and PET neuroimaging: longitudinal data analysis and machine learning.,"The scientists are dedicated to studying the detection of Alzheimer's disease onset to find a cure, or at the very least, medication that can slow the progression of the disease.

The significance of feature extraction in highly complex neuroimaging data, identification of vulnerable brain regions, and the determination of the threshold values for plaques, tangles, and neurodegeneration of these regions will extensively be evaluated. Developing automated methods to improve the aforementioned research areas would enable specialists to determine the progression of the disease and find the link between the biomarkers and more accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease onset.",2023,deep learning; image processing; linear mixed effect model; neuroimaging; neuroimaging data sources; onset of Alzheimer’s disease detection; pattern recognition,,"Aberathne, I; Kulasiri, D; Samarasinghe, S"
Automatic and manual segmentation of the piriform cortex: Method development and validation in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease.,"The piriform cortex (PC) is located at the junction of the temporal and frontal lobes. It is involved physiologically in olfaction as well as memory and plays an important role in epilepsy. Its study at scale is held back by the absence of automatic segmentation methods on MRI. We devised a manual segmentation protocol for PC volumes, integrated those manually derived images into the Hammers Atlas Database (n = 30) and used an extensively validated method (multi-atlas propagation with enhanced registration, MAPER) for automatic PC segmentation. We applied automated PC volumetry to patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE; n = 174 including n = 58 controls) and to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI; n = 151, of whom with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 71; Alzheimer's disease (AD), n = 33; controls, n = 47).

Stereology neuron counts correlate with deep learning estimates in the human hippocampal subregions.,"Hippocampal subregions differ in specialization and vulnerability to cell death. Neuron death and hippocampal atrophy have been a marker for the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Relatively few studies have examined neuronal loss in the human brain using stereology. We characterize an automated high-throughput deep learning pipeline to segment hippocampal pyramidal neurons, generate pyramidal neuron estimates within the human hippocampal subfields, and relate our results to stereology neuron counts. Based on seven cases and 168 partitions, we vet deep learning parameters to segment hippocampal pyramidal neurons from the background using the open-source CellPose algorithm, and show the automated removal of false-positive segmentations. There was no difference in Dice scores between neurons segmented by the deep learning pipeline and manual segmentations (Independent Samples t-Test: t(28) = 0.33, p = 0.742). Deep-learning neuron estimates strongly correlate with manual stereological counts per subregion (Spearman's correlation (n = 9): r(7) = 0.97, p < 0.001), and for each partition individually (Spearman's correlation (n = 168): r(166) = 0.90, p <0 .001).

Attention-Guided Autoencoder for Automated Progression Prediction of Subjective Cognitive Decline With Structural MRI.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which happens even earlier than mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Progressive SCD will convert to MCI with the potential of further evolving to AD. Therefore, early identification of progressive SCD with neuroimaging techniques (e.g., structural MRI) is of great clinical value for early intervention of AD. However, existing MRI-based machine/deep learning methods usually suffer the small-sample-size problem and lack interpretability. To this end, we propose an interpretable autoencoder model with domain transfer learning (IADT) for progression prediction of SCD. Firstly, the proposed model can leverage MRIs from both the target domain (i.e., SCD) and auxiliary domains (e.g., AD and NC) for progressive SCD identification. Besides, it can automatically locate the disease-related brain regions of interest (defined in brain atlases) through an attention mechanism, which shows good interpretability. In addition, the IADT model is straightforward to train and test with only 5  ∼ 10 seconds on CPUs and is suitable for medical tasks with small datasets. Extensive experiments on the publicly available ADNI dataset and a private CLAS dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2023,,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Machine Learning; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression,"Guan, H; Yue, L; Yap, PT; Xiao, S; Bozoki, A; Liu, M"
Risk Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Conversion in Mild Cognitive Impaired Population Based on Brain Age Estimation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the world. To reduce the incidence of AD, it's essential to quantify the AD conversion risk of mild cognitive impaired (MCI) individuals. Here, we propose an AD conversion risk estimation system (CRES), which contains an automated MRI feature extractor, brain age estimation (BAE) module, and AD conversion risk estimation module. The CRES is trained on 634 normal controls (NC) from the public IXI and OASIS cohorts, then it is evaluated on 462 subjects (106 NC, 102 stable MCI (sMCI), 124 progressive MCI (pMCI) and 130 AD) from the ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that the MRI derived age gap (AG, chronological age subtracted from the estimated brain age) significantly distinguish NC, sMCI, pMCI and AD groups with p -value =0.000017 . Considering AG as the primary factor, incorporating gender and Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) for more robust Cox multi-variate hazard analysis, we concluded that each additional year in AG is associated with 4.57% greater AD conversion risk for the MCI group. Furthermore, a nomogram was drawn to describe MCI conversion risk at the individual level in the next 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and even 8 years from baseline. This work demonstrates that CRES can estimate AG based on MRI data, evaluate AD conversion risk of the MCI subjects, and identify the individuals with high AD conversion risk, which is valuable for effective intervention and diagnosis within an early period.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Cognition; Disease Progression,"Liu, W; Dong, Q; Sun, S; Shen, J; Qian, K; Hu, B"
"Artificial intelligence assisted identification of potential tau aggregation inhibitors: ligand- and structure-based virtual screening, in silico ADME, and molecular dynamics study.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe, growing, multifactorial disorder affecting millions of people worldwide characterized by cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. The accumulation of tau protein into paired helical filaments is one of the major pathological hallmarks of AD and has gained the interest of researchers as a potential drug target to treat AD. Lately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the drug discovery process by speeding it up and reducing the overall cost. As a part of our continuous effort to identify potential tau aggregation inhibitors, and leveraging the power of AI, in this study, we used a fully automated AI-assisted ligand-based virtual screening tool, PyRMD to screen a library of 12 million compounds from the ZINC database to identify potential tau aggregation inhibitors. The preliminary hits from virtual screening were filtered for similar compounds and pan-assay interference compounds (the compounds containing reactive functional groups which can interfere with the assays) using RDKit. Further, the selected compounds were prioritized based on their molecular docking score with the binding pocket of tau where the binding pockets were identified using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation. Thirty-three compounds showing good docking scores for all the tau clusters were selected and were further subjected to in silico pharmacokinetic prediction. Finally, top 10 compounds were selected for molecular dynamics simulation and MMPBSA binding free energy calculations resulting in the identification of UNK_175, UNK_1027, UNK_1172, UNK_1173, UNK_1237, UNK_1518, and UNK_2181 as potential tau aggregation inhibitors.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; MMPBSA; Molecular dynamics; PyRMD; Replica exchange molecular dynamics; Tau aggregation inhibitors,,"Das, B; Mathew, AT; Baidya, ATK; Devi, B; Salmon, RR; Kumar, R"
Reproducible Abnormalities and Diagnostic Generalizability of White Matter in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the impairment of white matter (WM) tracts. The current study aimed to verify the utility of WM as the neuroimaging marker of AD with multisite diffusion tensor imaging datasets [321 patients with AD, 265 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 279 normal controls (NC)], a unified pipeline, and independent site cross-validation. Automated fiber quantification was used to extract diffusion profiles along tracts. Random-effects meta-analyses showed a reproducible degeneration pattern in which fractional anisotropy significantly decreased in the AD and MCI groups compared with NC. Machine learning models using tract-based features showed good generalizability among independent site cross-validation. The diffusion metrics of the altered regions and the AD probability predicted by the models were highly correlated with cognitive ability in the AD and MCI groups.

Altered large-scale dynamic connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment patients: A machine learning study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegeneration disease associated with substantial disruptions in the brain network. However, most studies investigated static resting-state functional connections, while the alteration of dynamic functional connectivity in AD remains largely unknown. This study used group independent component analysis and the sliding-window method to estimate the subject-specific dynamic connectivity states in 1704 individuals from three data sets. Informative inherent states were identified by the multivariate pattern classification method, and classifiers were built to distinguish ADs from normal controls (NCs) and to classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with informative inherent states similar to ADs or not. In addition, MCI subgroups with heterogeneous functional states were examined in the context of different cognition decline trajectories. Five informative states were identified by feature selection, mainly involving functional connectivity belonging to the default mode network and working memory network. The classifiers discriminating AD and NC achieved the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 with leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Alterations in connectivity strength, fluctuation, and inter-synchronization were found in AD and MCIs. Moreover, individuals with MCI were clustered into two subgroups, which had different degrees of atrophy and different trajectories of cognition decline progression. The present study uncovered the alteration of dynamic functional connectivity in AD and highlighted that the dynamic states could be powerful features to discriminate patients from NCs. Furthermore, it demonstrated that these states help to identify MCIs with faster cognition decline and might contribute to the early prevention of AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; classification; dynamic connectivity; functional network,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Machine Learning,"Jing, R; Chen, P; Wei, Y; Si, J; Zhou, Y; Wang, D; Song, C; Yang, H; Zhang, Z; Yao, H; Kang, X; Fan, L; Han, T; Qin, W; Zhou, B; Jiang, T; Lu, J; Han, Y; Zhang, X; Liu, B; Yu, C; Wang, P; Liu, Y"

The Future of Cognitive Screening in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Cognitive screening instruments (CSI) have variable sensitivity and specificity to the cognitive changes associated with dementia syndromes, and the most recent systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the benefit of cognitive screening tools in older adults residing within the community. Consequently, there is a critical need to improve CSI methods, which have not yet incorporated advances in psychometrics, neuroscience, and technology. The primary goal of this article is to provide a framework for transitioning from legacy CSIs to advanced dementia screening measurement. In line with ongoing efforts in neuropsychology and the call for next-generation digital assessment for early detection of AD, we propose a psychometrically advanced (including application of item response theory methods), automated selective assessment model that provides a framework to help propel an assessment revolution. Further, we present a three-phase model for modernizing CSIs and discuss critical diversity and inclusion issues, current challenges in differentiating normal from pathological aging, and ethical considerations.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cognitivescreening instruments; dementia; neuropsychology,Humans; Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Aging; Psychometrics; Dementia; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease,"Umfleet, LG; Bilder, RM; Loring, DW; Thames, A; Hampstead, BM; Bauer, RM; Drane, DL; Cavanagh, L"

Screening over Speech in Unselected Populations for Clinical Trials in AD (PROSPECT-AD): Study Design and Protocol.,"Speech impairments are an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and consequently, analysing speech performance is a promising new digital biomarker for AD screening. Future clinical AD trials on disease modifying drugs will require a shift to very early identification of individuals at risk of dementia.

Brainstem atrophy in dementia with Lewy bodies compared with progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease on MRI.,"Although Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common form of dementia in elderly patients, it remains underdiagnosed compared with Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD). This may be explained by overlapping clinical symptoms, e.g. Parkinsonism.

Automatic segmentation of the choroid plexuses: Method and validation in controls and patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Choroid Plexuses (ChP) are structures located in the ventricles that produce the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central nervous system. They are also a key component of the blood-CSF barrier. Recent studies have described clinically relevant ChP volumetric changes in several neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, a reliable and automated tool for ChP segmentation on images derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial need for large studies attempting to elucidate their role in neurological disorders. Here, we propose a novel automatic method for ChP segmentation in large imaging datasets. The approach is based on a 2-step 3D U-Net to keep preprocessing steps to a minimum for ease of use and to lower memory requirements. The models are trained and validated on a first research cohort including people with MS and healthy subjects. A second validation is also performed on a cohort of pre-symptomatic MS patients having acquired MRIs in routine clinical practice. Our method reaches an average Dice coefficient of 0.72 ± 0.01 with the ground truth and a volume correlation of 0.86 on the first cohort while outperforming FreeSurfer and FastSurfer-based ChP segmentations. On the dataset originating from clinical practice, the method reaches a Dice coefficient of 0.67 ± 0.01 (being close to the inter-rater agreement of 0.64 ± 0.02) and a volume correlation of 0.84. These results demonstrate that this is a suitable and robust method for the segmentation of the ChP both on research and clinical datasets.",2023,Choroid plexus; Deep learning; Multiple sclerosis; Radiologically isolated syndrome; Segmentation,"Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Parkinson Disease; Choroid; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Yazdan-Panah, A; Schmidt-Mengin, M; Ricigliano, VAG; Soulier, T; Stankoff, B; Colliot, O"
Varied performance of picture description task as a screening tool across MCI subtypes.,"A picture description task is a component of Miro Health's platform for self-administration of neurobehavioral assessments. Picture description has been used as a screening tool for identification of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but currently requires in-person administration and scoring by someone with access to and familiarity with a scoring rubric. The Miro Health implementation allows broader use of this assessment through self-administration and automated processing, analysis, and scoring to deliver clinically useful quantifications of the users' speech production, vocal characteristics, and language. Picture description responses were collected from 62 healthy controls (HC), and 33 participants with MCI: 18 with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 15 with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). Speech and language features and contrasts between pairs of features were evaluated for differences in their distributions in the participant subgroups. Picture description features were selected and combined using penalized logistic regression to form risk scores for classification of HC versus MCI as well as HC versus specific MCI subtypes. A picture-description based risk score distinguishes MCI and HC with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.74. When contrasting specific subtypes of MCI and HC, the classifiers have an AUROC of 0.88 for aMCI versus HC and and AUROC of 0.61 for naMCI versus HC. Tests of association of individual features or contrasts of pairs of features with HC versus aMCI identified 20 features with p-values below 5e-3 and False Discovery Rates (FDRs) at or below 0.113, and 61 contrasts with p-values below 5e-4 and FDRs at or below 0.132. Findings suggest that performance of picture description as a screening tool for MCI detection will vary greatly by MCI subtype or by the proportion of various subtypes in an undifferentiated MCI population.",2023,,,"Mefford, JA; Zhao, Z; Heilier, L; Xu, M; Zhou, G; Mace, R; Sloane, KL; Sheppard, SM; Glenn, S"

Detecting the effect of genetic diversity on brain composition in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurodegeneration, pathology accumulation, and progressive cognitive decline. There is significant variation in age at onset and severity of symptoms highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in the study of AD. To address this, we analyzed cell and pathology composition of 6- and 14-month-old AD-BXD mouse brains using the semi-automated workflow (QUINT); which we expanded to allow for nonlinear refinement of brain atlas-registration, and quality control assessment of atlas-registration and brain section integrity. Near global age-related increases in microglia, astrocyte, and amyloid-beta accumulation were measured, while regional variation in neuron load existed among strains. Furthermore, hippocampal immunohistochemistry analyses were combined with bulk RNA-sequencing results to demonstrate the relationship between cell composition and gene expression. Overall, the additional functionality of the QUINT workflow delivers a highly effective method for registering and quantifying cell and pathology changes in diverse disease models.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cell composition; deconvolution; genetic diversity; immunohistochemistry; mouse brain; neurodegeneration; reference atlas,,"Gurdon, B; Yates, SC; Csucs, G; Groeneboom, NE; Hadad, N; Telpoukhovskaia, M; Ouellette, A; Ouellette, T; O'Connell, K; Singh, S; Murdy, T; Merchant, E; Bjerke, I; Kleven, H; Schlegel, U; Leergaard, TB; Puchades, MA; Bjaalie, JG; Kaczorowski, CC"

Learnings about Aβ from human brain recommend the use of a live-neuron bioassay for the discovery of next generation Alzheimer's disease immunotherapeutics.,"Despite ongoing debate, the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) remains the prime therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, rational drug design has been hampered by a lack of knowledge about neuroactive Aβ. To help address this deficit, we developed live-cell imaging of iPSC-derived human neurons (iNs) to study the effects of the most disease relevant form of Aβ-oligomeric assemblies (oAβ) extracted from AD brain. Of ten brains studied, extracts from nine caused neuritotoxicity, and in eight cases this was abrogated by Aβ immunodepletion. Here we show that activity in this bioassay agrees relatively well with disruption of hippocampal long-term potentiation, a correlate of learning and memory, and that measurement of neurotoxic oAβ can be obscured by more abundant non-toxic forms of Aβ. These findings indicate that the development of novel Aβ targeting therapeutics may benefit from unbiased activity-based discovery. To test this principle, we directly compared 5 clinical antibodies (aducanumab, bapineuzumab,  BAN2401, gantenerumab, and SAR228810) together with an in-house aggregate-preferring antibody (1C22) and established relative EC",2023,Amyloid β-protein; Automated live-cell imaging; Immunotherapy; Long-term potentiation; Monoclonal antibodies; Neuritic dystrophy; Soluble aggregates,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Immunotherapy; Neurons,"Wang, Z; Jin, M; Hong, W; Liu, W; Reczek, D; Lagomarsino, VN; Hu, Y; Weeden, T; Frosch, MP; Young-Pearse, TL; Pradier, L; Selkoe, D; Walsh, DM"
Task-Evoked Pupillary Response as a Potential Biomarker of Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Scoping Review.,"Pupil dilation functions as a proxy for cognitive effort and can be measured through automated pupillometry. The aim of this scoping review is to examine how individuals with cognitive impairment differ in task-evoked pupillary responses relative to cognitively healthy individuals. A systematic literature search across six databases was conducted to identify studies examining changes in pupillary responses evoked by cognitive tasks comparing patients with dementia to healthy controls. Eight articles met inclusion criteria and were included for review. Differences in task-evoked pupillary response between cognitively impaired and cognitively healthy participants were observed across studies. Pupil dilation is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's Disease compared to controls, with no difference observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment. A mild, non-significant trend towards reduced pupil dilation in patients with either Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies suggests a similar but less pronounced effect than in AD patients. Further research is required to examine the utility of task-evoked pupillary responses as a potential biomarker indexing cognitive decline in individuals transitioning to mild cognitive impairment and/or dementia.",2023,biomarker; cognitive task; dementia; early detection; pupillometry,Humans; Pupil; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Biomarkers,"Zeeman, M; Figeys, M; Brimmo, T; Burnstad, C; Hao, J; Kim, ES"
Alzheimer' disease prediction and classification using CT images through machine learning.,"Numerous surveys using different techniques have been conducted in recent years to accurately classify Alzheimer's disease (AD). This research emphasized the identification of AD through neuroimaging data. However, it is important to identify symptoms as soon as possible when the disease-modifying medications function best during infection before a permanent cognitive impairment develops. The use of automated algorithms to detect the early symptom of AD to this information was very important. Machine Learning (ML) has been proposed for the evaluation of various image segmentation and database techniques. In addition, Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16 et Improved Faster Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (IFRCNN) method developed for the ImageNet database utilizing the mathematical model based on action recognition as a feature extractor for categorization work.

Multiplexing allows proteome differences across multiple samples to be measured simultaneously, resulting in more accurate quantitation, increased statistical robustness, reduced analysis times, and lower experimental costs. The number of samples that can be multiplexed has evolved from as few as two to more than 50, with studies involving more than 10 samples being denoted as enhanced multiplexing or hyperplexing. In this review, we give an update on emerging multiplexing proteomics techniques and highlight advantages and limitations for enhanced multiplexing strategies.",2023,automation; high-throughput; hyperplexing; multiplexing; proteomics,Proteomics; Biological Assay; Biomedical Enhancement; Mass Spectrometry; Proteome,"Bowser, BL; Robinson, RAS"

Using CNN Saliency Maps and EEG Modulation Spectra for Improved and More Interpretable Machine Learning-Based Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Biomarkers based on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals have emerged as a promising tool in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, a state-of-the-art biomarker was found based on visual inspection of power modulation spectrograms where three ""patches"" or regions from the modulation spectrogram were proposed and used for AD diagnostics. Here, we propose the use of deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with saliency maps, trained on power modulation spectrogram inputs to find optimal patches in a data-driven manner. Experiments are conducted on EEG data collected from fifty-four participants, including 20 healthy controls, 19 patients with mild AD, and 15 moderate-to-severe AD patients. Five classification tasks are explored, including the three-class problem, early-stage detection (control vs. mild-AD), and severity level detection (mild vs. moderate-to-severe). Experimental results show the proposed biomarkers outperform the state-of-the-art benchmark across all five tasks, as well as finding complementary modulation spectrogram regions not previously seen via visual inspection. Lastly, experiments are conducted on the proposed biomarkers to test their sensitivity to age, as this is a known confound in AD characterization. Across all five tasks, none of the proposed biomarkers showed a significant relationship with age, thus further highlighting their usefulness for automated AD diagnostics.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Electroencephalography","Lopes, M; Cassani, R; Falk, TH"
Conventional machine learning and deep learning in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using neuroimaging: A review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes memory degradation and cognitive function impairment in elderly people. The irreversible and devastating cognitive decline brings large burdens on patients and society. So far, there is no effective treatment that can cure AD, but the process of early-stage AD can slow down. Early and accurate detection is critical for treatment. In recent years, deep-learning-based approaches have achieved great success in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. The main objective of this paper is to review some popular conventional machine learning methods used for the classification and prediction of AD using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The methods reviewed in this paper include support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), autoencoder, deep learning, and transformer. This paper also reviews pervasively used feature extractors and different types of input forms of convolutional neural network. At last, this review discusses challenges such as class imbalance and data leakage.

Supporting the Detection of Early Alzheimer's Disease with a Four-Channel EEG Analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. Although there is no current cure, medical treatment can help to control its progression. Hence, early-stage diagnosis is crucial to maximize the living standards of the patients. Biochemical markers and medical imaging in combination with neuropsychological tests represent the most extended diagnosis procedure. However, these techniques require specialized personnel and long processing time. Furthermore, the access to some of these techniques is often limited in crowded healthcare systems and rural areas. In this context, electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique to obtain endogenous brain information, has been proposed for the diagnosis of early-stage AD. Despite the valuable information provided by clinical EEG and high density montages, these approaches are impractical in conditions such as those described above. Consequently, in this study, we evaluated the feasibly of using a reduced EEG montage with only four channels to detect early-stage AD. For this purpose, we involved eight clinically diagnosed AD patients and eight healthy controls. The results we obtained reveal similar accuracies ([Formula: see text]-value[Formula: see text]0.66) for the reduced montage (0.86) and a 16-channel montage (0.87). This suggests that a four-channel wearable EEG system could be an effective tool for supporting early-stage AD detection.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; artificial intelligence; automated detection; reduced EEG montage; wearable EEG,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Electroencephalography; Brain; Brain Mapping,"Perez-Valero, E; Morillas, C; Lopez-Gordo, MA; Minguillon, J"

Distinct spatiotemporal subtypes of amyloid deposition are associated with diverging disease profiles in cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment individuals.,"We aimed to investigate the relationship between spatiotemporal changes of amyloid deposition and Alzheimer's disease (AD) profiles in cognitively normal (CN) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using a data-driven method and amyloid-PET data, we identified and validated two subtypes in two independent datasets (discovery dataset: N = 548, age = 72.4 ± 6.78, 49% female; validation dataset: N = 348, age = 74.9 ± 8.16, 47% female) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative across a range of individuals who were CN or had MCI. The two subtypes showed distinct regional progression patterns and presented distinct genetic, clinical and biomarker characteristics. The cortex-priority subtype was more likely to show typical clinical syndromes of symptomatic AD and vice versa.

Preanalytic variable effects on segmentation and quantification machine learning algorithms for amyloid-β analyses on digitized human brain slides.,"Computational machine learning (ML)-based frameworks could be advantageous for scalable analyses in neuropathology. A recent deep learning (DL) framework has shown promise in automating the processes of visualizing and quantifying different types of amyloid-β deposits as well as segmenting white matter (WM) from gray matter (GM) on digitized immunohistochemically stained slides. However, this framework has only been trained and evaluated on amyloid-β-stained slides with minimal changes in preanalytic variables. In this study, we evaluated select preanalytical variables including magnification, compression rate, and storage format using three digital slides scanners (Zeiss Axioscan Z1, Leica Aperio AT2, and Leica Aperio GT 450), on over 60 whole slide images, in a cohort of 14 cases having a spectrum of amyloid-β deposits.

Identification of Alzheimer's Disease by Imaging: A Comprehensive Review.,"In developing countries, there is more concern for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by public health professionals due to its catastrophic effects on the elderly. Early detection of this disease helps in starting the therapy soon and slows down the progression of the disease. Imaging techniques are considered to be the best solutions for its detection. Brain imaging was initially used to diagnose AD. Different techniques for identifying protein accumulation in the nervous system, a sign of Alzheimer's disease, are identified by MRI imaging. Although they were initially attributed to cortical dysfunction, visual system impairments in Alzheimer's patients were also found in the early 1970s. Several non-invasive approaches reported for screening, prevention, and therapy were unsuccessful. It is vitally necessary to develop new diagnostic methods in order to accurately identify patients who are in the early stages of this disease. It would be wonderful to have a quick, non-invasive, affordable, and easily scalable Alzheimer's disease screening. Researchers may be able to identify biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and understand more about its aetiology with imaging and data processing. This study clarifies the need for medical image processing and analysis strategies which aid in the non-invasive diagnosis of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; image reconstruction; image registration; image segmentation; medical imaging; non-invasive method,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain,"T, P; V, S"
Conjunctival microcirculation in ocular and systemic microvascular disease.,"The conjunctival microcirculation is an accessible complex network of micro vessels whose quantitative assessment can reveal microvascular haemodynamic properties. Currently, algorithms for the measurement of conjunctival haemodynamics use either manual or semi-automated systems, which may provide insight into overall conjunctival health, as well as in ocular and systemic disease. These algorithms include functional slit-lamp biomicroscopy, laser doppler flowmetry, optical coherence tomography angiography, orthogonal polarized spectral imaging, computer-assisted intravitral microscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and corneal confocal microscopy. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated a relationship between conjunctival microcirculatory haemodynamics and many diseases such as dry eye disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, hypertension, sepsis, coronary microvascular disease, and sickle cell anaemia.

Automated hemodynamic assessment for cranial 4D flow MRI.,"Cranial 4D flow MRI post-processing typically involves manual user interaction which is time-consuming and associated with poor repeatability. The primary goal of this study is to develop a robust quantitative velocity tool (QVT) that utilizes threshold-based segmentation techniques to improve segmentation quality over prior approaches based on centerline processing schemes (CPS) that utilize k-means clustering segmentation. This tool also includes an interactive 3D display designed for simplified vessel selection and automated hemodynamic visualization and quantification. The performances of QVT and CPS were compared in vitro in a flow phantom and in vivo in 10 healthy participants. Vessel segmentations were compared with ground-truth computed tomography in vitro (29 locations) and manual segmentation in vivo (13 locations) using linear regression. Additionally, QVT and CPS MRI flow rates were compared to perivascular ultrasound flow in vitro using linear regression. To assess internal consistency of flow measures in vivo, conservation of flow was assessed at vessel junctions using linear regression and consistency of flow along vessel segments was analyzed by fitting a Gaussian distribution to a histogram of normalized flow values. Post-processing times were compared between the QVT and CPS using paired t-tests. Vessel areas segmented in vitro (CPS: slope = 0.71, r = 0.95 and QVT: slope = 1.03, r = 0.95) and in vivo (CPS: slope = 0.61, r = 0.96 and QVT: slope = 0.93, r = 0.96) were strongly correlated with ground-truth area measurements. However, CPS (using k-means segmentation) consistently underestimated vessel areas. Strong correlations were observed between QVT and ultrasound flow (slope = 0.98, r = 0.96) as well as flow at junctions (slope = 1.05, r = 0.98). Mean and standard deviation of flow along vessel segments was 9.33e-16 ± 3.05%. Additionally, the QVT demonstrated excellent interobserver agreement and significantly reduced post-processing by nearly 10 min (p < 0.001). By completely automating post-processing and providing an easy-to-use 3D visualization interface for interactive vessel selection and hemodynamic quantification, the QVT offers an efficient, robust, and repeatable means to analyze cranial 4D flow MRI.

Deep Learning for Brain MRI Confirms Patterned Pathological Progression in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Deep learning (DL) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has shown excellent performance in differentiating individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the value of DL in detecting progressive structural MRI (sMRI) abnormalities linked to AD pathology has yet to be established. In this study, an interpretable DL algorithm named the Ensemble of 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (Ensemble 3DCNN) with enhanced parsing techniques is proposed to investigate the longitudinal trajectories of whole-brain sMRI changes denoting AD onset and progression. A set of 2369 T1-weighted images from the multi-centre Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies cohorts are applied to model derivation, validation, testing, and pattern analysis. An Ensemble-3DCNN-based P-score is generated, based on which multiple brain regions, including amygdala, insular, parahippocampal, and temporal gyrus, exhibit early and connected progressive neurodegeneration. Complex individual variability in the sMRI is also observed. This study combining non-invasive sMRI and interpretable DL in detecting patterned sMRI changes confirmed AD pathological progression, shedding new light on predicting AD progression using whole-brain sMRI.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; deep learning; longitudinal trajectories of neurodegeneration; structural magnetic resonance imaging,Humans; Deep Learning; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain,"Pan, D; Zeng, A; Yang, B; Lai, G; Hu, B; Song, X; Jiang, T"
Classification of mild cognitive impairment based on handwriting dynamics and qEEG.,"Subtle changes in fine motor control and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are important in screening for early dementia in primary care populations. In this study, an automated, non-invasive and rapid detection protocol for mild cognitive impairment based on handwriting kinetics and quantitative EEG analysis was proposed, and a classification model based on a dual fusion of feature and decision layers was designed for clinical decision-marking. Seventy-nine volunteers (39 healthy elderly controls and 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment) were recruited for this study, and the handwritten data and the EEG signals were performed using a tablet and MUSE under four designed handwriting tasks. Sixty-eight features were extracted from the EEG and handwriting parameters of each test. Features selected from both models were fused using a late feature fusion strategy with a weighted voting strategy for decision making, and classification accuracy was compared using three different classifiers under handwritten features, EEG features and fused features respectively. The results show that the dual fusion model can further improve the classification accuracy, with the highest classification accuracy for the combined features and the best classification result of 96.3% using SVM with RBF kernel as the base classifier. In addition, this not only supports the greater significance of multimodal data for differentiating MCI, but also tests the feasibility of using the portable EEG headband as a measure of EEG in patients with cognitive impairment.",2023,Classification; Electroencephalography; Ensemble learning; Handwriting analysis; Mild cognitive impairment; Quantitative; Wearable sensors,Humans; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Electroencephalography; Handwriting; Alzheimer Disease,"Chai, J; Wu, R; Li, A; Xue, C; Qiang, Y; Zhao, J; Zhao, Q; Yang, Q"

Data Analytics in Healthcare: A Tertiary Study.,"The field of healthcare has seen a rapid increase in the applications of data analytics during the last decades. By utilizing different data analytic solutions, healthcare areas such as medical image analysis, disease recognition, outbreak monitoring, and clinical decision support have been automated to various degrees. Consequently, the intersection of healthcare and data analytics has received scientific attention to the point of numerous secondary studies. We analyze studies on healthcare data analytics, and provide a wide overview of the subject. This is a tertiary study, i.e., a systematic review of systematic reviews. We identified 45 systematic secondary studies on data analytics applications in different healthcare sectors, including diagnosis and disease profiling, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and sepsis. Machine learning and data mining were the most widely used data analytics techniques in healthcare applications, with a rising trend in popularity. Healthcare data analytics studies often utilize four popular databases in their primary study search, typically select 25-100 primary studies, and the use of research guidelines such as PRISMA is growing. The results may help both data analytics and healthcare researchers towards relevant and timely literature reviews and systematic mappings, and consequently, towards respective empirical studies. In addition, the meta-analysis presents a high-level perspective on prominent data analytics applications in healthcare, indicating the most popular topics in the intersection of data analytics and healthcare, and provides a big picture on a topic that has seen dozens of secondary studies in the last 2 decades.",2023,Artificial intelligence; Data analytics; Data mining; Healthcare; Machine learning; Review,,"Taipalus, T; Isomöttönen, V; Erkkilä, H; Äyrämö, S"
Discriminative patterns of white matter changes in Alzheimer's.,"Changes in structural connectivity of the Alzheimer's brain have not been widely studied utilizing cutting-edge methodologies. This study develops an efficient structural connectome-based convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the AD and uses explanations of CNNs' choices in classification to pinpoint the discriminative changes in white matter connectivity in AD. A CNN architecture has been developed to classify normal control (NC) and AD subjects from the weighted structural connectome. Then, the CNN classification decision is visually analyzed using gradient-based localization techniques to identify the discriminative changes in white matter connectivity in Alzheimer's. The cortical regions involved in the identified discriminative structural connectivity changes in AD are highly covered in the temporal/subcortical regions. A specific pattern is identified in the discriminative changes in structural connectivity of AD, where the white matter changes are revealed within the temporal/subcortical regions and from the temporal/subcortical regions to the frontal and parietal regions in both left and right hemispheres.  The proposed approach has the potential to comprehensively analyze the discriminative structural connectivity differences in AD, change the way of detecting biomarkers, and help clinicians better understand the structural changes in AD and provide them with more confidence in automated diagnostic systems.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; CNN; Class activation map; Structural brain network; White matter connectivity,Humans; White Matter; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Connectome; Biomarkers,"Srivishagan, S; Kumaralingam, L; Thanikasalam, K; Pinidiyaarachchi, UAJ; Ratnarajah, N"
How far is the goal of applying β-amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with standardization of measurements?,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid (Aβ) is important for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the cohort distributions and cut-off values have large variation across different analytical assays, kits, and laboratories. In this review, we summarize the cut-off values and diagnostic performance for CSF Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, and explore the important effect factors. Based on the Alzheimer's Association external quality control program (AAQC program), the peer group coefficient of variation of manual ELISA assays for CSF Aβ1-42 was unsatisfied (>20%). Fully automated platforms with better performance have recently been developed, but still not widely applied. In 2020, the certified reference material (CRM) for CSF Aβ1-42 was launched; however, the AAQC 2021-round results did not show effective improvements. Thus, further development and popularization of CRM for CSF Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 are urgently required. Standardizing the diagnostic procedures of AD and related status and the pre-analytical protocols of CSF samples, improving detection performance of analytical assays, and popularizing the application of fully automated platforms are also important for the establishment of uniform cut-off values. Moreover, each laboratory should verify the applicability of uniform cut-off values, and evaluate whether it is necessary to establish its own population- and assay-specific cut-off values.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Cut-off value; β-amyloid,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments; Reference Standards; tau Proteins,"Zou, Y; Yu, S; Ma, X; Ma, C; Mao, C; Mu, D; Li, L; Gao, J; Qiu, L"
Spatially informed Bayesian neural network for neurodegenerative diseases classification.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. One field of extensive clinical use of MRI is the accurate and automated classification of degenerative disorders. Most of current classification studies either do not mirror medical practice where patients may exhibit early stages of the disease, comorbidities, or atypical variants, or they are not able to produce probabilistic predictions nor account for uncertainty. Also, the spatial heterogeneity of the brain alterations caused by neurodegenerative processes is not usually considered, despite the spatial configuration of the neuronal loss is a characteristic hallmark for each disorder. In this article, we propose a classification technique that incorporates uncertainty and spatial information for distinguishing between healthy subjects and patients from four distinct neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. We introduce a spatially informed Bayesian neural network (SBNN) that combines a three-dimensional neural network to extract neurodegeneration features from MRI, Bayesian inference to account for uncertainty in diagnosis, and a spatially informed MRI image using hidden Markov random fields to encode cerebral spatial information. The SBNN model demonstrates that classification accuracy increases up to 25% by including a spatially informed MRI scan. Furthermore, the SBNN provides a robust probabilistic diagnosis that resembles clinical decision-making and can account for the heterogeneous medical presentations of neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,Bayesian inference; classification; deep learning; magnetic resonance imaging; neurodegenerative diseases; spatial information,"Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Bayes Theorem; Neural Networks, Computer; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease","Payares-Garcia, D; Mateu, J; Schick, W"

Information Contained in EEG Allows Characterization of Cognitive Decline in Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Over the last few decades, electroencephalography (EEG) has evolved from being a method that purely relies on visual inspection into a quantitative method. Quantitative EEG, or QEEG, enables the assessment of neurological disorders based on spectral features, dynamic characterizations of EEG resting-state activity, brain connectivity analyzes or quantification of EEG signal complexity. The information contained in EEG is multidimensional: Electrodes, positioned at different scalp locations, provide a spatial dimension to the analysis of EEG while time provides a dynamic dimension: This multidimensional property of EEG makes its quantification a challenging task. In this narrative review we present quantitative models focused on different aspects of EEG: While microstate models focus more on the quantification of the dynamic aspects of EEG, spectral methods, connectivity analysis and entropy based models are more concerned with its spatial aspects. Nevertheless, these diverse approaches have provided neurophysiology based biomarkers, especially for monitoring and predicting the course of various neurodegenerative disorders. However, their translation into clinical practice crucially depends on the ability to automate the analysis of EEG in a user-friendly manner, without compromising on the validity of the provided results. Once this has been accomplished, EEG would provide an inexpensive and widely available method for monitoring disease progression, identifying patients at risk of neurodegeneration-especially before the onset of clinical symptoms, and predicting future cognition. For stratification of patients to clinical trials, EEG would allow shortening the trial duration and lowering the number of necessary participants by identifying patients at risk of fast cognitive decline.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; EEG; Parkinson’s disease; neurodegeneration; neurophysiological biomarker,Humans; Electroencephalography; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain Mapping,"Keller, SM; Reyneke, C; Gschwandtner, U; Fuhr, P"

MS-based glycomics and glycoproteomics methods enabling isomeric characterization.,"Glycosylation is one of the most significant and abundant posttranslational modifications in mammalian cells. It mediates a wide range of biofunctions, including cell adhesion, cell communication, immune cell trafficking, and protein stability. Also, aberrant glycosylation has been associated with various diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, inflammation, immune deficiencies, congenital disorders, and cancers. The alterations in the distributions of glycan and glycopeptide isomers are involved in the development and progression of several human diseases. However, the microheterogeneity of glycosylation brings a great challenge to glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis, including the characterization of isomers. Over several decades, different methods and approaches have been developed to facilitate the characterization of glycan and glycopeptide isomers. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been a powerful tool utilized for glycomic and glycoproteomic isomeric analysis due to its high sensitivity and rich structural information using different fragmentation techniques. However, a comprehensive characterization of glycan and glycopeptide isomers remains a challenge when utilizing MS alone. Therefore, various separation methods, including liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and ion mobility, were developed to resolve glycan and glycopeptide isomers before MS. These separation techniques were coupled to MS for a better identification and quantitation of glycan and glycopeptide isomers. Additionally, bioinformatic tools are essential for the automated processing of glycan and glycopeptide isomeric data to facilitate isomeric studies in biological cohorts. Here in this review, we discuss commonly employed MS-based techniques, separation hyphenated MS methods, and software, facilitating the separation, identification, and quantitation of glycan and glycopeptide isomers.",2023,MS-based isomeric characterization; glycan isomers; glycopeptide isomers,Animals; Humans; Glycomics; Mass Spectrometry; Software; Polysaccharides; Glycopeptides; Mammals,"Peng, W; Gutierrez Reyes, CD; Gautam, S; Yu, A; Cho, BG; Goli, M; Donohoo, K; Mondello, S; Kobeissy, F; Mechref, Y"
