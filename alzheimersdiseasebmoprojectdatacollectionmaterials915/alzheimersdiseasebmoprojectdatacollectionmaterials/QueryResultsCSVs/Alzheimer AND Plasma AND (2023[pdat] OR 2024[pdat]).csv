Genetic evidence for serum amyloid P component as a drug target in neurodegenerative disorders.,"The mechanisms responsible for neuronal death causing cognitive loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other dementias are not known. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a constitutive plasma protein, which is cytotoxic for cerebral neurones and also promotes formation and persistence of cerebral A",2024,Alzheimer's disease; C-reactive protein‌; Lewy body dementia; genome-wide association study; miridesap; serum amyloid P component,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Serum Amyloid P-Component; Alzheimer Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Lewy Body Disease; Male; Female","Schmidt, AF; Finan, C; Chopade, S; Ellmerich, S; Rossor, MN; Hingorani, AD; Pepys, MB"
"Dysregulation of Lipid Metabolism Serves as A Link Between Alzheimer's and Cardiovascular Disease, As Witnessed in A Cross-Sectional Study.","Cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) increase the risk of suffering dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Here, we set out to define specific molecular profiles of CVD in patients with DAT to better understand its relationship, to unravel the mechanisms underlying the high risk of developing DAT in CVD patients and to define new markers of early disease. Plasma samples from patients with DAT, with and without CVD, were analyzed through a multiomics approach, with integration of metabolomics and proteomics datasets using the OmicsNet web-based tool. Metabolomics results showed an enrichment in lipids and lipid-like molecules. Similarly, the most significant cluster identified through proteomics was formed by 5 proteins related to lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism. After integration and functional enrichment, glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation and sphingolipid metabolism were among the most significant functions. Finally, differential expression of ABCA1 and APOH proteins was verified, in an independent cohort also including controls and patients with CVD alone. Both proteins positively correlated with phospho-Tau (181), a classical hallmark of DAT. Different molecular profiles exist in patients with DAT, with and without CVD, with exacerbated alterations in patients in which DAT and CVD co-exist. This information may help to define biomarkers like ABCA1 and APOH that identify patients with cardiovascular dysfunction that are at high risk of developing DAT. Such markers will allow more personalized interventions to be selected, a further step towards precision medicine for individuals whose molecular profiles indicate a distinct response to the same management strategies.",2024,,,"Mourino-Alvarez, L; Juarez-Alia, C; Sastre-Oliva, T; Perales-Sánchez, I; Hernandez-Fernandez, G; Chicano-Galvez, E; Peralbo-Molina, Á; Madruga, F; Blanco-Lopez, E; Tejerina, T; Barderas, MG"
Brain targeting efficacy of novel drug delivery system in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common degenerative disease of the central nervous system in the elderly, has become the third largest health killer after cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and tumors. Based on the fact that Alzheimer's disease is a disease with multiple etiologies and complex pathology, a single target is bound to have a limited curative effect, and the synergy of multiple links and multiple targets is expected to achieve a better curative effect. The aim of this study is to investigate the brain targeting of a drug modified by chitosan, based on the new nanodrug delivery system for treating Alzheimer's disease developed by the research group.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Chitosan; Administration, Intranasal; Brain; Drug Delivery Systems; Animals; Galantamine; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Humans; Rats; Male; Nanoparticle Drug Delivery System","Duan, LH; Li, LI; Wang, CB; Liu, QQ; Zhang, X; Wu, ZZ"
Prospects and challenges in using neuronal extracellular vesicles in biomarker research.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promise as a source of disease biomarkers. The diverse molecular cargo of EVs can potentially indicate the status of their tissue of origin, even against the complex background of whole plasma. The main tools currently available for assessing biomarkers of brain health include brain imaging and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Given the costs and difficulties associated with these methods, isolation of EVs of neuronal origin (NEVs) from the blood is an attractive approach to identify brain-specific biomarkers. This perspective describes current key challenges in EV- and NEV-based biomarker research. These include the relative low abundance of EVs, the lack of validated isolation methods, and the difficult search for an adequate target for immunocapturing NEVs. We discuss that these challenges must be addressed before NEVs can fulfill their potential for biomarker research. HIGHLIGHTS: NEVs are promising sources of biomarkers for brain disorders. Immunocapturing NEVs from complex biofluids presents several challenges. The choice of surface target for capture will determine NEV yield. Contamination by non-EV sources is relevant for biomarkers at low concentrations.",2024,biomarkers; central nervous system; neurodegenerative disorders; neuronal‐enriched extracellular vesicles,,"Rocha, DAS; Santos, LE; Da Fonseca, PB; De Felice, FG"
"Systemic inflammatory markers in ageing, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.","Systemic inflammation with alterations in inflammatory markers is involved in aging and Alzheimer's disease. However, few studies have investigated the longitudinal trajectories of systemic inflammatory markers during aging and Alzheimer's disease, and specific markers contributing to Alzheimer's disease remain undetermined. In this study, a longitudinal cohort (cohort 1: n = 290; controls, 136; preclinical Alzheimer's disease, 154) and a cross-sectional cohort (cohort 2: n = 351; controls, 62; Alzheimer's disease, 63; vascular dementia, 58; Parkinson's disease dementia, 56; behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 57; dementia with Lewy bodies, 55) were included. Plasma levels of inflammatory markers were measured every 2 years during a 10-year follow-up in the longitudinal cohort and once in the cross-sectional cohort. The study demonstrated that the inflammatory markers significantly altered during both aging and the development of Alzheimer's disease. However, only complement C3, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 exhibited significant changes in participants with preclinical Alzheimer's disease, and their longitudinal changes were significantly associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease compared to controls over the 10-year follow-up. In the cross-sectional cohort, complement C3 demonstrates specificity to Alzheimer's disease, while interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 were also altered in other dementias. The study provides a new perspective on the involvement of inflammatory markers in the aging process and the development of Alzheimer's disease, implying that regulating inflammation may have a pivotal role in promoting successful aging and in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; aging; complement; interleukin; longitudinal; systemic inflammation,,"Cai, H; Zhao, T; Pang, Y; Fu, X; Ren, Z; Quan, S; Jia, L"
DAP12 interacts with RER1 and is retained in the secretory pathway before assembly with TREM2.,"DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) is a transmembrane adapter protein expressed in lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells. It interacts with several immunoreceptors forming functional complexes that trigger intracellular signaling pathways. One of the DAP12 associated receptors is the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). Mutations in both DAP12 and TREM2 have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, mechanisms involved in the regulation of subcellular trafficking and turnover of these proteins are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that proteasomal degradation of DAP12 is increased in the absence of TREM2. Interestingly, unassembled DAP12 is also retained in early secretory compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), thereby preventing its transport to the plasma membrane. We also show that unassembled DAP12 interacts with the retention in ER sorting receptor 1 (RER1). The deletion of endogenous RER1 decreases expression of functional TREM2-DAP12 complexes and membrane proximal signaling, and resulted in almost complete inhibition of phagocytic activity in THP-1 differentiated macrophage-like cells. These results indicate that RER1 acts as an important regulator of DAP12 containing immunoreceptor complexes and immune cell function.",2024,Alzheimer disease; Microglia; Nasu-Hakola disease; Neurodegeneration; Neuroinflammation; Phosphorylation,"Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Receptors, Immunologic; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Secretory Pathway; Membrane Proteins; HEK293 Cells; Signal Transduction; Phagocytosis; Macrophages; Protein Transport; Protein Binding; Animals; Golgi Apparatus; Vesicular Transport Proteins; Cell Membrane","Liu, Y; Theil, S; Ibach, M; Walter, J"
A Comprehensive Head-to-Head Comparison of Key Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 Biomarker Tests.,"Plasma phosphorylated-tau 217 (p-tau217) is currently the most promising biomarkers for reliable detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.

Genetic and multi-omic resources for Alzheimer disease and related dementia from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center.,"The Knight-Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC) at Washington University in St. Louis has pioneered and led worldwide seminal studies that have expanded our clinical, social, pathological, and molecular understanding of Alzheimer Disease. Over more than 40 years, research volunteers have been recruited to participate in cognitive, neuropsychologic, imaging, fluid biomarkers, genomic and multi-omic studies. Tissue and longitudinal data collected to foster, facilitate, and support research on dementia and aging. The Genetics and high throughput -omics core (GHTO) have collected of more than 26,000 biological samples from 6,625 Knight-ADRC participants. Samples available include longitudinal DNA, RNA, non-fasted plasma, cerebrospinal fluid pellets, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The GHTO has performed deep molecular profiling (genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) from large number of brain (n = 2,117), CSF (n = 2,012) and blood/plasma (n = 8,265) samples with the goal of identifying novel risk and protective variants, identify novel molecular biomarkers and causal and druggable targets.

Antigen-specific age-related memory CD8 T cells induce and track Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration.,"Cerebral (Aβ) plaque and (pTau) tangle deposition are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet are insufficient to confer complete AD-like neurodegeneration experimentally. Factors acting upstream of Aβ/pTau in AD remain unknown, but their identification could enable earlier diagnosis and more effective treatments. T cell abnormalities are emerging AD hallmarks, and CD8 T cells were recently found to mediate neurodegeneration downstream of tangle deposition in hereditary neurodegeneration models. The precise impact of T cells downstream of Aβ/pTau, however, appears to vary depending on the animal model.

Predicting Longitudinal Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Conversion in Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients Based on Plasma Biomarkers.,"The increasing burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) emphasizes the need for effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Despite available treatments targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, disease-modifying therapies remain elusive. Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients at risk for AD conversion is crucial, especially with anti-Aβ therapy. While plasma biomarkers hold promise in differentiating AD from MCI, evidence on predicting cognitive decline is lacking. This study's objectives were to evaluate whether plasma protein biomarkers could predict both cognitive decline in non-demented individuals and the conversion to AD in patients with MCI. This study was conducted as part of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia (KLOSCAD), a prospective, community-based cohort. Participants were based on plasma biomarker availability and clinical diagnosis at baseline. The study included MCI (n = 50), MCI-to-AD (n = 21), and cognitively unimpaired (CU, n = 40) participants. Baseline plasma concentrations of six proteins-total tau (tTau), phosphorylated tau at residue 181 (pTau181), amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), amyloid beta 40 (Aβ40), neurofilament light chain (NFL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-along with three derivative ratios (pTau181/tTau, Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181/Aβ42) were analyzed to predict cognitive decline over a six-year follow-up period. Baseline protein biomarkers were stratified into tertiles (low, intermediate, and high) and analyzed using a linear mixed model (LMM) to predict longitudinal cognitive changes. In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to discern whether protein biomarkers could predict AD conversion in the MCI subgroup. This prospective cohort study revealed that plasma NFL may predict longitudinal declines in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. In participants categorized as amyloid positive, the NFL biomarker demonstrated predictive performance for both MMSE and total scores of the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Packet (CERAD-TS) longitudinally. Additionally, as a baseline predictor, GFAP exhibited a significant association with cross-sectional cognitive impairment in the CERAD-TS measure, particularly in amyloid positive participants. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis indicated predictive performance of NFL, GFAP, tTau, and Aβ42/Aβ40 on MCI-to-AD conversion. This study suggests that plasma GFAP in non-demented participants may reflect baseline cross-sectional CERAD-TS scores, a measure of global cognitive function. Conversely, plasma NFL may predict longitudinal decline in MMSE and CERAD-TS scores in participants categorized as amyloid positive. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis suggests that NFL, GFAP, tTau, and Aβ42/Aβ40 are potentially robust predictors of future AD conversion.",2024,MCI-to-AD conversion; cognitive decline; linear mixed model; neuropsychological measure; plasma biomarker,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Female; Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Disease Progression; Neurofilament Proteins; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Prospective Studies,"Park, MK; Ahn, J; Kim, YJ; Lee, JW; Lee, JC; Hwang, SJ; Kim, KC"

Eta-secretase-like processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the rhomboid protease RHBDL4.,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key protein in Alzheimer's disease synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and translocated to the plasma membrane where it undergoes proteolytic cleavages by several proteases. Conversely to other known proteases, we previously elucidated rhomboid protease RHBDL4 as a novel APP processing enzyme where several cleavages likely occur already in the ER. Interestingly, the pattern of RHBDL4-derived large APP C-terminal fragments resemble those generated by the η-secretase or MT5-MMP, which was described to generate so called Aη fragments. The similarity in large APP C-terminal fragments between both proteases raised the question whether RHBDL4 may contribute to η-secretase activity and Aη-like fragments. Here, we identified two cleavage sites of RHBDL4 in APP by mass spectrometry, which, intriguingly, lie in close proximity to the MT5-MMP cleavage sites. Indeed, we observed that RHBDL4 generates Aη-like fragments in vitro without contributions of α-, β-, or γ-secretases. Such Aη-like fragments are likely generated in the ER since RHBDL4-derived APP-C-terminal fragments do not reach the cell surface. Inherited, familial APP mutations appear to not affect this processing pathway. In RHBDL4 knockout mice, we observed increased cerebral full length APP in comparison to wild type (WT) in support of RHBDL4 being a physiologically relevant protease for APP. Furthermore, we found secreted Aη fragments in dissociated mixed cortical cultures from WT mice, however significantly less Aη fragments in RHBDL4 knockout cultures. Our data underscores that RHBDL4 contributes to η-secretease-like processing of APP and that RHBDL4 is a physiologically relevant protease for APP.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Aη; MMP24; MT5-MMP; RHBDD1; RHBDL4; amyloid precursor protein (APP); eta-secretase; rhomboid protease,,"Penalva, YCM; Paschkowsky, S; Recinto, SJ; Duchesne, A; Hammond, T; Spiegler, P; Jansen, G; Levet, C; Charron, F; Freeman, M; McKinney, RA; Trempe, JF; Munter, LM"
Evaluation of core Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in saliva and plasma measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays on a fully automated platform.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid peptide beta-42 (Aβ42), Aβ42/40 ratio, and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are precious tools for supporting AD diagnosis. However, their use in clinical practice is limited due to the invasiveness of CSF collection. Thus, there is intensive research to find alternative, noninvasive, and widely accessible biological matrices to measure AD core biomarkers. In this study, we measured AD core biomarkers in saliva and plasma by a fully automated platform. We enrolled all consecutive patients with cognitive decline. For each patient, we measured Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau levels in CSF, saliva, and plasma by Lumipulse G1200 (Fujirebio). We included forty-two patients, of whom 27 had AD. Levels of all biomarkers significantly differed in the three biofluids, with saliva having the lowest and CSF the highest levels of Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau. A positive correlation of pTau, Aβ42/40 ratio, and pTau/Aβ42 ratio levels in CSF and plasma was detected, while no correlation between any biomarker in CSF and saliva was found. Our findings suggest that plasma but not saliva could represent a surrogate biofluid for measuring core AD biomarkers. Specifically, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, pTau/Aβ42 ratio, and pTau could serve as surrogates of the corresponding CSF biomarkers.",2024,AD; Beta-amyloid; Biomarker; Fujirebio; Plasma; Saliva; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Saliva; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments; Luminescent Measurements; Aged, 80 and over","Agnello, L; Giglio, RV; Del Ben, F; Piccoli, T; Colletti, T; Scazzone, C; Lo Sasso, B; Ciaccio, AM; Gambino, CM; Salemi, G; Ciaccio, M"

We report first-in-human, phase I, double-blind, dose-finding studies to assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical pharmacology of dalzanemdor. A single-ascending dose study (dalzanemdor 0.35, 0.75, 1.5, or 3.0 mg vs. placebo) was conducted in healthy participants and included food effects.

Dalzanemdor was generally well tolerated with no adverse events leading to discontinuation. Dalzanemdor exhibited pharmacokinetic parameters appropriate for once-daily dosing. Following single and multiple doses in healthy participants, median terminal half-life was 8-118 h, and the median time to reach maximum plasma concentration was 4-7 h. Exposures were dose-proportional after single dose (6-46 ng/mL) and more than dose-proportional after multiple doses (6-41 ng/mL). With multiple dosing, a steady state was achieved after 11 days in healthy participants and 13 days in HD participants. Dalzanemdor exposure decreased slightly with food. In HD participants, results suggest that dalzanemdor may improve cognitive performance on tests of executive function.

Exploratory Mass Spectrometry of Cerebrospinal Fluid from Persons with Autopsy-Confirmed LATE-NC.,"Common neuropathologies associated with dementia include Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). Biofluid proteomics provides a window into the pathobiology of dementia and the information from biofluid tests may help guide clinical management. Participants (n = 29) had been autopsied and had antemortem CSF draws in a longitudinal cohort of older adults at the University of Kentucky AD Research Center. Cases were designated as LATE-NC + if they had LATE-NC stage > 1 (n = 9); the remaining 20 cases were designated LATE-NC-. This convenience sample of CSF specimens was analyzed in two separate processes: From one group, aliquots were depleted of highly abundant proteins using affinity spin columns. Tryptic digests of sample proteins were subjected to liquid chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry. Relative quantification was performed using Sciex software. Peptides referent to a total of 949 proteins were identified in the samples depleted of abundant proteins, and 820 different proteins were identified in the non-depleted samples. When the Bonferroni/false-discovery statistical correction was applied to account for having made multiple comparison tests, only 4 proteins showed differential expression (LATE-NC + vs LATE-NC-) in the non-depleted samples (RBP4, MIF, IGHG3, and ITM2B). Post hoc western blots confirmed that RBP4 expression was higher in the LATE-NC + cases at the group level. In summary, an exploratory assessment of proteomes of autopsy-confirmed LATE-NC and non-LATE-NC CSF did not demonstrate a clear-cut proteomic fingerprint that distinguished the two groups.

The anti-inflammatory effects of itaconate and its derivatives in neurological disorders.,"Almost 16 % of the global population is affected by neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative and cerebral neuroimmune diseases, triggered by acute or chronic inflammation. Neuroinflammation is recognized as a common pathogenic mechanism in a wide array of neurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. Inflammatory process in the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to neuronal damage and neuronal apoptosis, consequently exacerbating these diseases. Itaconate, an immunomodulatory metabolite from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, suppresses neuroinflammation and modulates the CNS immune response. Emerging human studies suggest that itaconate levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid may serve as biomarkers associated with inflammatory responses in neurological disorders. Preclinical studies have shown that itaconate and its highly cell-permeable derivatives are promising candidates for preventing and treating neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders. The underlying mechanism may involve the regulation of immune cells in the CNS and neuroinflammation-related signaling pathways and molecules including Nrf2/KEAP1 signaling pathway, reactive oxygen species, and NLRP3 inflammasome. Here, we introduce the metabolism and function of itaconate and the synthesis and development of its derivatives. We summarize the potential impact and therapeutic potential of itaconate and its derivatives on brain immune cells and the associated signaling pathways and molecules, based on preclinical evidence via various neurological disorder models.

In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we quantified 942 immunological proteins in plasma and identified 32 (including CAT [catalase], CD36 [CD36 antigen], and KRT19 [keratin 19]) associated with rates of cortical Aβ accumulation measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Longitudinal changes in a subset of candidate proteins also predicted Aβ progression, and the mid- to late-life (20-year) trajectory of one protein, CAT, was associated with late-life Aβ-positive status in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Genetic variation that influenced plasma levels of CAT, CD36 and KRT19 predicted rates of Aβ accumulation, including causal relationships with Aβ PET levels identified with two-sample Mendelian randomization. In addition to associations with tau PET and plasma AD biomarker changes, as well as expression patterns in human microglia subtypes and neurovascular cells in AD brain tissue, we showed that 31 % of candidate proteins were related to mid-life (20-year) or late-life (8-year) dementia risk in ARIC.

N-Glycosylation Deficiency in Transgene α7 nAChR and RIC3 Expressing CHO Cells Without NACHO.,"The human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 (nAChR) is an important target implicated in diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, as well as a validated target for drug discovery. For α7 nAChR model systems, correct folding and ion influx functions are essential. Two chaperones, resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 3 (RIC3) and novel nAChR regulator (NACHO), enhance the assembly and function of α7 nAChR. This study investigates the consequence of NACHO absence on α7 nAChR expression and function. Therefore, the sequences of human α7 nAChR and human RIC3 were transduced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Protein expression and function of α7 nAChR were confirmed by Western blot and voltage clamp, respectively. Cellular viability was assessed by cell proliferation and lactate dehydrogenase assays. Intracellular and extracellular expression were determined by in/on-cell Western, compared with another nAChR subtype by novel cluster fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay, and N-glycosylation efficiency was assessed by glycosylation digest. The transgene CHO cell line showed expected protein expression and function for α7 nAChR and cell viability was barely influenced by overexpression. While intracellular levels of α7 nAChR were as anticipated, plasma membrane insertion was low. The glycosylation digest revealed no appreciable N-glycosylation product. This study demonstrates a stable and functional cell line expressing α7 nAChR, whose protein expression, function, and viability are not affected by the absence of NACHO. The reduced plasma membrane insertion of α7 nAChR, combined with incorrect matured N-glycosylation at the Golgi apparatus, suggests a loss of recognition signal for lectin sorting.",2024,N-Glycosylation; NACHO; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; RIC3,,"Brockmöller, S; Molitor, LM; Seeger, T; Worek, F; Rothmiller, S"
Revealing the mechanisms of blood-brain barrier in chronic neurodegenerative disease: an opportunity for therapeutic intervention.,"The brain microenvironment is tightly regulated, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system. It effectively safeguards brain tissue from harmful substances in peripheral blood. However, both acute pathological factors and age-related biodegradation have the potential to compromise the integrity of the BBB and are associated with chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as Epilepsy (EP). This association arises due to infiltration of peripheral foreign bodies including microorganisms, immune-inflammatory mediators, and plasma proteins into the central nervous system when the BBB is compromised. Nevertheless, these partial and generalized understandings do not prompt a shift from passive to active treatment approaches. Therefore, it is imperative to acquire a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying vascular disease alterations associated with the onset and progression of chronic neurodegenerative disorders, as well as the subsequent homeostatic changes triggered by BBB impairment. The present article aims to systematically summarize and review recent scientific work with a specific focus on elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying BBB damage in AD, PD, and EP as well as their consequential impact on disease progression. These findings not only offer guidance for optimizing the physiological function of the BBB, but also provide valuable insights for developing intervention strategies aimed at early restoration of BBB structural integrity, thereby laying a solid foundation for designing drug delivery strategies centered around the BBB.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; blood-brain barrier; chronic neurodegenerative disease; epilepsy,,"Yu, S; Chen, X; Yang, T; Cheng, J; Liu, E; Jiang, L; Song, M; Shu, H; Ma, Y"

Unexpected Low Rate of Amyloid-β Pathology in Multiple Sclerosis Patients.,"The life expectancy of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) has increased, yet we have noted that development of a typical Alzheimer disease dementia syndrome is uncommon. We hypothesized that Alzheimer disease pathology is uncommon in MS patients. In 100 MS patients, the rate of amyloid-β plasma biomarker positivity was approximately half the rate in 300 non-MS controls matched on age, sex, apolipoprotein E proteotype, and cognitive status. Interestingly, most MS patients who did have amyloid-β pathology had features atypical for MS at diagnosis.

Transcriptomic and metabolomic changes might predict frailty in SAMP8 mice.,"Frailty is a geriatric, multi-dimensional syndrome that reflects multisystem physiological change and is a transversal measure of reduced resilience to negative events. It is characterized by weakness, frequent falls, cognitive decline, increased hospitalization and dead and represents a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The fact that frailty is recognized as a reversible condition encourages the identification of earlier biomarkers to timely predict and prevent its occurrence. SAMP8 (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone-8) mice represent the most appropriate preclinical model to this aim and were used in this study to carry transcriptional and metabolic analyses in the brain and plasma, respectively, upon a characterization at cognitive, motor, structural, and neuropathological level at 2.5, 6, and 9 months of age. At 2.5 months, SAMP8 mice started displaying memory deficits, muscle weakness, and motor impairment. Functional alterations were associated with a neurodevelopmental deficiency associated with reduced neuronal density and glial cell loss. Through transcriptomics, we identified specific genetic signatures well distinguishing SAMP8 mice at 6 months, whereas plasma metabolomics allowed to segregate SAMP8 mice from SAMR1 already at 2.5 months of age by detecting constitutively lower levels of acylcarnitines and lipids in SAMP8 at all ages investigated correlating with functional deficits and neuropathological signs. Our findings suggest that specific genetic alterations at central level, as well as metabolomic changes in plasma, might allow to early assess a frail condition leading to dementia development, which paves the foundation for future investigation in a clinical setting.",2024,aging; dementia; frailty; motor impairment; neuronal loss; predictive biomarkers; senescent SAMP8 mice,,"Dacomo, L; La Vitola, P; Brunelli, L; Messa, L; Micotti, E; Artioli, L; Sinopoli, E; Cecutti, G; Leva, S; Gagliardi, S; Pansarasa, O; Carelli, S; Guaita, A; Pastorelli, R; Forloni, G; Cereda, C; Balducci, C"

Multiple Roles of Apolipoprotein E4 in Oxidative Lipid Metabolism and Ferroptosis During the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide and has a great socio-economic impact. Modified oxidative lipid metabolism and dysregulated iron homeostasis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder, but the detailed pathophysiological mechanisms still remain unclear. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a lipid-binding protein that occurs in large quantities in human blood plasma, and a polymorphism of the APOE gene locus has been identified as risk factors for AD. The human genome involves three major APOE alleles (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4), which encode for three subtly distinct apolipoprotein E isoforms (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4). The canonic function of these apolipoproteins is lipid transport in blood and brain, but APOE4 allele carriers have a much higher risk for AD. In fact, about 60% of clinically diagnosed AD patients carry at least one APOE4 allele in their genomes. Although the APOE4 protein has been implicated in pathophysiological key processes of AD, such as extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, formation of neurofibrillary tangles, modified oxidative lipid metabolism, and ferroptotic cell death, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not well understood. As for all mammalian cells, iron plays a crucial role in neuronal functions and dysregulation of iron homeostasis has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Imbalances in iron homeostasis and impairment of the hydroperoxy lipid-reducing capacity induce cellular dysfunction leading to neuronal ferroptosis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on APOE4-related oxidative lipid metabolism and the potential role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of AD. Pharmacological interference with these processes might offer innovative strategies for therapeutic interventions.",2024,Free radicals; Glutathione peroxidase 4; Iron homeostasis; Lipid peroxidation; Neurodegeneration; Proteostasis,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Ferroptosis; Lipid Metabolism; Apolipoprotein E4; Animals; Iron,"Faraji, P; Kühn, H; Ahmadian, S"

Plasma levels of adipokines and insulin are associated with markers of brain atrophy and cognitive decline in the spectrum of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The discovery that metabolic alterations often coexist with neurodegenerative conditions has sparked interest in the examination of metabolic regulatory factors as potential modulators of brain health. Here, we examined the role of adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and IL6) and insulin on different markers of brain atrophy in participants on the spectrum of Alzheimer's Disease. We included 566 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with 1063 follow-up time points (average follow-up: one year); and examined the association between metabolic regulatory factors and volumetric MRI values, white matter hyperintensities, and measures of cognitive impairment. Higher leptin, resistin, IL6, and insulin were associated with markers of cerebral atrophy, such as lower total brain volume, or higher ventricular volume. Higher leptin and resistin were also associated with greater impairment in daily life activities. Higher adiponectin was associated with lower ventricle volume. There was no association between adipokines or insulin with white matter hyperintensities.

The clinical practice of employing single-molecule array (Simoa) technology for routine use in patient care is limited by the high costs. Herein, we developed a microarray chip-based high-throughput screening method and screened an attractive self-assembling peptide targeting NfL. Through directly ""imprinting"" and further analyzing the sequences, morphology, and affinity of the identified self-assembling peptides, the Pep-NfL peptide nanosheet with high binding affinity toward NfL (",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; blood biomarker; imprinting; neurofilament light chain; self-assembly peptide,Alzheimer Disease; Neurofilament Proteins; Animals; Humans; Mice; Peptides; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Biomarkers; Protein Array Analysis,"Zhou, Y; Cai, G; Wang, Y; Guo, Y; Yang, Z; Wang, A; Chen, Y; Li, X; Chen, X; Hu, Z; Wang, Z"

"Association of glial fibrillary acid protein, Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline.","Increasing evidence shows that neuroinflammation is a possible modulator of tau spread effects on cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. In this context, plasma levels of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have been suggested to have a robust association with Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. This study aims to assess the correlation between plasma GFAP and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and their synergistic effect on cognitive performance and decline. A cohort of 122 memory clinic subjects with amyloid and tau positron emission tomography, MRI scans, plasma GFAP, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was included in the study. A subsample of 94 subjects had a follow-up MMSE score at least one year after baseline. Regional and voxel-based correlations between Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and plasma GFAP were assessed. Mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of plasma GFAP on the association between amyloid and tau PET, and tau PET and cognitive impairment and decline. GFAP was associated with increased tau PET ligand uptake in the lateral temporal and inferior temporal lobes in a strong left-sided pattern independently of age, gender, education, amyloid, and APOE status (β=0.001, p < 0.01). The annual rate of MMSE change was significantly and independently correlated with both GFAP (β=0.006, p < 0.01) and global tau SUVR (β=4.33, p < 0.01), but not with amyloid burden. Partial mediation effects of GFAP were found on the association between amyloid and tau pathology (13.7%), and between tau pathology and cognitive decline (17.4%), but not on global cognition at baseline. Neuroinflammation measured by circulating GFAP is independently associated with tau Alzheimer's disease pathology and with cognitive decline, suggesting neuroinflammation as a potential target for future disease-modifying trials targeting tau pathology. Peretti et al. show that a circulatory marker of neuroinflammation-glial fibrillary acidic protein-is associated with tau pathology in lateral temporal and frontal regions in patients with Alzheimer's disease, independent of amyloid load.

Elevated homocysteine is associated with increased rates of epigenetic aging in a population with mild cognitive impairment.,"Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. In this study, we report the relationship between tHcy and epigenetic age in older adults with mild cognitive impairment from the VITACOG study. Epigenetic age and rate of aging (ROA) were assessed using various epigenetic clocks, including those developed by Horvath and Hannum, DNAmPhenoAge, and with a focus on Index, a new principal component-based epigenetic clock that, like DNAmPhenoAge, is trained to predict an individual's ""PhenoAge."" We identified significant associations between tHcy levels and ROA, suggesting that hyperhomocysteinemic individuals were aging at a faster rate. Moreover, Index revealed a normalization of accelerated epigenetic aging in these individuals following treatment with tHcy-lowering B-vitamins. Our results indicate that elevated tHcy is a risk factor for accelerated epigenetic aging, and this can be ameliorated with B-vitamins. These findings have broad relevance for the sizable proportion of the worldwide population with elevated tHcy.",2024,B‐vitamins; DNA methylation; epigenetic age; homocysteine,,"Holmes, HE; Valentin, RE; Jernerén, F; de Jager Loots, CA; Refsum, H; Smith, AD; Guarente, L; Dellinger, RW; Sampson, D"
Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's Association Workgroup.,"The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened three separate work groups in 2011 and single work groups in 2012 and 2018 to create recommendations for the diagnosis and characterization of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present document updates the 2018 research framework in response to several recent developments. Defining diseases biologically, rather than based on syndromic presentation, has long been standard in many areas of medicine (e.g., oncology), and is becoming a unifying concept common to all neurodegenerative diseases, not just AD. The present document is consistent with this principle. Our intent is to present objective criteria for diagnosis and staging AD, incorporating recent advances in biomarkers, to serve as a bridge between research and clinical care. These criteria are not intended to provide step-by-step clinical practice guidelines for clinical workflow or specific treatment protocols, but rather serve as general principles to inform diagnosis and staging of AD that reflect current science. HIGHLIGHTS: We define Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be a biological process that begins with the appearance of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC) while people are asymptomatic. Progression of the neuropathologic burden leads to the later appearance and progression of clinical symptoms. Early-changing Core 1 biomarkers (amyloid positron emission tomography [PET], approved cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and accurate plasma biomarkers [especially phosphorylated tau 217]) map onto either the amyloid beta or AD tauopathy pathway; however, these reflect the presence of ADNPC more generally (i.e., both neuritic plaques and tangles). An abnormal Core 1 biomarker result is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of AD and to inform clinical decision making throughout the disease continuum. Later-changing Core 2 biomarkers (biofluid and tau PET) can provide prognostic information, and when abnormal, will increase confidence that AD is contributing to symptoms. An integrated biological and clinical staging scheme is described that accommodates the fact that common copathologies, cognitive reserve, and resistance may modify relationships between clinical and biological AD stages.",2024,Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; Alzheimer's disease imaging; Alzheimer's disease staging; amyloid positron emission tomography; biofluid biomarkers Alzheimer's disease; biomarkers Alzheimer's disease; preclinical Alzheimer's disease; tau positron emission tomography,,"Jack, CR; Andrews, JS; Beach, TG; Buracchio, T; Dunn, B; Graf, A; Hansson, O; Ho, C; Jagust, W; McDade, E; Molinuevo, JL; Okonkwo, OC; Pani, L; Rafii, MS; Scheltens, P; Siemers, E; Snyder, HM; Sperling, R; Teunissen, CE; Carrillo, MC"
SKArred 2 death: neuroinflammatory breakdown of the hippocampus.,"A multitude of cellular responses to intrinsic and extrinsic signals converge on macroautophagy/autophagy, a conserved catabolic process that degrades cytoplasmic constituents and organelles in the lysosome, particularly during starvation or stress. In addition to protein degradation, autophagy is deeply interconnected with unconventional protein secretion and polarized sorting at multiple levels within eukaryotic cells. Secretory autophagy (SA) has been recognized as a novel mechanism in which autophagosomes fuse with the plasma membrane and actively participate in the secretion of a series of cytosolic proteins, ranging from tissue remodeling factors to inflammatory molecules of the IL1 family. SA is partially controlled by the glucocorticoid-responsive, HSP90 co-chaperone FKBP5 and members of the SNARE proteins, SEC22B, SNAP23, SNAP29, STX3 and STX4. SA deregulation is implicated in several inflammatory pathologies, including cancer, cell death and degeneration. However, the key molecular mechanisms governing SA and its regulation remain elusive, as does its role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. To further characterize SA and pinpoint its involvement in neuroinflammatory processes, we studied SA-relevant protein interaction networks in mouse brain, microglia and human postmortem brain tissue from control subjects and Alzheimer disease cases. We demonstrate that SA regulates neuroinflammation-mediated neurodegeneration via SKA2 and FKBP5 signaling.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; FKBP5; SKA2; hippocampus; neuroinflammation; secretory autophagy,,"Bajaj, T; Ebert, T; Dillmann, LJ; Sokn, C; Gassen, NC; Hartmann, J"
Implementation of Modern Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Lipidomics Approaches in Clinical Practice: A Case Study with Colistin Treatment.,"Nowadays, lipidomics plays a crucial role in the investigation of novel biomarkers of various diseases. Its implementation into the field of clinical analysis led to the identification of specific lipids and/or significant changes in their plasma levels in patients suffering from cancer, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, and many other diseases and pathological conditions. Profiling of lipids and determination of their plasma concentrations could also be helpful in the case of drug therapy management, especially in combination with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

Understanding Aβ Peptide Binding to Lipid Membranes: A Biophysical Perspective.,"Aβ peptides are known to bind neural plasma membranes in a process leading to the deposit of Aβ-enriched plaques. These extracellular structures are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, the major cause of late-age dementia. The mechanisms of Aβ plaque formation and deposition are far from being understood. A vast number of studies in the literature describe the efforts to analyze those mechanisms using a variety of tools. The present review focuses on biophysical studies mostly carried out with model membranes or with computational tools. This review starts by describing basic physical aspects of lipid phases and commonly used model membranes (monolayers and bilayers). This is followed by a discussion of the biophysical techniques applied to these systems, mainly but not exclusively Langmuir monolayers, isothermal calorimetry, density-gradient ultracentrifugation, and molecular dynamics. The Methodological Section is followed by the core of the review, which includes a summary of important results obtained with each technique. The last section is devoted to an overall reflection and an effort to understand Aβ-bilayer binding. Concepts such as Aβ peptide membrane binding, adsorption, and insertion are defined and differentiated. The roles of membrane lipid order, nanodomain formation, and electrostatic forces in Aβ-membrane interaction are separately identified and discussed.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ membrane binding; Aβ42; Langmuir balance; cholesterol; ganglioside; isothermal calorimetry; sphingomyelin; β-amyloid,Amyloid beta-Peptides; Humans; Lipid Bilayers; Membrane Lipids; Protein Binding; Cell Membrane; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Biophysical Phenomena; Molecular Dynamics Simulation,"Ahyayauch, H; Masserini, ME; Alonso, A; Goñi, FM"

An interpretable machine learning-based cerebrospinal fluid proteomics clock for predicting age reveals novel insights into brain aging.,"Machine learning can be used to create ""biologic clocks"" that predict age. However, organs, tissues, and biofluids may age at different rates from the organism as a whole. We sought to understand how cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes with age to inform the development of brain aging-related disease mechanisms and identify potential anti-aging therapeutic targets. Several epigenetic clocks exist based on plasma and neuronal tissues; however, plasma may not reflect brain aging specifically and tissue-based clocks require samples that are difficult to obtain from living participants. To address these problems, we developed a machine learning clock that uses CSF proteomics to predict the chronological age of individuals with a 0.79 Pearson correlation and mean estimated error (MAE) of 4.30 years in our validation cohort. Additionally, we analyzed proteins highly weighted by the algorithm to gain insights into changes in CSF and uncover novel insights into brain aging. We also demonstrate a novel method to create a minimal protein clock that uses just 109 protein features from the original clock to achieve a similar accuracy (0.75 correlation, MAE 5.41). Finally, we demonstrate that our clock identifies novel proteins that are highly predictive of age in interactions with other proteins, but do not directly correlate with chronological age themselves. In conclusion, we propose that our CSF protein aging clock can identify novel proteins that influence the rate of aging of the central nervous system (CNS), in a manner that would not be identifiable by examining their individual relationships with age.",2024,aging; brain aging; cerebrospinal fluid; neurodegeneration; neurodegenerative diseases; proteomics,,"Melendez, J; Sung, YJ; Orr, M; Yoo, A; Schindler, S; Cruchaga, C; Bateman, R"

Plasma proteomics in the UK Biobank reveals youthful brains and immune systems promote healthspan and longevity.,"Organ-derived plasma protein signatures derived from aptamer protein arrays track organ-specific aging, disease, and mortality in humans, but the robustness and clinical utility of these models and their biological underpinnings remain unknown. Here, we estimate biological age of 11 organs from 44,526 individuals in the UK Biobank using an antibody-based proteomics platform to model disease and mortality risk. Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimer's disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements.

"Microstructural associations between locus coeruleus, cortical, and subcortical regions are modulated by astrocyte reactivity: a 7T MRI adult lifespan study.","The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system plays a key role in supporting brain health along the lifespan, notably through its modulatory effects on neuroinflammation. Using ultra-high field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, we examined whether microstructural properties (neurite density index and orientation dispersion index) in the locus coeruleus were related to those in cortical and subcortical regions, and whether this was modulated by plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein levels, as a proxy of astrocyte reactivity. In our cohort of 60 healthy individuals (30 to 85 yr, 50% female), higher glial fibrillary acidic protein correlated with lower neurite density index in frontal cortical regions, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. Furthermore, under higher levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (above ~ 150 pg/mL for cortical and ~ 145 pg/mL for subcortical regions), lower locus coeruleus orientation dispersion index was associated with lower orientation dispersion index in frontotemporal cortical regions and in subcortical regions. Interestingly, individuals with higher locus coeruleus orientation dispersion index exhibited higher orientation dispersion index in these (sub)cortical regions, despite having higher glial fibrillary acidic protein levels. Together, these results suggest that the interaction between locus coeruleus-norepinephrine cells and astrocytes can signal a detrimental or neuroprotective pathway for brain integrity and support the importance of maintaining locus coeruleus neuronal health in aging and in the prevention of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,GFAP; NODDI; aging; brain microstructure; locus coeruleus,"Humans; Female; Male; Locus Coeruleus; Astrocytes; Aged; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cerebral Cortex; Brain; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neurites","Beckers, E; Van Egroo, M; Ashton, NJ; Blennow, K; Vandewalle, G; Zetterberg, H; Poser, BA; Jacobs, HIL"

Central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles: the next generation of neural circulating biomarkers?,"The central nervous system (CNS) is integrated by glial and neuronal cells, and both release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in CNS homeostasis. EVs could be one of the best candidates to operate as nanosized biological platforms for analysing multidimensional bioactive cargos, which are protected during systemic circulation of EVs. Having a window into the molecular level processes that are happening in the CNS could open a new avenue in CNS research. This raises a particular point of interest: can CNS-derived EVs in blood serve as circulating biomarkers that reflect the pathological status of neurological diseases? L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) is a widely reported biomarker to identify CNS-derived EVs in peripheral blood. However, it has been demonstrated that L1CAM is also expressed outside the CNS. Given that principal data related to neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease were obtained using L1CAM-positive EVs, efforts to overcome present challenges related to its specificity are required. In this sense, other surface biomarkers for CNS-derived EVs, such as glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), among others, have started to be used. Establishing a panel of EV biomarkers to analyse CNS-derived EVs in blood could increase the specificity and sensitivity necessary for these types of studies. This review covers the main evidence related to CNS-derived EVs in cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples of patients with neurological diseases, focusing on the reported biomarkers and the technical possibilities for their isolation. EVs are emerging as a mirror of brain physiopathology, reflecting both localized and systemic changes. Therefore, when the technical hindrances for EV research and clinical applications are overcome, novel disease-specific panels of EV biomarkers would be discovered to facilitate transformation from traditional medicine to personalized medicine.",2024,Brain-derived EVs; Central nervous system-derived EVs; Cerebrospinal fluid EVs; Circulating biomarkers; Extracellular vesicles; Neural-derived EVs; Neurodegenerative diseases; Plasma EVs,Humans; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Central Nervous System; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Animals,"Bravo-Miana, RDC; Arizaga-Echebarria, JK; Otaegui, D"

Plasma extracellular vesicle tau and TDP-43 as diagnostic biomarkers in FTD and ALS.,"Minimally invasive biomarkers are urgently needed to detect molecular pathology in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we show that plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain quantifiable amounts of TDP-43 and full-length tau, which allow the quantification of 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) tau isoforms. Plasma EV TDP-43 levels and EV 3R/4R tau ratios were determined in a cohort of 704 patients, including 37 genetically and 31 neuropathologically proven cases. Diagnostic groups comprised patients with TDP-43 proteinopathy ALS, 4R tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy, behavior variant FTD (bvFTD) as a group with either tau or TDP-43 pathology, and healthy controls. EV tau ratios were low in progressive supranuclear palsy and high in bvFTD with tau pathology. EV TDP-43 levels were high in ALS and in bvFTD with TDP-43 pathology. Both markers discriminated between the diagnostic groups with area under the curve values >0.9, and between TDP-43 and tau pathology in bvFTD. Both markers strongly correlated with neurodegeneration, and clinical and neuropsychological markers of disease severity. Findings were replicated in an independent validation cohort of 292 patients including 34 genetically confirmed cases. Taken together, the combination of EV TDP-43 levels and EV 3R/4R tau ratios may aid the molecular diagnosis of FTD, FTD spectrum disorders and ALS, providing a potential biomarker to monitor disease progression and target engagement in clinical trials.",2024,,"Humans; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; tau Proteins; Extracellular Vesicles; Frontotemporal Dementia; Biomarkers; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; Protein Isoforms","Chatterjee, M; Özdemir, S; Fritz, C; Möbius, W; Kleineidam, L; Mandelkow, E; Biernat, J; Doğdu, C; Peters, O; Cosma, NC; Wang, X; Schneider, LS; Priller, J; Spruth, E; Kühn, AA; Krause, P; Klockgether, T; Vogt, IR; Kimmich, O; Spottke, A; Hoffmann, DC; Fliessbach, K; Miklitz, C; McCormick, C; Weydt, P; Falkenburger, B; Brandt, M; Guenther, R; Dinter, E; Wiltfang, J; Hansen, N; Bähr, M; Zerr, I; Flöel, A; Nestor, PJ; Düzel, E; Glanz, W; Incesoy, E; Bürger, K; Janowitz, D; Perneczky, R; Rauchmann, BS; Hopfner, F; Wagemann, O; Levin, J; Teipel, S; Kilimann, I; Goerss, D; Prudlo, J; Gasser, T; Brockmann, K; Mengel, D; Zimmermann, M; Synofzik, M; Wilke, C; Selma-González, J; Turon-Sans, J; Santos-Santos, MA; Alcolea, D; Rubio-Guerra, S; Fortea, J; Carbayo, Á; Lleó, A; Rojas-García, R; Illán-Gala, I; Wagner, M; Frommann, I; Roeske, S; Bertram, L; Heneka, MT; Brosseron, F; Ramirez, A; Schmid, M; Beschorner, R; Halle, A; Herms, J; Neumann, M; Barthélemy, NR; Bateman, RJ; Rizzu, P; Heutink, P; Dols-Icardo, O; Höglinger, G; Hermann, A; Schneider, A"
The Alzheimer's disease-linked protease BACE2 cleaves VEGFR3 and modulates its signaling.,"The β-secretase BACE1 is a central drug target for Alzheimer's disease. Clinically tested, BACE1-directed inhibitors also block the homologous protease BACE2. Yet, little is known about physiological BACE2 substrates and functions in vivo. Here, we identify BACE2 as the protease shedding the lymphangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3). Inactivation of BACE2, but not BACE1, inhibited shedding of VEGFR3 from primary human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and reduced release of the shed, soluble VEGFR3 (sVEGFR3) ectodomain into the blood of mice, non-human primates and humans. Functionally, BACE2 inactivation increased full-length VEGFR3 and enhanced VEGFR3 signaling in LECs and also in vivo in zebrafish, where enhanced migration of LECs was observed. Thus, this study identifies BACE2 as a modulator of lymphangiogenic VEGFR3 signaling and demonstrates the utility of sVEGFR3 as a pharmacodynamic plasma marker for BACE2 activity in vivo, a prerequisite for developing BACE1-selective inhibitors for a safer prevention of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Aging; Alzheimer disease; Drug therapy,,"Schmidt, A; Hrupka, B; van Bebber, F; Sunil Kumar, S; Feng, X; Tschirner, SK; Aßfalg, M; Müller, SA; Hilger, LS; Hofmann, LI; Pigoni, M; Jocher, G; Voytyuk, I; Self, EL; Ito, M; Hyakkoku, K; Yoshimura, A; Horiguchi, N; Feederle, R; De Strooper, B; Schulte-Merker, S; Lammert, E; Moechars, D; Schmid, B; Lichtenthaler, SF"

Advances in blood biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD): A review.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are growing public health challenges globally affecting millions of older adults, necessitating concerted efforts to advance our understanding and management of these conditions. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles that are the primary cause of dementia in older individuals. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD dementia is crucial for effective intervention and treatment but has proven challenging to accomplish. Although testing for AD brain pathology with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) has been available for over 2 decades, most patients never underwent this testing because of inaccessibility, high out-of-pocket costs, perceived risks, and the lack of AD-specific treatments. However, in recent years, rapid progress has been made in developing blood biomarkers for AD/ADRD. Consequently, blood biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for non-invasive and cost-effective diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of AD progression. This review presents the evolving landscape of blood biomarkers in AD/ADRD and explores their potential applications in clinical practice for early detection, prognosis, and therapeutic interventions. It covers recent advances in blood biomarkers, including amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, tau protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). It also discusses their diagnostic and prognostic utility while addressing associated challenges and limitations.

Accurate and highly sensitive detection of Alzheimer's disease-related extracellular vesicles via förster resonance energy transfer.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and poses a huge challenge to global healthcare.

Single-extracellular vesicle (EV) analyses validate the use of L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM) as a reliable biomarker of neuron-derived EVs.,"Isolation of neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) with L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM)-specific antibodies has been widely used to identify blood biomarkers of CNS disorders. However, full methodological validation requires demonstration of L1CAM in individual NDEVs and lower levels or absence of L1CAM in individual EVs from other cells. Here, we used multiple single-EV techniques to establish the neuronal origin and determine the abundance of L1CAM-positive EVs in human blood. L1CAM epitopes of the ectodomain are shown to be co-expressed on single-EVs with the neuronal proteins β-III-tubulin, GAP43, and VAMP2, the levels of which increase in parallel with the enrichment of L1CAM-positive EVs. Levels of L1CAM-positive EVs carrying the neuronal proteins VAMP2 and β-III-tubulin range from 30% to 63%, in contrast to 0.8%-3.9% of L1CAM-negative EVs. Plasma fluid-phase L1CAM does not bind to single-EVs.

The observed protein dynamics in a solid tissue or a fluid is the net result of not only protein synthesis and degradation but also transport across biological compartments. We report an accurate 3-biological compartment model able to simultaneously account for the protein dynamics observed in blood plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) including a hidden central nervous system (CNS) compartment. We successfully applied this model to 69 proteins of a single individual displaying similar or very different dynamics in plasma and CSF. This study puts a strong emphasis on the methods and tools needed to develop this type of model.

"A machine learning-based prediction of tau load and distribution in Alzheimer's disease using plasma, MRI and clinical variables.","Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a reliable neuroimaging technique for assessing regional load of tau pathology in the brain, commonly used in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and clinical trials. However, its routine clinical use is limited by cost and accessibility barriers. Here we explore using machine learning (ML) models to predict clinically useful tau-PET outcomes from low-cost and non-invasive features, e.g., basic clinical variables, plasma biomarkers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results demonstrated that models including plasma biomarkers yielded highly accurate predictions of tau-PET burden (best model: R-squared=0.66-0.68), with especially high contribution from plasma P-tau217. In contrast, MRI variables stood out as best predictors (best model: R-squared=0.28-0.42) of asymmetric tau load between the two hemispheres (an example of clinically relevant spatial information). The models showed high generalizability to external test cohorts with data collected at multiple sites. Based on these results, we also propose a proof-of-concept two-step classification workflow, demonstrating how the ML models can be translated to a clinical setting.

To further evaluate the suitability of the formulation for future clinical application, we investigated the safety, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetic profile of aAβ-BTRA-NC in a transgenic TgCRND8 mouse AD model, wild type (WT) littermate, and CD-1 mice. Dose-ascending studies demonstrated that aAβ-BTRA-NC was well-tolerated by the animals up to 300 μmol Mn/kg body weight [b.w.], 3 times the efficacious dose for early AD detection without apparent adverse effects; Histopathological, hematological, and biochemical analyses indicated that a single dose of aAβ-BTRA-NC did not cause any toxicity in major organs. Immunotoxicity data showed that aAβ-BTRA-NC was safer than commercially available gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents at an equivalent dose of 100 μmol/kg b.w. of metal ions. Intravenously administered aAβ-BTRA-NC was taken up by main organs with the order of liver, kidneys, intestines, spleen, followed by other organs, and cleared after one day to one week post injection. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the plasma concentration profile of aAβ-BTRA-NC followed a 2-compartmental model with faster clearance in the AD mice than in the WT mice. The results suggest that aAβ-BTRA-NC exhibits a strong safety profile as a nanotheranostic agent which warrants more robust preclinical development for future clinical applications.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; biosafety; hybrid manganese dioxide nanoparticles; mouse model; theragnostic,,"Li, LY; Park, E; He, C; Abbasi, AZ; Henderson, JT; Fraser, PE; Uetrecht, JP; Rauth, AM; Wu, XY"

Blood-based therapies to combat neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegeneration, known as the progressive loss of neurons in terms of their structure and function, is the principal pathophysiological change found in the majority of brain-related disorders. Ageing has been considered the most well-established risk factor in most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is currently no effective treatment or cure for these diseases; the approved therapeutic options to date are only for palliative care. Ageing and neurodegenerative diseases are closely intertwined; reversing the aspects of brain ageing could theoretically mitigate age-related neurodegeneration. Ever since the regenerative properties of young blood on aged tissues came to light, substantial efforts have been focused on identifying and characterizing the circulating factors in the young and old systemic milieu that may attenuate or accentuate brain ageing and neurodegeneration. Later studies discovered the superiority of old plasma dilution in tissue rejuvenation, which is achieved through a molecular reset of the systemic proteome. These findings supported the use of therapeutic blood exchange for the treatment of degenerative diseases in older individuals. The first objective of this article is to explore the rejuvenating properties of blood-based therapies in the ageing brains and their therapeutic effects on AD. Then, we also look into the clinical applications, various limitations, and challenges associated with blood-based therapies for AD patients.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Intravenous immunoglobulin; Neurodegenerative disease; Parabiosis; Therapeutic plasma exchange; Young blood plasma,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Aging; Animals; Brain; Alzheimer Disease,"Lee, JY; Lim, MCX; Koh, RY; Tsen, MT; Chye, SM"

Distinctive contribution of two additional residues in protein aggregation of Aβ42 and Aβ40 isoforms.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that self-assemble to protein aggregates, incurring cell malfunction and cytotoxicity. While Aβ has been known to regulate multiple physiological functions, such as enhancing synaptic functions, aiding in the recovery of the blood-brain barrier/brain injury, and exhibiting tumor suppression/antimicrobial activities, the hydrophobicity of the primary structure promotes pathological aggregations that are closely associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ proteins consist of multiple isoforms with 37-43 amino acid residues that are produced by the cleavage of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP). The hydrolytic products of APP are secreted to the extracellular regions of neuronal cells. Aβ 1-42 (Aβ42) and Aβ 1-40 (Aβ40) are dominant isoforms whose significance in AD pathogenesis has been highlighted in numerous studies to understand the molecular mechanism and develop AD diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we focus on the differences between Aβ42 and Aβ40 in the molecular mechanism of amyloid aggregations mediated by the two additional residues (Ile41 and Ala42) of Aβ42. The current comprehension of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in AD progression is outlined, together with the structural features of Aβ42/Aβ40 amyloid fibrils, and the aggregation mechanisms of Aβ42/Aβ40. Furthermore, the impact of the heterogeneous distribution of Aβ isoforms during amyloid aggregations is discussed in the system mimicking the coexistence of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma.

Neuraminidase 1 regulates the cellular state of microglia by modulating the sialylation of Trem2.,"Neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) cleaves terminal sialic acids from sialoglycoproteins in endolysosomes and at the plasma membrane. As such, Neu1 regulates immune cells, primarily those of the monocytic lineage. Here we examined how Neu1 influences microglia by modulating the sialylation of full-length Trem2 (Trem2-FL), a multifunctional receptor that regulates microglial survival, phagocytosis, and cytokine production. When Neu1 was deficient/downregulated, Trem2-FL remained sialylated, accumulated intracellularly, and was excessively cleaved into a C-terminal fragment (Trem2-CTF) and an extracellular soluble domain (sTrem2), enhancing their signaling capacities. Sialylated Trem2-FL (Sia-Trem2-FL) did not hinder Trem2-FL-DAP12-Syk complex assembly but impaired signal transduction through Syk, ultimately abolishing Trem2-dependent phagocytosis. Concurrently, Trem2-CTF-DAP12 complexes dampened NFκB signaling, while sTrem2 propagated Akt-dependent cell survival and NFAT1-mediated production of TNFα and CCL3. Because Neu1 and Trem2 are implicated in neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and sialidosis, modulating Neu1 activity represents a therapeutic approach to broadly regulate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.",2024,,,"Fremuth, LE; Hu, H; van de Vlekkert, D; Annunziata, I; Weesner, JA; Gomero, E; d'Azzo, A"

"Quercetin ameliorates cognitive deficit, expression of amyloid precursor gene, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in an experimental models of Alzheimer's disease in Wistar rats.","Chronic stress (CS) is critically involved in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis resulting in cognitive disturbance. Also, amyloid precursor protein (APP) related gens, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and stress increases AD-related pathogenesis through increasing APP, all are important players in the development of AD. Herein, we explore the possible neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effect of quercetin (QUER) on cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine (SCOP) in stressed rats. Stress induction was performed by exposed of rats to 2-h chronic restraint stress for 10 days. Then rats were supplemented with QUER (25 mg/kg/day oral gavage, for 1 month). Ratswere submitted to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of SCOP (1 mg/kg) during the final 9 days of QUER supplementation to induce dementia like condition. Following the interventions, behavioral tests [elevated plus maze (EPM) and novel object recognition memory (NORM)] was examined to analysis the cognitive functions. Meanwhile, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of brain were used for gene expression and biochemical studies. Also, the plasma corticosterone (CORT) level was measured. We established that administration of QUER ameliorated the SCOP-related memory impairment. Also, QUER decreased stress related anxiety like behaviors in the EPM. QUER also altered the interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in both PFC and hippocampus of SCOP treated rats in stress and non-stress conditions. We found that QUER increased APP and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) mRNA expression in both non-stress and stressed rats. Also, our findings imply that QUER suppress the effect of SCOP on cognitive functions. Moreover, decreased APP mRNA expression in the hippocampus were observed following pretreatment of rats with QUER in both stress and non-stress groups. Given that decreased amyloid beta (Aβ) expression in the hippocampus of stressed rats, it can be proposed that elevations in APP mRNA expression by QUER activates non-amyloidogenic pathways leading to reduction in Aβ levels. However, our findings indicate that QUER can be a therapeutic candidate, which exerts an anti-amnesic property against SCOP-induced memory decline. On the other hand, prior QUER administration in stress condition could be a promising approach against AD prevention.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid precursor gens; Cognition; Neuroprotective; Scopolamine; Stress,"Animals; Quercetin; Alzheimer Disease; Rats, Wistar; Male; Disease Models, Animal; Rats; Cytokines; Hippocampus; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Stress, Psychological; Cognitive Dysfunction; Scopolamine; Neuroprotective Agents; Corticosterone; Prefrontal Cortex; Cognition","Safarzadeh, E; Ataei, S; Akbari, M; Abolhasani, R; Baziar, M; Asghariazar, V; Dadkhah, M"

Nanoinjection: A Platform for Innovation in Ex Vivo Cell Engineering.,"ConspectusIn human cells, intracellular access and therapeutic cargo transport, including gene-editing tools (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 and transposons), nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, mRNA, and siRNA), peptides, and proteins (e.g., enzymes and antibodies), are tightly constrained to ensure healthy cell function and behavior. This principle is exemplified in the delivery mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells for ex-vivo immunotherapy. In particular, the clinical success of CAR-T cells has established a new standard of care by curing previously incurable blood cancers. The approach involves the delivery, typically via the use of electroporation (EP) and lentivirus, of therapeutic CAR genes into a patient's own T cells, which are then engineered to express CARs that target and combat their blood cancer. But the key difficulty lies in genetically manipulating these cells without causing irreversible damage or loss of function─all the while minimizing complexities of manufacturing, safety concerns, and costs, and ensuring the efficacy of the final CAR-T cell product.Nanoinjection─the process of intracellular delivery using nanoneedles (NNs)─is an emerging physical delivery route that efficiently negotiates the plasma membrane of many cell types, including primary human T cells. It occurs with minimal perturbation, invasiveness, and toxicity, with high efficiency and throughput at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Nanoinjection promises greatly improved delivery of a broad range of therapeutic cargos with little or no damage to those cargos. A nanoinjection platform allows these cargos to function in the intracellular space as desired. The adaptability of nanoinjection platforms is now bringing major advantages in immunomodulation, mechanotransduction, sampling of cell states (nanobiopsy), controlled intracellular interrogation, and the primary focus of this account─intracellular delivery and its applications in ex vivo cell engineering.Mechanical nanoinjection typically exerts direct mechanical force on the cell membrane, offering a straightforward route to improve membrane perturbation by the NNs and subsequent transport of genetic cargo into targeted cell type (adherent or suspension cells). By contrast, electroactive nanoinjection is controlled by coupling NNs with an electric field─a new route for activating electroporation (EP) at the nanoscale─allowing a dramatic reduction of the applied voltage to a cell and so minimizing post-EP damage to cells and cargo, and overcoming many of the limitations of conventional bulk EP. Nanoinjection transcends mere technique; it is an approach to cell engineering ex vivo, offering the potential to endow cells with new, powerful features such as generating chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells for future CAR-T cell technologies.We first discuss the manufacturing of NN devices (Section 2), then delve into nanoinjection-mediated cell engineering (Section 3), nanoinjection mechanisms and interfacing methodologies (Section 4), and emerging applications in using nanoinjection to create functional CAR-T cells (Section 5).",2024,,"Humans; Cell Engineering; Receptors, Chimeric Antigen; Nanotechnology; T-Lymphocytes; Electroporation; Injections","Chen, Y; Shokouhi, AR; Voelcker, NH; Elnathan, R"
[Blood biomarkers open a window to brain pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease].,"Technical developments have paved the way for the development of ultrasensitive analytical methods that allow for precise quantification of brain-specific proteins in blood samples. Plasma levels of amyloid β, specifically the Aβ42/40 ratio, are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and show concordance with brain amyloidosis assessed by PET, but the overlap with normal elderly may be too large for reliable use in clinical applications. Plasma phosphorylated tau (P-tau), especially a variant called P-tau217, is markedly increased in the early symptomatic stages of AD but remains normal in other neurodegenerative disorders. Total tau (T-tau) is measurable in blood and shows most promise as a biomarker for acute neuronal injury (e.g. acute traumatic or hypoxic brain injury), where T-tau shows a fast and dramatic increase but does not work well as an AD biomarker due to contributions to blood levels from peripheral tissues. Instead, a novel method for tau protein produced only in the CNS called brain-derived tau (BD-tau) shows promise as a biomarker for AD-type neurodegeneration. Neurofilament light (NFL) levels in blood correlate tightly with levels in CSF and reflect axonal injury irrespective of the underlying cause. Increased blood NFL concentration is found in several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, but even more so in disorders such as motor neuron disease and frontotemporal dementia. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed with activation of astrocytes, and is mildly increased in AD, but is also very high also in acute brain disorders. These blood tests show promise as tools to identify AD pathophysiology in the first assessment of patients with early cognitive symptoms, also in primary care, to guide clinical management and possible admission to the specialist clinic. A two-step model will result in a very high accuracy to either predict or exclude brain amyloidosis of the Alzheimer type.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Neurofilament Proteins; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,"Blennow, K; Hansson, O"
Oxygen-enriching triphase platform for reliable sensing of femtomolar Alzheimer's neurofilament lights.,"Accurate quantification of neurofilament lights (NfLs), a prognostic blood biomarker, is highly required to predict neurodegeneration in the presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report self-oxygen-enriching coral structures with triphase interfaces for the label-free photocathodic detection of NfLs in blood plasma with femtomolar sensitivities and high reliability. In conventional photocathodic immunoassays, the poor solubility and sluggish diffusion rate of the dissolved oxygen serving as electron acceptors have necessitated the incorporation of additional electron acceptors or aeration procedures. To address the challenge, we designed the coral-like copper bismuth oxides (CBO) with robust solid-liquid-air contact boundaries that enrich the interfacial oxygen levels without an external aeration source. By optimally assembling the perfluorododecyltrichlorosilane (FTCS) and platinum (Pt) co-catalysts into the silver-doped CBO (Ag:CBO), the stable solid-liquid-air contact boundaries were formed within the sensor interfaces, which allowed for the abundant supply of air phase oxygen through an air pocket connected to the atmosphere. The Pt/FTCS-Ag:CBO exhibited the stable background signals independent of the dissolved oxygen fluctuations and amplified photocurrent signals by 1.76-fold, which were attributed to the elevated interfacial oxygen levels and 11.15 times-lowered mass transport resistance. Under the illumination of white light-emitting diode, the oxygen-enriching photocathodic sensor composed of Pt/FTCS-Ag:CBO conjugated with NfLs-specific antibodies precisely quantified the NfLs in plasma with a low coefficient of variation (≤2.97%), a high degree of recovery (>97.0%), and a limit of detection of 40.38 fg/mL, which was 140 times lower than the typical photocathodic sensor with diphase interfaces.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Femtomolar detection; High reliability; Neurofilament light; Oxygen-enrichment; Triphase system,Humans; Biosensing Techniques; Alzheimer Disease; Bismuth; Platinum; Oxygen; Copper; Limit of Detection; Biomarkers; Silver; Electrochemical Techniques; Immunoassay; Neurofilament Proteins; Animals,"Song, Y; Kim, H; Lee, J; Kim, K"

Effect of blood collection tube containing protease inhibitors on the pre-analytical stability of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers.,"The reliability of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be compromised by protease-induced degradation. This can limit the feasibility of conducting plasma biomarker studies in environments that lack the capacity for immediate processing and appropriate storage of blood samples. We hypothesized that blood collection tube supplementation with protease inhibitors can improve the stability of plasma biomarkers at room temperatures (RT). In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of blood biomarker stability in traditional ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes versus BD™ P100 collection tubes, the latter being coated with a protease inhibitor cocktail. The stability of six plasma AD biomarkers was evaluated over time under RT conditions. We evaluated three experimental approaches. In Approach 1, pooled plasma samples underwent storage at RT for up to 96 h. In Approach 2, plasma samples isolated upfront from whole blood collected into EDTA or P100 tubes were stored at RT for 0 h or 24 h before biomarker measurements. In Approach 3, whole blood samples were collected into paired EDTA and P100 tubes, followed by storage at RT for 0 h or 24 h before isolating the plasma for analyses. Biomarkers were measured with Single Molecule Array (Simoa) and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays. Both the IP-MS and Simoa methods revealed that the use of P100 tubes significantly improves the stability of Aβ42 and Aβ40 across all approaches. However, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio levels were significantly stabilized only in the IP-MS assay in Approach 3. No significant differences were observed in the levels of plasma p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL for samples collected using either tube type in any of the approaches. Supplementation of blood collection tubes with protease inhibitors could reduce the protease-induced degradation of plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40, and the Aβ42/40 ratio for the IP-MS assay. These findings have crucial implications for preanalytical procedures, particularly in resource-limited settings.",2024,Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; blood biomarkers; delayed centrifugation; preanalytical handling; protease inhibition; proteolytic processing,,"Chen, Y; Zeng, X; Diaz, JL; Sehrawat, A; Lafferty, TK; Boslett, JJ; Klunk, WE; Pascoal, TA; Villemagne, VL; Cohen, AD; Lopez, OI; Yates, NA; Karikari, TK"

A Novel RP-UHPLC-MS/MS Approach for the Determination of Tryptophan Metabolites Derivatized with 2-Bromo-4'-Nitroacetophenone.,"Many biologically active metabolites of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan (Trp) are associated with different neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disorders. Precise and reliable methods for their determination are needed. Variability in their physicochemical properties makes the analytical process challenging. In this case, chemical modification of analyte derivatization could come into play. Here, we introduce a novel fast reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UHPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method for the determination of Trp and its ten metabolites in human plasma samples after derivatization with 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone (BNAP). The derivatization procedure was optimized in terms of incubation time, temperature, concentration, and volume of the derivatization reagent. Method development comprises a choice of a suitable stationary phase, mobile phase composition, and gradient elution optimization. The developed method was validated according to the ICH guidelines. Results of all validation parameters were within the acceptance criteria of the guideline, i.e., intra- and inter-day precision (expressed as relative standard deviation; RSD) were in the range of 0.5-8.2% and 2.3-7.4%, accuracy was in the range of 93.3-109.7% and 94.7-110.1%, limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.15-9.43 ng/mL, coefficients of determination (R2) were higher than 0.9906, and carryovers were, in all cases, less than 8.8%. The practicability of the method was evaluated using the blue applicability grade index (BAGI) with a score of 65. Finally, the developed method was used for the analysis of Alzheimer's disease and healthy control plasma to prove its applicability. Statistical analysis revealed significant changes in picolinic acid (PA), anthranilic acid (AA), 5 hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-OH IAA), and quinolinic acid (QA) concentration levels. This could serve as the basis for future studies that will be conducted with a large cohort of patients.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; derivatization; liquid chromatography; tryptophan metabolites,,"Jankech, T; Gerhardtova, I; Majerova, P; Piestansky, J; Fialova, L; Jampilek, J; Kovac, A"

"Comparative Analysis of Posiphen Pharmacokinetics across Different Species-Similar Absorption and Metabolism in Mouse, Rat, Dog and Human.","Posiphen is a small molecule that exhibits neuroprotective properties by targeting multiple neurotoxic proteins involved in axonal transport, synaptic transmission, neuroinflammation, and cell death. Its broad-spectrum effects make it a promising candidate for treating neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Despite extensive investigation with animal models and human subjects, a comprehensive comparative analysis of Posiphen's pharmacokinetics across studies remains elusive. Here, we address this gap by examining the metabolic profiles of Posiphen and its breakdown into two primary metabolites-N1 and N8-across species by measuring their concentrations in plasma, brain, and CSF using the LC-MS/MS method. While all three compounds effectively inhibit neurotoxic proteins, the N1 metabolite is associated with adverse effects. Our findings reveal the species-specific behavior of Posiphen, with both Posiphen and N8 being predominant in various species, while N1 remains a minor constituent, supporting the drug's safety. Moreover, in plasma, Posiphen consistently showed fast clearance of all metabolites within 8 h in animal models and in human subjects, whereas in CSF or brain, the compound has an extended half-life of over 12 h. Combining all our human data and analyzing them by population pharmacokinetics showed that there are no differences between healthy volunteers, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's patients. It also showed that Posiphen is absorbed and metabolized in a similar fashion across all animal species and human groups tested. These observations have critical implications for understanding the drug's safety, therapeutic effect, and clinical translation.",2024,metabolism; neurodegeneration; neurodegenerative diseases; pharmacokinetics; posiphen; species comparison,"Humans; Animals; Rats; Dogs; Mice; Male; Species Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Brain; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Neuroprotective Agents; Female","Maccecchini, ML; Mould, DR"

[Human tau N-terminal domain-specific monoclonal antibodies: screening and application in blood detection].,"The antibodies to the microtubule-associated protein tau play a role in basic and clinical studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. With the recombinant human tau441 as the immunogen, the hybridoma cell strains secreting the anti-human tau N-terminal domain (NTD-tau) monoclonal antibodies were generated by cell fusion and screened by limiting dilution. The purified monoclonal antibodies were obtained by inducing the mouse ascites and affinity chromatography. The sensitivity and specificity of the monoclonal antibodies were examined by indirect ELISA and Western blotting, respectively. A double antibody sandwich ELISA method for detecting human tau protein was established and optimized. The results showed that the positive cloning rate of hybridoma cells was 83.6%. A stable cell line producing ZD8F7 antibodies was established, and the antibody titer in the supernatant of the cell line was 1:16 000. The antibody titer in the ascitic fluid was higher than 1:256 000; and the titer of purified ZD8F7 monoclonal antibodies was higher than 1:128 000. The epitope analysis showed that the ZD8F7 antibody recognized tau21-37 amino acid in the N-terminal domain. The Western blotting results showed that the ZD8F7 antibody recognized the recombinant human tau protein of 50-70 kDa and the human tau protein of 50 kDa in the brain tissue of transgenic AD model mice (APP/PS1/tau). With ZD8F7 as a capture antibody, a quantitative detection method for human tau protein was established, which showed a linear range of 7.8-500.0 pg/mL and could identify human tau protein in the brain tissue of AD transgenic mice and human plasma but not recognize the mouse tau protein.

Considerations for biomarker strategies in clinical trials investigating tau-targeting therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.,"The use of biomarker-led clinical trial designs has been transformative for investigating amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The designs have ensured the correct selection of patients on these trials, supported target engagement and have been used to support claims of disease modification and clinical efficacy. Ultimately, this has recently led to approval of disease-modifying, amyloid-targeting therapies for AD; something that should be noted for clinical trials investigating tau-targeting therapies for AD. There is a clear overlap of the purpose of biomarker use at each stage of clinical development between amyloid-targeting and tau-targeting clinical trials. However, there are differences within the potential context of use and interpretation for some biomarkers in particular measurements of amyloid and utility of soluble, phosphorylated tau biomarkers. Given the complexities of tau in health and disease, it is paramount that therapies target disease-relevant tau and, in parallel, appropriate assays of target engagement are developed.

Altering plasma lipids and liver enzyme activities via hippocampal injections of hen Lysozyme amyloid aggregates in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model: Insights into the therapeutic role of Bis (Indolyl) phenylmethane.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent form of dementia in the elderly. There is currently no effective treatment available for this disease. Diagnosis of AD typically relies on clinical manifestations and specific biomarkers. The present study investigated the impact of inducing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mice through the injection of lysozyme amyloids formed in the presence or absence of Bis (Indolyl) phenylmethane (BIPM) on alterations in plasma lipid profiles and liver enzyme activities. 24 adult Wistar rats were divided into control, Scopolamine, Lysozyme, BIPM groups and the blood samples were obtained from the groups for biochemical analysis. The findings of the study revealed significant changes in the plasma lipid profiles and liver enzyme markers of the Lysozyme group compared to the control group. The Lysozyme group exhibited elevated triglycerides (n = 6, P < 0.02) and LDL levels (n = 6, P < 0.02), reduced HDL (n = 6, P < 0.05) and cholesterol levels (n = 6, P < 0.02), and altered serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) level (n = 6, P < 0.05) compared to controls. While the level of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) did not change significantly compared to the control. BIPM groups showed no significant changes in lipid or enzyme levels compared to controls. Overall, our research has shown that BIPM has the ability to modify the structure of HEWL aggregates, thereby improving the detrimental effects associated with AD caused by these aggregates. Analyzing lipid profiles and liver enzyme markers presents a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic approaches. These alterations observed in the plasma may potentially serve as candidate biomarkers for diagnosing this disease.",2024,Amyloid inhibition; Bis (Indolyl) phenylmethane; Lipid profile; Liver enzymes; Lysozyme aggregates,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Liver; Muramidase; Hippocampus; Rats, Wistar; Lipids; Disease Models, Animal; Mice; Male; Indoles; Amyloid; Rats","Fazelinejad, H; Zahedi, E; Khadivi, M"

Exploring Curcumin-Loaded Lipid-Based Nanomedicine as Efficient Targeted Therapy for Alzheimer's Diseases.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition currently with 47 million people suffering from it globally. AD might have many reasons such as genetic issues, environmental factors, and Aβ accumulation, which is the biomarker of the disease. Since the primary reason is unknown, there is no targeted treatment at the moment, but ongoing research aims to slow its progression by managing amyloid-beta peptide production rather than symptomatic improvement. Since phytochemicals have been demonstrated to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, they may target multiple pathological factors and can reduce the risk of the disease. Curcumin, as a phytochemical found in turmeric known for its antioxidant, free radical scavenging properties, and as an antiamyloid in treating AD, has come under investigation. Although its low bioavailability limits its efficacy, a prominent drug delivery system (DDS) is desired to overcome it. Hence, the potency of lipid-based nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin (LNPs-CUR) is considered in this study as a promising DDS. In vivo studies in animal models indicate LNPs-CUR effectively slow amyloid plaque formation, leading to cognitive enhancement and reduced toxicity compared to free CUR. However, a deeper understanding of CUR's pharmacokinetics and safety profile is crucial before LNPs-CUR can be considered as a medicine. Future investigations may explore the combination of NPs with other therapeutic agents to increase their efficacy in AD cases. This review provides the current position of CUR in the AD therapy paradigm, the DDS suggestions for CUR, and the previous research from the point of analytical view focused on the advantages and challenges.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Amyloid Plaque; Curcumin; Drug Delivery Systems (DDS); Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs); Neuroprotection C,Curcumin; Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Nanomedicine; Animals; Lipids; Particle Size; Biocompatible Materials; Nanoparticles; Materials Testing; Drug Delivery Systems; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Far, BF; Safaei, M; Pourmolaei, A; Adibamini, S; Shirdel, S; Shirdel, S; Emadi, R; Kaushik, AK"

Alzheimer's disease early screening and staged detection with plasma proteome using machine learning and convolutional neural network.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disease, precipitating cognitive impairment and even memory loss. Amyloid biomarkers have been extensively used in the diagnosis of AD. However, amyloid proteins offer limited information about the disease process and accurate diagnosis depends on the presence of a substantial accumulation of amyloid deposition which significantly impedes the early screening of AD. In this study, we have combined plasma proteomics with an ensemble learning model (CatBoost) to develop a cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic method for AD. A longitudinal panel has been identified that can serve as reliable biomarkers across the entire progression of AD. Simultaneously, we have developed a neural network algorithm that utilizes plasma proteins to detect stages of Alzheimer's disease. Based on the developed longitudinal panel, the CatBoost model achieved an area under the operating curve of at least 0.90 in distinguishing mild cognitive impairment from cognitively normal. The neural network model was utilized for the detection of three stages of AD, and the results demonstrated that the neural network model exhibited an accuracy as high as 0.83, surpassing that of the traditional machine learning model.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; early screening; longitudinal panel; neural network; plasma proteomics,,"Qin, H; Shi, X; Zhu, Y; Ma, J; Deng, X; Wang, L"

Integrating the patient's voice into the research agenda for treatment of chemosensory disorders.,"World-wide some 658 million people were infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and millions suffer from chemosensory impairment associated with long COVID. Current treatments for taste and smell disorders are limited. Involving patients has the potential to catalyze the dynamic exchange and development of new ideas and approaches to facilitate biomedical research and therapeutics. We assessed patients' perceptions of the efficacy of treatments for chemosensory impairment using an online questionnaire completed by 5,815 people in the US Logistic regression determined variables predictive of reported treatment efficacy for patients aged 18 to 24, 25 to 39, 40 to 60, and 60+ yrs. who were treated with nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, smell training, theophylline, platelet-rich plasma, and Omega 3. The most consistent predictor was age, with the majority of those 40 to 60 and 60+ reporting that nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, and smell training were only slightly effective or not effective at all. Many of these treatment strategies target regeneration and immune response, processes compromised by age. Only those under 40 reported more than slight efficacy of steroids or smell training. Findings emphasize the need to include patients of all ages in clinical trials. Older adults with olfactory impairment are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We speculate that olfactory impairment associated with long COVID introduces the potential for a significant rise in AD.

Future perspective and clinical applicability of the combined use of plasma phosphorylated tau 181 and neurofilament light chain in Subjective Cognitive Decline and Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"We aimed to assess diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau181 and NfL separately and in combination in discriminating Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients carrying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology from non-carriers; to propose a flowchart for the interpretation of the results of plasma p-tau181 and NfL. We included 43 SCD, 41 MCI and 21 AD-demented (AD-d) patients, who underwent plasma p-tau181 and NfL analysis. Twenty-eight SCD, 41 MCI and 21 AD-d patients underwent CSF biomarkers analysis (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-42/1-40, p-tau, t-tau) and were classified as carriers of AD pathology (AP+) it they were A+/T+ , or non-carriers (AP-) when they were A-, A+/T-/N-, or A+/T-/N+ according to the A/T(N) system. Plasma p-tau181 and NfL separately showed a good accuracy (AUC = 0.88), while the combined model (NfL + p-tau181) showed an excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.92) in discriminating AP+ from AP- patients. Plasma p-tau181 and NfL results were moderately concordant (Coehn's k = 0.50, p < 0.001). Based on a logistic regression model, we estimated the risk of AD pathology considering the two biomarkers: 10.91% if both p-tau181 and NfL were negative; 41.10 and 76.49% if only one biomarker was positive (respectively p-tau18 and NfL); 94.88% if both p-tau181 and NfL were positive.

A Review of Recent Advances in the Management of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition and a form of dementia encountered in medical practice. Despite many proposed and attempted treatments, this disease remains a major puzzle in the public health systems worldwide. The initial part of this article provides an overview and illustration of the primary mechanisms responsible for neuronal damage in AD. Subsequently, it offers a critical evaluation of the most noteworthy studies on pharmacological therapy for AD and outlines recent advancements and novel approaches to managing this condition. Main properties, categorization, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) status, mechanisms of action, benefits, and common side effects of the classical and the most recently proposed pharmacological treatments for AD are described. The conventional pharmacological agents revised comprise cholinesterase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and other therapies, such as memantine, valproic acid, and rosiglitazone. The innovative reviewed pharmacological agents comprise the monoclonal antibodies: donanemab, gantenerumab, solanezumab, bapineuzumab, crenezumab, and semorinemab. Nutritional supplements such as alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and caprylidene are also revised. Tau and amyloid-targeting treatments include methylthioninium moiety (MT), leuco-methylthioninium bis (LMTM), an oxidized form of MT, and tramiprosate, which inhibits the beta-amyloid (Aβ) monomer aggregation into toxic oligomers. Antidiabetic and anti-neuroinflammation drugs recently proposed for AD treatment are discussed. The antidiabetic drugs include NE3107, an anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizer, and the diabetes mainstream drug metformin. The anti-neuroinflammatory AD therapies include the use of sodium oligomannate (GV-971), infusions with intravenous immunoglobulin aiming to decrease plasma levels of the constituents of Aβ plaques, and masitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that impacts mast and microglia cells. Additional anti-inflammatory agents being currently tested in phase-2 clinical trials, such as atomoxetine (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), losartan (angiotensin 2 receptor agonist), genistein (anti-inflammatory isoflavone neuroprotective agent), trans-resveratrol (polyphenol antioxidant plant estrogen), and benfotiamine (synthetic thiamine precursor), were reviewed. Lastly, drugs targeting Alzheimer's-associated symptoms, such as brexpiprazole (serotonin dopamine activity modulator) and suvorexant (orexin receptor antagonist), respectively, used for agitation and insomnia in AD patients, are reviewed. As experimental investigations and clinical research progress, there is a possibility that a combination of newly tested medications and traditional ones may emerge as a promising treatment option for AD in the future.",2024,amyloid plaques; beta-amyloid peptide; cholinesterase inhibitors; dementia; orexin,,"Thangwaritorn, S; Lee, C; Metchikoff, E; Razdan, V; Ghafary, S; Rivera, D; Pinto, A; Pemminati, S"

"Association of dietary and nutritional factors with cognitive decline, dementia, and depressive symptomatology in older individuals according to a neurogenesis-centred biological susceptibility to brain ageing.","Hippocampal neurogenesis (HN) occurs throughout the life course and is important for memory and mood. Declining with age, HN plays a pivotal role in cognitive decline (CD), dementia, and late-life depression, such that altered HN could represent a neurobiological susceptibility to these conditions. Pertinently, dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean diet) and/or individual nutrients (e.g., vitamin D, omega 3) can modify HN, but also modify risk for CD, dementia, and depression. Therefore, the interaction between diet/nutrition and HN may alter risk trajectories for these ageing-related brain conditions. Using a subsample (n = 371) of the Three-City cohort-where older adults provided information on diet and blood biobanking at baseline and were assessed for CD, dementia, and depressive symptomatology across 12 years-we tested for interactions between food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional biomarker concentrations and neurogenesis-centred susceptibility status (defined by baseline readouts of hippocampal progenitor cell integrity, cell death, and differentiation) on CD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular and other dementias (VoD), and depressive symptomatology, using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models.

Amyloid-β and Phosphorylated Tau are the Key Biomarkers and Predictors of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a age-related neurodegenerative disease and is a major public health concern both in Texas, US and Worldwide. This neurodegenerative disease is mainly characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) accumulation in the brains of patients with AD and increasing evidence suggests that these are key biomarkers in AD. Both Aβ and p-tau can be detected through various imaging techniques (such as positron emission tomography, PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The presence of these biomarkers in individuals, who are asymptomatic or have mild cognitive impairment can indicate an increased risk of developing AD in the future. Furthermore, the combination of Aβ and p-tau biomarkers is often used for more accurate diagnosis and prediction of AD progression. Along with AD being a neurodegenerative disease, it is associated with other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and diabetes because studies have shown that these comorbid conditions make people more vulnerable to AD. In the first part of this review, we discuss that biofluid-based biomarkers such as Aβ, p-Tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Aβ & p-Tau in plasma could be used as an alternative sensitive technique to diagnose AD.

Assessment of the Correlation and Diagnostic Accuracy between Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers: A Comparison of the Lumipulse and Simoa Platforms.,"We compared the clinical and analytical performance of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers measured using the single-molecule array (Simoa) and Lumipulse platforms. We quantified the plasma levels of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), Aβ40, phosphorylated tau (Ptau181), and total tau biomarkers in 81 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 30 with AD, and 16 with non-AD dementia. We found a strong correlation between the Simoa and Lumipulse methods. Concerning the clinical diagnosis, Simoa Ptau181/Aβ42 (AUC 0.739, 95% CI 0.592-0.887) and Lumipulse Aβ42 and Ptau181/Aβ42 (AUC 0.735, 95% CI 0.589-0.882 and AUC 0.733, 95% CI 0.567-0.900) had the highest discriminating power. However, their power was significantly lower than that of CSF Aβ42/Aβ40, as measured by Lumipulse (AUC 0.879, 95% CI 0.766-0.992). Simoa Ptau181 and Lumipulse Ptau181/Aβ42 were the markers most consistent with the CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 status (AUC 0.801, 95% CI 0.712-0.890 vs. AUC 0.870, 95% CI 0.806-0.934, respectively) at the ≥2.127 and ≥0.084 cut-offs, respectively.

Prevention of amyloid β fibril deposition on the synaptic membrane in the precuneus by ganglioside nanocluster-targeting inhibitors.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition, is one of the most common causes of dementia. Senile plaques, a hallmark of AD, are formed by the accumulation of amyloid β protein (Aβ), which starts to aggregate before the onset of the disease. Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, play a key role in the formation of toxic Aβ aggregates. In membrane rafts, ganglioside-bound complexes (GAβ) act as nuclei for Aβ assembly, suggesting that GAβ is a promising target for AD therapy. The formation of GAβ-induced Aβ assemblies has been evaluated using reconstituted planar lipid membranes composed of synaptosomal plasma membrane (SPM) lipids extracted from human and mouse brains. Although the effects of gangliosides on Aβ accumulation in the precuneus have been established, effects on Aβ fibrils have not been determined.

High plasma homocysteine levels predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.,"High levels of blood homocysteine (HCy), a well-known cardiovascular risk factor and promoter of oxidative stress, have been associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia. Nonetheless, contrasting data are still present on its involvement in the progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to overt dementia. In this study we aimed to observe whether blood HCy level are associated with the evolution from MCI, divided into amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI), to dementia. Blood HCy was measured in 311 MCI subjects (aMCI: 64%, naMCI: 36%) followed-up for a median of 33 months (range 10-155 months). At follow-up, 137 individuals converted to dementia (naMCI, n = 34; aMCI, n = 103). Based on HCy distribution, subjects in the highest tertile had a greater risk to convert to dementia compared to tertile I (Hazard Ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.25 (1.05-4.86); p = 0.04). aMCI subjects did not show increased risk to convert to dementia with increasing HCy concentration, but was significant in naMCI (p = 0.04). We observed a non-significant increase in the risk of progression to dementia from naMCI/low HCy (reference group, HCy cutoff value = 16 μmol/L) to naMCI/high HCy, but it was significant from aMCI/low HCy (HR: 2.73; 95%CI: 1.06-7.0; p:0.03), to aMCI/high HCy (HR: 3.24; 95%CI: 1.17-8.47; p:0.02). Our results suggest that HCy levels are associated with the progression from MCI to dementia. This association seems significant only for the naMCI group, indirectly supporting the notion that hyperhomocysteinemia damages the nervous system through its role as a vascular risk factor.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Amnestic MCI; Dementia; Homocysteine; Mild cognitive impairment; Non-amnestic MCI,"Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Homocysteine; Male; Dementia; Female; Disease Progression; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Follow-Up Studies","Zuliani, G; Brombo, G; Polastri, M; Romagnoli, T; Mola, G; Riccetti, R; Seripa, D; Trentini, A; Cervellati, C"

Unbiased insights into the multiplicity of the CYP46A1 brain effects in 5XFAD mice treated with low dose-efavirenz.,"Cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) is the CNS-specific cholesterol 24-hydroxylase that controls cholesterol elimination and turnover in the brain. In mouse models, pharmacologic CYP46A1 activation with low-dose efavirenz or by gene therapy mitigates the manifestations of various brain disorders, neurologic, and nonneurologic, by affecting numerous, apparently unlinked biological processes. Accordingly, CYP46A1 is emerging as a promising therapeutic target; however, the mechanisms underlying the multiplicity of the brain CYP46A1 activity effects are currently not understood. We proposed the chain reaction hypothesis, according to which CYP46A1 is important for the three primary (unifying) processes in the brain (sterol flux through the plasma membranes, acetyl-CoA, and isoprenoid production), which in turn affect a variety of secondary processes. We already identified several processes secondary to changes in sterol flux and herein undertook a multiomics approach to compare the brain proteome, acetylproteome, and metabolome of 5XFAD mice (an Alzheimer's disease model), control and treated with low-dose efavirenz. We found that the latter had increased production of phospholipids from the corresponding lysophospholipids and a globally increased protein acetylation (including histone acetylation). Apparently, these effects were secondary to increased acetyl-CoA production. Signaling of small GTPases due to their altered abundance or abundance of their regulators could be affected as well, potentially via isoprenoid biosynthesis. In addition, the omics data related differentially abundant molecules to other biological processes either reported previously or new. Thus, we obtained unbiased mechanistic insights and identified potential players mediating the multiplicity of the CYP46A1 brain effects and further detailed our chain reaction hypothesis.",2024,brain lipids; cholesterol metabolism; glycerophospholipids; oxysterols; proteomics,"Animals; Cholesterol 24-Hydroxylase; Alkynes; Brain; Mice; Benzoxazines; Cyclopropanes; Alzheimer Disease; Mice, Transgenic; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug","Mast, N; Butts, M; Pikuleva, IA"
Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) for the Symptomatic Treatment of Dementia-Related Diseases: A Systematic Review.,"Pathomechanisms of dementias involve increasing damage to neuronal energy metabolism, resulting in degeneration-related insulin resistance and glucose hypometabolism. In this case, ketone bodies can provide an alternative energy source. Supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which can induce ketogenesis, may alleviate brain energy deficits and improve neuronal function. This review aims to determine the effectiveness of MCT as a symptomatic treatment approach. The systematic literature search was conducted in April 2023 following the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. A total of 21 studies were included, comprising eight uncontrolled trials and 13 RCTs investigating the effects of MCT on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A substantial increase in plasma ketone levels and brain metabolic rates was observed. Cognitive assessments showed only occasional or domain-specific performance improvements. The effects on functional abilities or psychological outcomes have been inadequately studied. Besides gastrointestinal side effects, no harmful effects were observed. However, the evidence was severely weakened by heterogeneous and poorly designed study protocols, bias, and conflicts of interest. In conclusion, the ketogenic properties of MCTs may have beneficial effects on brain metabolism in AD and MCI but do not always result in measurable clinical improvement. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend MCT as a comparable symptomatic treatment option.",2024,,,"Meer, N; Fischer, T"

Ribonuclease activity undermines immune sensing of naked extracellular RNA.,"The plasma membrane and the membrane of endosomal vesicles are considered physical barriers preventing extracellular RNA uptake. While naked RNA can be spontaneously internalized by certain cells types, functional delivery of naked RNA into the cytosol has been rarely observed. Here we show that extracellular ribonucleases, mainly derived from cell culture supplements, have so far hindered the study of extracellular RNA functionality. In the presence of active ribonuclease inhibitors (RI), naked bacterial RNA is pro-inflammatory when spiked in the media of dendritic cells and macrophages. In murine cells, this response mainly depends on the action of endosomal Toll-like receptors. However, we also show that naked RNA can perform endosomal escape and engage with cytosolic RNA sensors and ribosomes. For example, naked mRNAs encoding reporter proteins can be spontaneously internalized and translated by a variety of cell types, in an RI-dependent manner. In vivo, RI co-injection enhances the activation induced by naked extracellular RNA on splenic lymphocytes and myeloid-derived leukocytes. Furthermore, naked extracellular RNA is inherently pro-inflammatory in ribonuclease-poor compartments such as the peritoneal cavity. Overall, these results demonstrate that naked RNA is bioactive and does not need encapsulation inside synthetic or biological lipid vesicles for functional uptake, making a case for nonvesicular extracellular RNA-mediated intercellular communication.",2024,,,"Castellano, M; Blanco, V; Calzi, ML; Costa, B; Witwer, K; Hill, M; Cayota, A; Segovia, M; Tosar, JP"

A total of 897 subjects were included, including 635 from the SILCODE cohort (mean [SD] age, 64.93 [6.78] years; 343 [63%] female) and 262 from the ADNI cohort (mean [SD] age, 73.96 [7.06] years; 140 [53%] female). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the optimal model was 0.9414 and 0.8979 in the training and validation dataset, respectively. A calibration analysis displayed excellent consistency between the prognosis and actual observation. The findings of the present study provide a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying at-risk individuals for AD and highlight the pivotal role of the radiomic biomarker. Importantly, built upon data-driven analyses commonly seen in previous radiomics studies, our research delves into AD pathology to further elucidate the underlying reasons behind the robust predictive performance of the MRI radiomic predictor.",2024,,,"Yu, X; Sun, X; Wei, M; Deng, S; Zhang, Q; Guo, T; Shao, K; Zhang, M; Jiang, J; Han, Y"

"At-Home Administration of Gantenerumab by Care Partners to People with Early Alzheimer's Disease: Feasibility, Safety and Pharmacodynamic Impact.","Monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid-beta and remove amyloid plaques can slow cognitive and functional decline in early Alzheimer's disease. Gantenerumab is a subcutaneously administered fully-human anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody with highest affinity for aggregated amyloid-beta. Since the phase 3 GRADUATE trials did not meet the primary endpoint (change from baseline to Week 116 in Clinical Dementia Rating scale - Sum of Boxes), development of gantenerumab in sporadic Alzheimer's disease was stopped and all ongoing trials were terminated early due to sponsor decision. Subcutaneous administration at the clinic or at home by care partner would be an important option for other therapies in this class in order to increase flexibility and reduce overall burden.

Unraveling the molecular basis of cannabidiolic acid methyl Ester's anti-depressive effects in a rat model of treatment-resistant depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) stands as a significant cause of disability globally. Cannabidiolic Acid-Methyl Ester (CBDA-ME) (EPM-301, HU-580), a derivative of Cannabidiol, demonstrates immediate antidepressant-like effects, yet it has undergone only minimal evaluation in psychopharmacology. Our goal was to investigate the behavioral and potential molecular mechanisms associated with the chronic oral administration of this compound in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) genetic model of treatment-resistant depression. Male WKY rats were subjected to behavioral assessments before and after receiving chronic (14-day) oral doses of CBDA-ME (0.5 mg/kg), 15 mg/kg of imipramine or vehicle. At the end of the study, plasma corticosterone levels and mRNA expression of various genes in the medial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus were measured. Behavioral outcomes from CBDA-ME treatment indicated an antidepressant-like effect similar to imipramine, as oral ingestion reduced immobility and increased swimming duration in the Forced Swim Test. Neither treatment influenced locomotion in the Open Field Test nor preference in the Saccharin Preference Test. The behavioral impact in WKY rats coincided with reduced corticosterone serum levels, upregulated mRNA expression of Cannabinoid receptor 1, Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase, and Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor 1, alongside downregulation of the Serotonin Transporter in the hippocampus. Additionally, there was an upregulation of CB1 mRNA expression and downregulation of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in the mPFC. These findings contribute to our limited understanding of the antidepressant effects of CBDA-ME and shed light on its potential psychopharmacological mechanisms. This discovery opens up possibilities for utilizing cannabinoids in the treatment of major depressive disorder and related conditions.",2024,Cannabidiolic acid methyl ester; Endocannabinoid system; Genetic animal models of depression; Major depression disorder; Molecular mechanisms; Wistar–Kyoto (WKY),,"Hen-Shoval, D; Indig-Naimer, T; Moshe, L; Kogan, NM; Zaidan, H; Gaisler-Salomon, I; Okun, E; Mechoulam, R; Shoval, G; Zalsman, G; Weller, A"
Personalized whole-brain neural mass models reveal combined Aβ and tau hyperexcitable influences in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuronal dysfunction and cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are likely caused by multiple pathophysiological factors. However, mechanistic evidence in humans remains scarce, requiring improved non-invasive techniques and integrative models. We introduce personalized AD computational models built on whole-brain Wilson-Cowan oscillators and incorporating resting-state functional MRI, amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau-PET from 132 individuals in the AD spectrum to evaluate the direct impact of toxic protein deposition on neuronal activity. This subject-specific approach uncovers key patho-mechanistic interactions, including synergistic Aβ and tau effects on cognitive impairment and neuronal excitability increases with disease progression. The data-derived neuronal excitability values strongly predict clinically relevant AD plasma biomarker concentrations (p-tau217, p-tau231, p-tau181, GFAP) and grey matter atrophy obtained through voxel-based morphometry. Furthermore, reconstructed EEG proxy quantities show the hallmark AD electrophysiological alterations (theta band activity enhancement and alpha reductions) which occur with Aβ-positivity and after limbic tau involvement. Microglial activation influences on neuronal activity are less definitive, potentially due to neuroimaging limitations in mapping neuroprotective vs detrimental activation phenotypes. Mechanistic brain activity models can further clarify intricate neurodegenerative processes and accelerate preventive/treatment interventions.",2024,,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Male; Female; Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Models, Neurological; Biomarkers; Aged, 80 and over; Electroencephalography; Neurons","Sanchez-Rodriguez, LM; Bezgin, G; Carbonell, F; Therriault, J; Fernandez-Arias, J; Servaes, S; Rahmouni, N; Tissot, C; Stevenson, J; Karikari, TK; Ashton, NJ; Benedet, AL; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Triana-Baltzer, G; Kolb, HC; Rosa-Neto, P; Iturria-Medina, Y"

Predicting amyloid-PET and clinical conversion in apolipoprotein E ε3/ε3 non-demented individuals with multidimensional factors.,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is a well-established risk factor of amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, because of the high prevalence of APOE ε3, there may be a large number of people with APOE ε3/ε3 who are non-demented and have Aβ pathology. There are limited studies on assessing Aβ status and clinical conversion in the APOE ε3/ε3 non-demented population. Two hundred and ninety-three non-demented individuals with APOE ε3/ε3 from ADNI database were divided into Aβ-positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) positivity (+) and Aβ-PET negativity (-) groups using cut-off value of >1.11. Stepwise regression searched for a single or multidimensional clinical variables for predicting Aβ-PET (+), and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) assessed the accuracy of the predictive models. The Cox regression model explored the risk factors associated with clinical conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. The results showed that the combination of sex, education, ventricle and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume can accurately predict Aβ-PET status in cognitively normal (CN), and the combination of everyday cognition study partner total (EcogSPTotal) score, age, plasma p-tau 181 and WMH can accurately predict Aβ-PET status in MCI individuals. EcogSPTotal score were independent predictors of clinical conversion to MCI or AD.

Evaluating p-tau217 and p-tau231 as Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis and Differentiation of Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review.,"The escalating prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlights the urgent need to develop reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention. AD is characterized by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins, particularly p-tau217 and p-tau231, have been identified as promising biomarker candidates to differentiate the disease progression from preclinical stages. This narrative review is devoted to a critical evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of p-tau217 and p-tau231 levels in the detection of AD, measured in plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, compared to established biomarkers. Additionally, the efficacy of these markers in distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative disorders is examined. The significant advances offered by p-tau217 and p-tau231 in AD diagnostics are highlighted, demonstrating their unique utility in early detection and differential diagnosis. This comprehensive analysis not only confirms the excellent diagnostic capabilities of these markers, but also deepens the understanding of the molecular dynamics of AD, contributing to the broader scientific discourse on neurodegenerative diseases. This review is aimed to provide key information for researchers and clinicians across disciplines, filling interdisciplinary gaps and highlighting the role of p-tau proteins in revolutionizing AD research and clinical practice.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid plaques; biomarker; diagnosis; neurodegenerative diseases; neurofibrillary tangles; p-tau; p-tau217; p-tau231; tau proteins,,"Jarek, DJ; Mizerka, H; Nuszkiewicz, J; Szewczyk-Golec, K"

Lipidomic Analysis of Plasma Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"Analysis of blood-based indicators of brain health could provide an understanding of early disease mechanisms and pinpoint possible intervention strategies. By examining lipid profiles in extracellular vesicles (EVs), secreted particles from all cells, including astrocytes and neurons, and circulating in clinical samples, important insights regarding the brain's composition can be gained. Herein, a targeted lipidomic analysis was carried out in EVs derived from plasma samples after removal of lipoproteins from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls. Differences were observed for selected lipid species of glycerolipids (GLs), glycerophospholipids (GPLs), lysophospholipids (LPLs) and sphingolipids (SLs) across three distinct EV subpopulations (all-cell origin, derived by immunocapture of CD9, CD81 and CD63; neuronal origin, derived by immunocapture of L1CAM; and astrocytic origin, derived by immunocapture of GLAST). The findings provide new insights into the lipid composition of EVs isolated from plasma samples regarding specific lipid families (MG, DG, Cer, PA, PC, PE, PI, LPI, LPE, LPC), as well as differences between AD and control individuals.

Exercised-enriched blood plasma rescues hippocampal impairments and cognitive deficits in an Alzheimer's disease model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and moderate exercise holds promise in ameliorating the ongoing neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Here, we investigated whether exercise-enriched blood plasm could yield a beneficial therapeutic effect on AD pathologies and cognitive decline in transgenic AD (P301S) mice. In this investigation, a cohort of 2-month-old C57BL/6 mice were granted continuous access to either a running wheel or a fixed wheel for 6 weeks. After that, their plasmas were extracted and subsequently injected intravenously into 4.5-month-old P301S mice biweekly over a 6-week period. A comprehensive methodology was then employed, integrating behavioral tests, pathology assessments, and biochemical analyses to unveil the potential anti-dementia implications of exercise-enriched blood plasma in P301S mice. Upon systemic administration, the findings revealed a noteworthy attenuation of hippocampus-dependent behavioral impairments in P301S mice. Conversely, blood plasma from sedentary counterparts exhibited no discernible impact. These effects were intricately associated with the mitigation of neuroinflammation, the augmentation of hippocampal adult neurogenesis, and a reduction of synaptic impairments following the administration of exercise-enriched blood plasma. These findings advance the proposition that administering exercise-enriched blood plasma may serve as an effective prophylactic measure against AD, opening avenues for further exploration and potential therapeutic interventions.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Blood plasma; Exercise; Inflammation; Neurogenesis,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Hippocampus; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Cognitive Dysfunction; Mice; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Transgenic; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Plasma; Male; Neurogenesis","Huang, T; Gong, XK; Liang, Z; Yang, R; Wu, L; Yang, C; Wu, M; Wang, XC; Shu, XJ; Bao, J"
Interaction of exogenous acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase with amyloid-β plaques in human brain tissue.,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and exhibit altered biochemical properties in human Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as in the transgenic 5XFAD mouse model of AD amyloidosis. In the brains of the 5XFAD mouse model devoid of BChE enzyme (5XFAD/BChE-KO), incubation of tissue sections with exogenous BChE purified from human plasma (pl-BChE) leads to its association with Aβ plaques and its biochemical properties are comparable to those reported for endogenous BChE associated with plaques in both human AD and in 5XFAD mouse brain tissue.

"Biomarker-based human and animal sperm phenotyping: the good, the bad and the ugly†.","Conventional, brightfield-microscopic semen analysis provides important baseline information about sperm quality of an individual; however, it falls short of identifying subtle subcellular and molecular defects in cohorts of ""bad,"" defective human and animal spermatozoa with seemingly normal phenotypes. To bridge this gap, it is desirable to increase the precision of andrological evaluation in humans and livestock animals by pursuing advanced biomarker-based imaging methods. This review, spiced up with occasional classic movie references but seriously scholastic at the same time, focuses mainly on the biomarkers of altered male germ cell proteostasis resulting in post-testicular carryovers of proteins associated with ubiquitin-proteasome system. Also addressed are sperm redox homeostasis, epididymal sperm maturation, sperm-seminal plasma interactions, and sperm surface glycosylation. Zinc ion homeostasis-associated biomarkers and sperm-borne components, including the elements of neurodegenerative pathways such as Huntington and Alzheimer disease, are discussed. Such spectrum of biomarkers, imaged by highly specific vital fluorescent molecular probes, lectins, and antibodies, reveals both obvious and subtle defects of sperm chromatin, deoxyribonucleic acid, and accessory structures of the sperm head and tail. Introduction of next-generation image-based flow cytometry into research and clinical andrology will soon enable the incorporation of machine and deep learning algorithms with the end point of developing simple, label-free methods for clinical diagnostics and high-throughput phenotyping of spermatozoa in humans and economically important livestock animals.",2024,biomarker; fertility; phenomics; proteome; sperm,Male; Humans; Biomarkers; Animals; Spermatozoa; Phenotype; Semen Analysis,"Sutovsky, P; Hamilton, LE; Zigo, M; Ortiz D'Avila Assumpção, ME; Jones, A; Tirpak, F; Agca, Y; Kerns, K; Sutovsky, M"

Rational design of a near-infrared fluorescent probe for monitoring butyrylcholinesterase activity and its application in development of inhibitors.,"Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is widely expressed in multiple tissues and has a vital role in several key human disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and tumorigenesis. However, the role of BChE in human disorders has not been investigated. Thus, to quantitatively detect and visualize dynamical variations in BChE activity is essential for exploring the biological roles of BChE in the progression of a number of human disorders. Herein, based on the substrate characteristics of BChE, we customized and synthesized three near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe substrates with cyanine-skeleton, and finally selected a NIR fluorescence probe substrate named CYBA. The CYBA demonstrated a significant increase in fluorescence when interacting with BChE, but mainly avoided AChE. Upon the addition of BChE, CYBA could be specifically hydrolyzed to TBO, resulting in a significant NIR fluorescence signal enhancement at 710 nm. Systematic evaluation revealed that CYBA exhibited exceptional chemical stability in complex biosamples and possessed remarkable selectivity and sensitivity towards BChE. Moreover, CYBA was successfully applied for real-time imaging of endogenous BChE activity in two types of nerve-related living cells. Additionally, CYBA demonstrated exceptional stability in the detection of complex biological samples in plasma recovery studies (97.51%-104.01%). Furthermore, CYBA was used to construct a high-throughput screening (HTS) method for BChE inhibitors using human plasma as the enzyme source. We evaluated inhibitory effects of a series of natural products and four flavonoids were identified as potent inhibitors of BChE. Collectively, CYBA can serve as a practical tool to track the changes of BChE activity in complicated biological environments due to its excellent capabilities.",2024,Butyrylcholinesterase; flavonoids; fluorescent probe; high-throughput screening; near-infrared,,"Li, H; Li, XD; Yan, CH; Ni, ZH; Lü, MH; Zou, LW; Yang, L"

Lecanemab blocks the effects of the Aβ/fibrinogen complex on blood clots and synapse toxicity in organotypic culture.,"Proteinaceous brain inclusions, neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction are common pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular deficits include a compromised blood-brain barrier, which can lead to extravasation of blood proteins like fibrinogen into the brain. Fibrinogen's interaction with the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide is known to worsen thrombotic and cerebrovascular pathways in AD. Lecanemab, an FDA-approved antibody therapy for AD, clears Aβ plaque from the brain and slows cognitive decline. Here, we show that lecanemab blocks fibrinogen's binding to Aβ protofibrils, preventing Aβ/fibrinogen-mediated delayed fibrinolysis and clot abnormalities in vitro and in human plasma. Additionally, we show that lecanemab dissociates the Aβ/fibrinogen complex and prevents fibrinogen from exacerbating Aβ-induced synaptotoxicity in mouse organotypic hippocampal cultures. These findings reveal a possible protective mechanism by which lecanemab may slow disease progression in AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-beta; fibrinogen; fibrinolysis; lecanemab,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Fibrinogen; Microphysiological Systems; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Thrombosis; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized","Singh, PK; Simões-Pires, EN; Chen, ZL; Torrente, D; Calvano, M; Sharma, A; Strickland, S; Norris, EH"

Mag-Net: Rapid enrichment of membrane-bound particles enables high coverage quantitative analysis of the plasma proteome.,"Membrane-bound particles in plasma are composed of exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies and represent ~1-2% of the total protein composition. Proteomic interrogation of this subset of plasma proteins augments the representation of tissue-specific proteins, representing a ""liquid biopsy,"" while enabling the detection of proteins that would otherwise be beyond the dynamic range of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of unfractionated plasma. We have developed an enrichment strategy (Mag-Net) using hyper-porous strong-anion exchange magnetic microparticles to sieve membrane-bound particles from plasma. The Mag-Net method is robust, reproducible, inexpensive, and requires <100 μL plasma input. Coupled to a quantitative data-independent mass spectrometry analytical strategy, we demonstrate that we can collect results for >37,000 peptides from >4,000 plasma proteins with high precision. Using this analytical pipeline on a small cohort of patients with neurodegenerative disease and healthy age-matched controls, we discovered 204 proteins that differentiate (q-value < 0.05) patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) from those without ADD. Our method also discovered 310 proteins that were different between Parkinson's disease and those with either ADD or healthy cognitively normal individuals.

Inhibition of Autophagy Alters Intracellular Transport of APP Resulting in Increased APP Processing.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and dysfunctional autophagy. Aβ is generated by sequential proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and the site of intracellular APP processing is highly debated, which may include autophagosomes. Here, we investigated the involvement of autophagy, including the role of ATG9 in APP intracellular trafficking and processing by applying the RUSH system, which allows studying the transport of fluorescently labeled mCherry-APP-EGFP in a systematic way, starting from the endoplasmic reticulum. HeLa cells, expressing the RUSH mCherry-APP-EGFP system, were investigated by live cell imaging, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. We found that mCherry-APP-EGFP passed through the Golgi faster in ATG9 knockout cells. Furthermore, ATG9 deletion shifted mCherry-APP-EGFP from early endosomes and lysosomes toward the plasma membrane concomitant with reduced endocytosis. Importantly, this alteration in mCherry-APP-EGFP transport resulted in increased secreted mCherry-soluble APP and C-terminal fragment-EGFP. These effects were also phenocopied by pharmacological inhibition of ULK1, indicating that autophagy is regulating the intracellular trafficking and processing of APP. These findings contribute to the understanding of the role of autophagy in APP metabolism and could potentially have implications for new therapeutic approaches for AD.",2024,APP; ATG9; Alzheimer; RUSH; autophagy; live cell imaging,Humans; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Amyloid beta-Peptides; HeLa Cells; Biological Transport; Autophagy; Alzheimer Disease,"Mayer, J; Boeck, D; Werner, M; Frankenhauser, D; Geley, S; Farhan, H; Shimozawa, M; Nilsson, P"

"Microfluidic Isolation of Neuronal-Enriched Extracellular Vesicles Shows Distinct and Common Neurological Proteins in Long COVID, HIV Infection and Alzheimer's Disease.","Long COVID (LongC) is associated with a myriad of symptoms including cognitive impairment. We reported at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that neuronal-enriched or L1CAM+ extracellular vesicles (nEVs) from people with LongC contained proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since that time, a subset of people with prior COVID infection continue to report neurological problems more than three months after infection. Blood markers to better characterize LongC are elusive. To further identify neuronal proteins associated with LongC, we maximized the number of nEVs isolated from plasma by developing a hybrid EV Microfluidic Affinity Purification (EV-MAP) technique. We isolated nEVs from people with LongC and neurological complaints, AD, and HIV infection with mild cognitive impairment. Using the OLINK platform that assesses 384 neurological proteins, we identified 11 significant proteins increased in LongC and 2 decreased (BST1, GGT1). Fourteen proteins were increased in AD and forty proteins associated with HIV cognitive impairment were elevated with one decreased (IVD). One common protein (BST1) was decreased in LongC and increased in HIV. Six proteins (MIF, ENO1, MESD, NUDT5, TNFSF14 and FYB1) were expressed in both LongC and AD and no proteins were common to HIV and AD.

Specific Binding of Alzheimer's Aβ Peptides to Extracellular Vesicles.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth leading cause of death among adults aged 65 and older, yet the onset and progression of the disease is poorly understood. What is known is that the presence of amyloid, particularly polymerized Aβ42, defines when people are on the AD continuum. Interestingly, as AD progresses, less Aβ42 is detectable in the plasma, a phenomenon thought to result from Aβ becoming more aggregated in the brain and less Aβ42 and Aβ40 being transported from the brain to the plasma via the CSF. We propose that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in this transport. EVs are found in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid and carry diverse ""cargos"" of bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites) that dynamically reflect changes in the cells from which they are secreted. While Aβ42 and Aβ40 have been reported to be present in EVs, it is not known whether this interaction is specific for these peptides and thus whether amyloid-carrying EVs play a role in AD and/or serve as brain-specific biomarkers of the AD process. To determine if there is a specific interaction between Aβ and EVs, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and discovered that Aβ42 and Aβ40 bind to EVs in a manner that is sequence specific, saturable, and endothermic. In addition, Aβ incubation with EVs overnight yielded larger amounts of bound Aβ peptide that was fibrillar in structure. These findings point to a specific amyloid-EV interaction, a potential role for EVs in the transport of amyloid from the brain to the blood, and a role for this amyloid pool in the AD process.",2024,amyloid; atomic force microscopy (AFM); extracellular vesicles (EVs); isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),Adult; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Peptides; Extracellular Vesicles; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Plasma,"Coughlan, C; Lindenberger, J; Jacot, JG; Johnson, NR; Anton, P; Bevers, S; Welty, R; Graner, MW; Potter, H"
"Neuropathology, Neuroimaging, and Fluid Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease.","An improved understanding of the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) should lead ultimately to an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of AD, providing the opportunity to intervene earlier in the disease process and to improve outcomes. The known hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. It is now clear that an imbalance between production and clearance of the amyloid beta protein and related Aβ peptides, especially Aβ42, is a very early, initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, leading to aggregates of hyperphosphorylation and misfolded tau protein, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. In this article, we review how the AD diagnostic process has been transformed in recent decades by our ability to measure these various elements of the pathological cascade through the use of imaging and fluid biomarkers.

Deep learning to predict rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease from pooled clinical trials: A retrospective study.,"The rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) differs dramatically between patients. Identifying the most is critical because when their numbers differ between treated and control groups, it distorts the outcome, making it impossible to tell whether the treatment was beneficial. Much recent effort, then, has gone into identifying RPs. We pooled de-identified placebo-arm data of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), EXPEDITION, EXPEDITION 2, and EXPEDITION 3, provided by Eli Lilly and Company. After processing, the data included 1603 mild-to-moderate AD patients with 80 weeks of longitudinal observations on neurocognitive health, brain volumes, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels. RPs were defined by changes in four neurocognitive/functional health measures. We built deep learning models using recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms to predict RPs by week 80 based on varying observation periods from baseline (e.g., 12, 28 weeks). Feature importance scores for RP prediction were computed and temporal feature trajectories were compared between RPs and non-RPs. Our evaluation and analysis focused on models trained with 28 weeks of observation. The models achieved robust internal validation area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROCs) ranging from 0.80 (95% CI 0.79-0.82) to 0.82 (0.81-0.83), and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRCs) from 0.34 (0.32-0.36) to 0.46 (0.44-0.49).

Aβ plasma levels, regional brain volumetry, and neurocognitive health emerged as important factors for the model prediction.

Cognitive deficit was induced by two doses of streptozotocin (2.25 mg/kg/day, 48 h interval) intracerebroventricularly. After, the mice were subcutaneously treated with 3j (8.62 mg/kg/day) for 25 days. The effects were assessed by evaluating hippocampal and cortical acetylcholinesterase and behavioral tasks. 3j toxicity was investigated for 10 (0, 21.55, or 43.10 mg/kg/day) and 37 (0, 4.31, or 8.62 mg/kg/day) days by assessing biometric parameters and glucose and urea levels, and alanine aminotransferase activity in blood plasma. 3j exposure did not alter the behavioral alterations induced by streptozotocin exposure. On the other hand, 3j exposure normalized hippocampus acetylcholinesterase activity, which is enhanced by streptozotocin exposure.

Effect of GM1 concentration change on plasma membrane: molecular dynamics simulation and analysis.,"Ganglioside GM1 is a class of glycolipids predominantly located in the nervous system. Comprising a ceramide anchor and an oligosaccharide chain containing sialic acid, GM1 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and membrane organization. Moreover, GM1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. In this study, by creating a neural cell model membrane simulation system and employing rigorous molecular models, we utilize a coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach to explore the structural and dynamic characteristics of multi-component neuronal plasma membranes at varying GM1 ganglioside concentrations. The simulation results reveal that as GM1 concentration increases, a greater number of hydrogen bonds form between GM1 molecules, resulting in the formation of larger clusters, which leads to reduced membrane fluidity, increased lipid ordering, decreased membrane thickness and surface area and higher levels of GM1 dissociation. Through a meticulous analysis, while considering GM1's structural attributes, we offer valuable insights into the structural and dynamic traits of the cell membrane. This study provides a robust methodology for exploring membrane characteristics and enhances our comprehension of GM1 molecules, serving as a resource for both experimental and computational researchers in this field.",2024,,Molecular Dynamics Simulation; G(M1) Ganglioside; Cell Membrane; Hydrogen Bonding; Lipid Bilayers,"Lyu, Y; Chen, S; Zhao, Y; Yuan, H; Zhang, C; Zhang, C; Meng, Q"

Thermotherapy has Sexually Dimorphic Responses in APP/PS1 Mice.,"A thermoregulatory decline occurs with age due to changes in muscle mass, vasoconstriction, and metabolism that lowers core body temperature (Tc). Although lower Tc is a biomarker of successful aging, we have previously shown this worsens cognitive performance in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1]. We hypothesized that elevating Tc with thermotherapy would improve metabolism and cognition in APP/PS1 mice. From 6-12 months of age, male and female APP/PS1 and C57BL/6 mice were chronically housed at 23 or 30°C. At 12 months of age, mice were assayed for insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and spatial cognition. Plasma, hippocampal, and peripheral (adipose, hepatic, and skeletal muscle) samples were procured postmortem and tissue-specific markers of amyloid accumulation, metabolism, and inflammation were assayed. Chronic 30°C exposure increased Tc in all groups except female APP/PS1 mice. All mice receiving thermotherapy had either improved glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity, but the underlying processes responsible for these effects varied across sexes. In males, glucose regulation was influenced predominantly by hormonal signaling in plasma and skeletal muscle glucose transporter 4 expression, whereas in females, this was modulated at the tissue level. Thermotherapy improved spatial navigation in male C57BL/6 and APP/PS1 mice, with the later attributed to reduced hippocampal soluble amyloid-β (Aβ)",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; cognition; core body temperature; glucose tolerance; insulin sensitivity; metabolism,,"McFadden, SA; Peck, MR; Sime, LN; Cox, MF; Ikiz, ED; Findley, CA; Quinn, K; Fang, Y; Bartke, A; Hascup, ER; Hascup, KN"
Proteome-wide association studies using summary proteomic data identified 23 risk genes of Alzheimer's disease.,"Characterizing the genetic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is crucial for developing new therapeutics. Proteome-wide association study (PWAS) integrating proteomics data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data was shown as a powerful tool for detecting risk genes. The identified PWAS risk genes can be interpretated as having genetic effects mediated through the genetically regulated protein abundances. Existing PWAS analyses of AD often rely on the availability of individual-level proteomics and genetics data of a reference cohort. Leveraging summary-level protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) reference data of multiple relevant tissues is expected to improve PWAS findings for studying AD. Here, we applied our recently developed OTTERS tool to conduct PWAS of AD dementia, by leveraging summary-level pQTL data of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma tissues, and multiple statistical methods. For each target protein, imputation models of the protein abundance with genetic predictors were trained from summary-level pQTL data, estimating a set of pQTL weights for considered genetic predictors. PWAS p-values were obtained by integrating GWAS summary data of AD dementia with estimated pQTL weights. PWAS p-values from multiple statistical methods were combined by the aggregated Cauchy association test to yield one omnibus PWAS p-value for the target protein. We identified significant PWAS risk genes through omnibus PWAS p-values and analyzed their protein-protein interactions using STRING. Their potential causal effects were assessed by the probabilistic Mendelian randomization (PMR-Egger). As a result, we identified a total of 23 significant PWAS risk genes for AD dementia in brain, CSF, and plasma tissues, including 7 novel findings. We showed that 15 of these risk genes were interconnected within a protein-protein interaction network involving the well-known AD risk gene of ",2024,Alzheimer’s disease dementia; GWAS; OTTERS; PWAS; pQTL summary data,,"Hu, T; Dai, Q; Epstein, MP; Yang, J"
Increased molar ratio of free fatty acids to albumin in blood as cause and early biomarker for the development of cataracts and Alzheimer's disease.,"Cataracts and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are closely linked and are associated with aging and with systemic diseases that increase the molar ratio of free fatty acids to albumin (mFAR) in the blood. From the results of our earlier studies on the development of senile cataracts and from results recently published in the literature on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, we suggest that there is a common lipotoxic cascade for both diseases, explaining the strong connection between aging, an elevated mFAR in the blood, cataract formation, and AD. Long-chain free fatty acids (FFA) are transported in the blood as FFA/albumin complexes. In young people, vascular albumin barriers in the eyes and brain, very similar in their structure and effect, reduce the FFA/albumin complex concentration from around 650 μmol/l in the blood to 1-3 μmol/l in the aqueous humour of the eyes as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid of the brain. At such low concentrations the fatty acid uptake of the target cells - lens epithelial and brain cells - rises with increasing FFA/albumin complex concentrations, especially when the fatty acid load of albumin molecules is mFAR>1. At higher albumin concentrations, for instance in blood plasma or the interstitial tissue spaces, the fatty acid uptake of the target cells becomes increasingly independent of the FFA/albumin complex concentration and is mainly a function of the mFAR (Richieri et al., 1993). In the blood plasma of young people, the mFAR is normally below 1.0. In people over 40 years old, aging increases the mFAR by decreasing the plasma concentration of albumin and enhancing the plasma concentrations of FFA. The increase in the mFAR in association with C6-unsaturated FFA are risk factors for the vascular albumin barriers (Hennig et al., 1984). Damage to the vascular albumin barrier in the eyes and brain increases the concentration of FFA/albumin complex in the aqueous humour as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the death of lens epithelial and brain cells, the development of cataracts, and AD. An age-dependent increase in the concentration of FFA/albumin complex has been found in the aqueous humour of 177 cataract patients, correlating with the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic death of lens epithelial cells, lens opacification and cataracts (Iwig et al., 2004). Mitochondrial dysfunction is also an early crucial event in Alzheimer's pathology, closely connected with the generation of amyloid beta peptides (Leuner et al., 2012). Very recently, amyloid beta production has also been confirmed in the lenses of Alzheimer's patients, causing cataracts (Moncaster et al., 2022). In view of this, we propose that there is a common lipotoxic cascade for senile cataract formation and senile AD, initiated by aging and/or systemic diseases, leading to an mFAR>1 in the blood.",2024,Aging; Albumin; Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; Cataracts; Free fatty acids; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Vascular albumin barriers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cataract; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Biomarkers; Serum Albumin; Aging; Lens, Crystalline","Glaesser, D; Iwig, M"
Plasma ADAM10 Levels and Their Association with Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in Older Adults with Fewer Years of Formal Education.,"Low educational attainment is a potential risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) development.

Towards a Unitary Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis.,"The ""amyloid cascade"" hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis invokes the accumulation in the brain of plaques (containing the amyloid-β protein precursor [AβPP] cleavage product amyloid-β [Aβ]) and tangles (containing hyperphosphorylated tau) as drivers of pathogenesis. However, the poor track record of clinical trials based on this hypothesis suggests that the accumulation of these peptides is not the only cause of AD. Here, an alternative hypothesis is proposed in which the AβPP cleavage product C99, not Aβ, is the main culprit, via its role as a regulator of cholesterol metabolism. C99, which is a cholesterol sensor, promotes the formation of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a cholesterol-rich lipid raft-like subdomain of the ER that communicates, both physically and biochemically, with mitochondria. We propose that in early-onset AD (EOAD), MAM-localized C99 is elevated above normal levels, resulting in increased transport of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to membranes of intracellular organelles, such as ER/endosomes, thereby upregulating MAM function and driving pathology. By the same token, late-onset AD (LOAD) is triggered by any genetic variant that increases the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol that, in turn, boosts the levels of C99 and again upregulates MAM function. Thus, the functional cause of AD is upregulated MAM function that, in turn, causes the hallmark disease phenotypes, including the plaques and tangles. Accordingly, the MAM hypothesis invokes two key interrelated elements, C99 and cholesterol, that converge at the MAM to drive AD pathogenesis. From this perspective, AD is, at bottom, a lipid disorder.",2024,Amyloid; C99; MAM; cholesterol; endoplasmic reticulum; mitochondria,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Mitochondria; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Cholesterol,"Area-Gomez, E; Schon, EA"

Low TGF-β1 plasma levels are associated with cognitive decline in Down syndrome.,"Almost all individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) show the characteristic neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the age of 40, yet not every individual with DS experiences symptoms of AD later in life. Similar to neurotypical developing subjects, AD in people with DS lasts for a long preclinical phase in which biomarkers follow a predictable order of changes. Hence, a prolonged asymptomatic period precedes the onset of dementia, underscoring the importance of identifying new biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline in individuals with DS. Blood-based biomarkers may offer an alternative non-invasive strategy for the detection of peripheral biological alterations paralleling nervous system pathology in an early phase of the AD continuum. In the last few years, a strong neurobiological link has been demonstrated between the deficit of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) levels, an anti-inflammatory cytokine endowed with neuroprotective activity, and early pro-inflammatory processes in the AD brain. In this clinical prospective observational study, we found significant lower plasma TGF-β1 concentrations at the first neuropsychological evaluation (baseline = T0) both in young adult DS individuals (19-35 years) and older DS subjects without AD (35-60 years) compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Interestingly, we found that the lower TGF-β1 plasma concentrations at T0 were strongly correlated with the following cognitive decline at 12 months. In addition, in young individuals with DS, we found, for the first time, a negative correlation between low TGF-β1 concentrations and high TNF-α plasma concentrations, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is known to be associated with cognitive impairment in DS individuals with AD.

Performance of SOBA-AD blood test in discriminating Alzheimer's disease patients from cognitively unimpaired controls in two independent cohorts.,"Amyloid-beta (Aβ) toxic oligomers are critical early players in the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have developed a Soluble Oligomer Binding Assay (SOBA-AD) for detection of these Aβ oligomers that contain α-sheet secondary structure that discriminates plasma samples from patients on the AD continuum from non-AD controls. We tested 265 plasma samples from two independent cohorts to investigate the performance of SOBA-AD. Testing was performed at two different sites, with different personnel, reagents, and instrumentation. Across two cohorts, SOBA-AD discriminated AD patients from cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects with 100% sensitivity, > 95% specificity, and > 98% area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.95-1.00). A SOBA-AD positive readout, reflecting α-sheet toxic oligomer burden, was found in AD patients, and not in controls, providing separation of the two populations, aside from 5 SOBA-AD positive controls. Based on an earlier SOBA-AD study, the Aβ oligomers detected in these CU subjects may represent preclinical cases of AD. The results presented here support the value of SOBA-AD as a promising blood-based tool for the detection and confirmation of AD.",2024,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Protein Structure, Secondary; Hematologic Tests; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins","Chen, A; Shea, D; Daggett, V"

Furthermore, BD-tau showed no or much weaker correlations with age, renal function, other comorbidities/risk factors and self-identified race/ethnicity, compared with other blood biomarkers.

Recent Advances in the Treatment and Management of Alzheimer's Disease: A Precision Medicine Perspective.,"About 60% to 70% of people with dementia have Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a neuro-degenerative illness. One reason for this disorder is the misfolding of naturally occurring proteins in the human brain, specifically β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. Certain diagnostic imaging techniques, such as amyloid PET imaging, tau PET imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Comput-erized Tomography (CT), and others, can detect biomarkers in blood, plasma, and cerebral spinal fluids, like an increased level of β-amyloid, plaques, and tangles. In order to create new pharma-cotherapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, researchers must have a thorough and detailed knowledge of amyloid beta misfolding and other related aspects. Dolopezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are among the medications now used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Another medication that can temporarily alleviate dementia symptoms is memantine, which blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. However, it is not able to halt or re-verse the progression of the disease. Medication now on the market can only halt its advance-ment, not reverse it. Interventions to alleviate behavioral and psychological symptoms, exhibit an-ti-neuroinflammation and anti-tau effects, induce neurotransmitter alteration and cognitive en-hancement, and provide other targets have recently been developed. For some Alzheimer's pa-tients, the FDA-approved monoclonal antibody, aducanumab, is an option; for others, phase 3 clinical studies are underway for drugs, like lecanemab and donanemab, which have demonstrat-ed potential in eliminating amyloid protein. However, additional study is required to identify and address these limitations in order to reduce the likelihood of side effects and maximize the thera-peutic efficacy.",2024,Alzheimer's disease anti-tau; Clinical trials; anti-amyloid; neuroprotection; precision medicine.; tautopathy,,"Shukla, D; Suryavanshi, A; Bharti, SK; Asati, V; Mahapatra, DK"

The associations between type 2 diabetes and plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in the Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities (HABS-HD).,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects Latinos disproportionately. One of the reasons underlying this disparity may be type 2 diabetes (T2D) that is a risk factor for AD. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of T2D and AD blood biomarkers and the differences in these associations between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites. This study was a secondary analysis of baseline data from the observational Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities (HABS-HD) that investigated factors underlying health disparities in AD in Mexican Americans in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites. HABS-HD participants were excluded if they had missing data or were large outliers (z-scores >|4|) on a given AD biomarker. Fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured from clinical labs. T2D was diagnosed by licensed clinicians. Plasma amyloid-beta 42 and 40 (Aβ42/42) ratio, total tau (t-tau), and neurofilament light (NfL) were measured via ultra-sensitive Simoa assays. The sample sizes were 1,552 for Aβ42/40 ratio, 1,570 for t-tau, and 1,553 for NfL. Mexican Americans were younger (66.6±8.7 vs. 69.5±8.6) and had more female (64.9% female vs. 55.1%) and fewer years of schooling (9.5±4.6 vs. 15.6±2.5) than non-Hispanic Whites. Mexican Americans differed significantly from non-Hispanic Whites in blood glucose (113.5±36.6 vs. 99.2±17.0) and HbA1c (6.33±1.4 vs. 5.51±0.6) levels, T2D diagnosis (35.3% vs. 11.1%), as well as blood Aβ42/40 ratio (.051±.012 vs. .047±.011), t-tau (2.56±.95 vs. 2.33±.90), and NfL levels (16.3±9.5 vs. 20.3±10.3). Blood glucose, blood HbA1c, and T2D diagnosis were not related to Aβ42/40 ratio and t-tau but explained 3.7% of the variation in NfL (p < .001). Blood glucose and T2D diagnosis were not, while HbA1c was positively (b = 2.31, p < .001, β = 0.26), associated with NfL among Mexican Americans. In contrast, blood glucose, HbA1c, and T2D diagnosis were negatively (b = -0.09, p < .01, β = -0.26), not (b = 0.34, p = .71, β = 0.04), and positively (b = 3.32, p < .01, β = 0.33) associated with NfL, respectively in non-Hispanic Whites. To conclude, blood glucose and HbA1c levels and T2D diagnosis are associated with plasma NfL levels, but not plasma Aβ and t-tau levels. These associations differ in an ethnicity-specific manner and need to be further studied as a potential mechanism underlying AD disparities.",2024,,"Female; Humans; Male; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Brain; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glycated Hemoglobin; Health Inequities; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Aged","Yu, F; Pituch, KA; Maxfield, M; Baena, E; Geda, YE; Pruzin, JJ; Coon, DW; Shaibi, GQ"

The Influence of Lipid Electric Charge on the Binding of Aβ(1-42) Amyloid Peptide to Bilayers in the Liquid-Ordered State.,"The amyloidogenic Aβ peptides are widely considered as a pathogenic agent in Alzheimer's disease. Aβ(1-42) would form aggregates of amyloid fibrils on the neuron plasma membranes, thus perturbing neuronal functionality. Conflicting data are available on the influence of bilayer order on Aβ(1-42) binding to membranes. In the present study, a biophysical approach was used in which isothermal calorimetry and surface pressure measurements were applied to explore the interaction of Aβ(1-42) in either monomeric, oligomeric, or fibrillar form with model membranes (bilayers or monolayers) in the liquid-ordered state that were either electrically neutral or negatively charged. In the latter case, this contained phosphatidic acid, cardiolipin, or ganglioside. The calorimetric studies showed that Aβ(1-42) fibrils, oligomers, and monomers could bind and/or be inserted into bilayers, irrespective of electric charge, in the liquid-ordered state, except that monomers could not interact with electrically neutral bilayers. The monolayer studies in the Langmuir balance demonstrated that Aβ(1-42) aggregation hindered peptide insertion into the monolayer, hindered insertion in the decreasing order of monomer > oligomer > fibril, and that lipid composition did not cause large differences in insertion, apart from a slight facilitation of monomer and oligomer insertion by gangliosides.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ membrane binding; Aβ42; Langmuir balance; cholesterol; ganglioside; isothermal calorimetry; sphingomyelin; β-amyloid,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid; Peptide Fragments; Alzheimer Disease; Gangliosides,"Ahyayauch, H; Masserini, ME; Goñi, FM; Alonso, A"
Iron Dysregulation in Alzheimer's Disease: LA-ICP-MS Bioimaging of the Distribution of Iron and Ferroportin in the CA1 Region of the Human Hippocampus.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathological hallmarks, including β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, Tau tangles, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal iron (Fe) metabolism plays a role in AD pathogenesis, but the precise spatial distribution of the Fe and its transporters, such as ferroportin (FPN), within affected brain regions remains poorly understood. This study investigates the distribution of Fe and FPN in the CA1 region of the human hippocampus in AD patients with a micrometer lateral resolution using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). For this purpose, we visualized and quantified Fe and FPN in three separated CA1 layers: stratum molecular-radial (SMR), stratum pyramidal (SP) and stratum oriens (SO). Additionally, chromogenic immunohistochemistry was used to examine the distribution and colocalization with Tau and Aβ proteins. The results show that Fe accumulation was significantly higher in AD brains, particularly in SMR and SO. However, FPN did not present significantly changes in AD, although it showed a non-uniform distribution across CA1 layers, with elevated levels in SP and SO. Interestingly, minimal overlap was observed between Fe and FPN signals, and none between Fe and areas rich in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) or neuritic plaques (NP). In conclusion, the lack of correlation between Fe and FPN signals suggests complex regulatory mechanisms in AD Fe metabolism and deposition. These findings highlight the complexity of Fe dysregulation in AD and its potential role in disease progression.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; LA-ICP-MS; Tau; ferroportin; immunohistochemistry; iron homeostasis; iron transport proteins; β-amyloid,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Iron; Hippocampus; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Laser Therapy; tau Proteins; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Cation Transport Proteins,"Junceda, S; Cruz-Alonso, M; Fernandez, B; Pereiro, R; Martínez-Pinilla, E; Navarro, A"

Amyloid pathology mediates the associations between plasma fibrinogen and cognition in non-demented adults.,"Though previous studies revealed the potential associations of elevated levels of plasma fibrinogen with dementia, there is still limited understanding regarding the influence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers on these associations. We sought to investigate the interrelationships among fibrinogen, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, and cognition in non-demented adults. We included 1996 non-demented adults from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study and 337 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The associations of fibrinogen with AD biomarkers and cognition were explored using multiple linear regression models. The mediation analyses with 10 000 bootstrapped iterations were conducted to explore the mediating effects of AD biomarkers on cognition. In addition, interaction analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the influence of covariates on the relationships between fibrinogen and AD biomarkers. Participants exhibiting low Aβ42 were designated as A+, while those demonstrating high phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and total tau (Tau) were labeled as T+ and N+, respectively. Individuals with normal measures of Aβ42 and P-tau were categorized as the A-T- group, and those with abnormal levels of both Aβ42 and P-tau were grouped under A+T+. Fibrinogen was higher in the A+ subgroup compared to that in the A- subgroup (p = 0.026). Fibrinogen was higher in the A+T+ subgroup compared to that in the A-T- subgroup (p = 0.011). Higher fibrinogen was associated with worse cognition and Aβ pathology (all p < 0.05). Additionally, the associations between fibrinogen and cognition were partially mediated by Aβ pathology (mediation proportion range 8%-28%). Interaction analyses and subgroup analyses showed that age and ApoE ε4 affect the relationships between fibrinogen and Aβ pathology. Fibrinogen was associated with both cognition and Aβ pathology.

Ultrastructure of human brain tissue vitrified from autopsy revealed by cryo-ET with cryo-plasma FIB milling.,"Ultrastructure of human brain tissue has traditionally been examined using electron microscopy (EM) following fixation, staining, and sectioning, which limit resolution and introduce artifacts. Alternatively, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allows higher resolution imaging of unfixed cellular samples while preserving architecture, but it requires samples to be vitreous and thin enough for transmission EM. Due to these requirements, cryo-ET has yet to be employed to investigate unfixed, never previously frozen human brain tissue. Here we present a method for generating lamellae in human brain tissue obtained at time of autopsy that can be imaged via cryo-ET. We vitrify the tissue via plunge-freezing and use xenon plasma focused ion beam (FIB) milling to generate lamellae directly on-grid at variable depth inside the tissue. Lamellae generated in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue reveal intact subcellular structures including components of autophagy and potential pathologic tau fibrils. Furthermore, we reveal intact compact myelin and functional cytoplasmic expansions.

Ultrasensitive Aptasensing Platform for the Detection of β-Amyloid-42 Peptide Based on MOF Containing Bimetallic Porphyrin Graphene Oxide and Gold Nanoparticles.,"The prompt detection of diseases hinges on the accessibility and the capability to identify relevant biomarkers. The integration of aptamers and the incorporation of nanomaterials into signal transducers have not only expedited but also enhanced the development of nanoaptasensors, enabling heightened sensitivity and selectivity. Here, the bimetallic nickel-cobalt-porphyrin metal-organic framework ((Ni + Cu)TPyP MOF) is regarded as an electron mediator, immobilization platform for an Alzheimer aptamer and to increase the electrochemical signal for the detection of the main biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid β (Aβ-42). Furthermore, the ((Ni + Cu)TPyP MOF) was combined with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), on a gold electrode (GE) to provide an efficient interface for immobilizing aptamer strands. Concurrently, the incorporation of rGO and AuNPs imparts enhanced electrical conductivity and efficacious catalytic activity, establishing them as adept electrochemical indicators. Owing to the superior excellent electrical conductivity of rGO and AuNPs, coupled with the presence of ample mesoporous channels and numerous Ni and Cu metal sites within (Ni + Cu)TPyP MOF, this nanostructure with abundant functional groups is proficient in immobilizing a substantial quantity of aptamer. These interactions are achieved through robust π-π stacking and electrostatic interactions, alongside the high affinity between the thiol group of the aptamer and AuNPs concurrently. The as-prepared ternary (Au@(Ni + Cu)TPyP MOF/rGO) nanostructure electrode exhibited an enhancement in its electrochemically active surface area of about 7 times, compared with the bare electrode and the Aβ-42 redox process is highly accelerated, so the peak currents are significantly higher than those obtained with bare GE substrate.

Emerging Evidence of Golgi Stress Signaling for Neuropathies.,"The Golgi apparatus is an intracellular organelle that modifies cargo, which is transported extracellularly through the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane in order. First, the general function of the Golgi is reviewed and, then, Golgi stress signaling is discussed. In addition to the six main Golgi signaling pathways, two pathways that have been increasingly reported in recent years are described in this review. The focus then shifts to neurological disorders, examining Golgi stress reported in major neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. The review also encompasses findings related to other diseases, including hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, frontotemporal spectrum disorder/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, microcephaly, Wilson's disease, and prion disease. Most of these neurological disorders cause Golgi fragmentation and Golgi stress. As a result, strong signals may act to induce apoptosis.",2024,Golgi stress; neuronal disease; neuropathies,,"Shirai, R; Yamauchi, J"
Plasma p-tau212 antemortem diagnostic performance and prediction of autopsy verification of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.,"Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, including p-tau217, show high associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic change and clinical stage. Certain plasma p-tau217 assays recognize tau forms phosphorylated additionally at threonine-212, but the contribution of p-tau212 alone to AD is unknown. We developed a blood-based immunoassay that is specific to p-tau212 without cross-reactivity to p-tau217. Here, we examined the diagnostic utility of plasma p-tau212. In five cohorts (n = 388 participants), plasma p-tau212 showed high performances for AD diagnosis and for the detection of both amyloid and tau pathology, including at autopsy as well as in memory clinic populations. The diagnostic accuracy and fold changes of plasma p-tau212 were similar to those for p-tau217 but higher than p-tau181 and p-tau231. Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue slices showed prominent p-tau212 reactivity in neurofibrillary tangles that co-localized with p-tau217 and p-tau202/205.

Accurate quantification of amyloid-ß peptide, phosphorylated tau (pTau) isoforms, as well as markers of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain [NfL]) and neuro-immune activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40]) in blood has allowed researchers to characterize neurobiological processes at scale in a cost-effective and minimally invasive manner. Although currently used primarily for research purposes, these blood-based biomarkers have the potential to be highly impactful in the clinical setting - aiding in diagnosis, predicting disease risk, and monitoring disease progression. Whereas plasma NfL has shown promise as a non-specific marker of neuronal injury, plasma pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, and GFAP have demonstrated desirable levels of sensitivity and specificity for identification of individuals with Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. In this forward looking review, we (i) provide an overview of the most commonly used blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, (ii) discuss how comorbid medical conditions, demographic, and genetic factors can inform the interpretation of these biomarkers, (iii) describe ongoing efforts to move blood-based biomarkers into the clinic, and (iv) highlight the central role that clinical neuropsychologists may play in contextualizing and communicating blood-based biomarker results for patients.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; blood-based biomarkers; dementia; prediction,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Neuropsychology; Dementia; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Dark, HE; Duggan, MR; Walker, KA"

"Comparison of cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and neuroimaging biomarker utility in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are crucial to understanding disease pathophysiology, aiding accurate diagnosis and identifying target treatments. Although the number of biomarkers continues to grow, the relative utility and uniqueness of each is poorly understood as prior work has typically calculated serial pairwise relationships on only a handful of markers at a time. The present study assessed the cross-sectional relationships among 27 Alzheimer's disease biomarkers simultaneously and determined their ability to predict meaningful clinical outcomes using machine learning. Data were obtained from 527 community-dwelling volunteers enrolled in studies at the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in St Louis. We used hierarchical clustering to group 27 imaging, CSF and plasma measures of amyloid beta, tau [phosphorylated tau (p-tau), total tau t-tau)], neuronal injury and inflammation drawn from MRI, PET, mass-spectrometry assays and immunoassays. Neuropsychological and genetic measures were also included. Random forest-based feature selection identified the strongest predictors of amyloid PET positivity across the entire cohort. Models also predicted cognitive impairment across the entire cohort and in amyloid PET-positive individuals. Four clusters emerged reflecting: core Alzheimer's disease pathology (amyloid and tau), neurodegeneration, AT8 antibody-associated phosphorylated tau sites and neuronal dysfunction.

Evaluation of Exploratory Fluid Biomarker Results from a Phase 1 Senolytic Trial in Mild Alzheimer's Disease.,"Senescent cell accumulation contributes to the progression of age-related disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical trials evaluating senolytics, drugs that clear senescent cells, are underway, but lack standardized outcome measures. Our team recently published data from the first open-label trial to evaluate senolytics (dasatinib plus quercetin) in AD. After 12-weeks of intermittent treatment, we reported brain exposure to dasatinib, favorable safety and tolerability, and modest post-treatment changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory and AD biomarkers using commercially available assays. Herein, we present more comprehensive exploratory analyses of senolytic associated changes in AD relevant proteins, metabolites, lipids, and transcripts measured across blood, CSF, and urine. These analyses included mass spectrometry for precise quantification of amyloid beta (Aß) and tau in CSF; immunoassays to assess senescence associated secretory factors in plasma, CSF, and urine; mass spectrometry analysis of urinary metabolites and lipids in blood and CSF; and transcriptomic analyses relevant to chronic stress measured in peripheral blood cells. Levels of Aß and tau species remained stable. Targeted cytokine and chemokine analyses revealed treatment-associated increases in inflammatory plasma fractalkine and MMP-7 and CSF IL-6. Urinary metabolites remained unchanged. Modest treatment-associated lipid profile changes suggestive of decreased inflammation were observed both peripherally and centrally.

A blood-based biomarker workflow for optimal tau-PET referral in memory clinic settings.,"Blood-based biomarkers for screening may guide tau positrion emissition tomography (PET) scan referrals to optimize prognostic evaluation in Alzheimer's disease. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, NfL, and GFAP were measured along with tau-PET in memory clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment or dementia, in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study (n = 548) and in the TRIAD study (n = 179). For each plasma biomarker, cutoffs were determined for 90%, 95%, or 97.5% sensitivity to detect tau-PET-positivity. We calculated the percentage of patients below the cutoffs (who would not undergo tau-PET; ""saved scans"") and the tau-PET-positivity rate among participants above the cutoffs (who would undergo tau-PET; ""positive predictive value""). Generally, plasma pTau217 performed best. At the 95% sensitivity cutoff in both cohorts, pTau217 resulted in avoiding nearly half tau-PET scans, with a tau-PET-positivity rate among those who would be referred for a scan around 70%. And although tau-PET was strongly associated with subsequent cognitive decline, in BioFINDER-2 it predicted cognitive decline only among individuals above the referral cutoff on plasma pTau217, supporting that this workflow could reduce prognostically uninformative tau-PET scans.

Extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small vesicles released by cells that facilitate cell signaling. They are categorized based on their biogenesis and size. In the context of the central nervous system (CNS), EVs have been extensively studied for their role in both normal physiological functions and diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuronal death. EVs have emerged as potential biomarkers for AD due to their involvement in disease progression. Specifically, EVs derived from neurons, astrocytes, and neuron precursor cells exhibit changes in quantity and composition in AD. Neuron-derived EVs have been found to contain key proteins associated with AD pathology, such as amyloid beta (Aß) and tau. Increased levels of Aß in neuron-derived EVs isolated from the plasma have been observed in individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment, suggesting their potential as early biomarkers. However, the analysis of tau in neuron-derived EVs is still inconclusive. In addition to Aß and tau, neuron-derived EVs also carry other proteins linked to AD, including synaptic proteins. These findings indicate that EVs could serve as biomarkers for AD, particularly for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. However, further research is required to validate their use and explore potential therapeutic applications. To summarize, EVs are small vesicles involved in cell signaling within the CNS. They hold promise as biomarkers for AD, potentially enabling early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Ongoing research aims to refine their use as biomarkers and uncover additional therapeutic applications.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Disease Progression,"Berriel Pinho, VH; Daher, JPL; Kanaan, S; Medeiros, T"

Integrative Multimodal Metabolomics to Early Predict Cognitive Decline Among Amyloid Positive Community-Dwelling Older Adults.,"Alzheimer's disease is strongly linked to metabolic abnormalities. We aimed to distinguish amyloid-positive people who progressed to cognitive decline from those who remained cognitively intact. We performed untargeted metabolomics of blood samples from amyloid-positive individuals, before any sign of cognitive decline, to distinguish individuals who progressed to cognitive decline from those who remained cognitively intact. A plasma-derived metabolite signature was developed from Supercritical Fluid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (SFC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. The 2 metabolomics data sets were analyzed by Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent approaches for Omics studies (DIABLO), to identify a minimum set of metabolites that could describe cognitive decline status. NMR or SFC-HRMS data alone cannot predict cognitive decline. However, among the 320 metabolites identified, a statistical method that integrated the 2 data sets enabled the identification of a minimal signature of 9 metabolites (3-hydroxybutyrate, citrate, succinate, acetone, methionine, glucose, serine, sphingomyelin d18:1/C26:0 and triglyceride C48:3) with a statistically significant ability to predict cognitive decline more than 3 years before decline. This metabolic fingerprint obtained during this exploratory study may help to predict amyloid-positive individuals who will develop cognitive decline. Due to the high prevalence of brain amyloid-positivity in older adults, identifying adults who will have cognitive decline will enable the development of personalized and early interventions.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Bimodal metabolomics; Cognitive decline; Early prediction; Metabolite signature; Multiomics integrative method,Humans; Aged; Independent Living; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction; Brain; Metabolomics; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers,"Tremblay-Franco, M; Canlet, C; Carriere, A; Nakhle, J; Galinier, A; Portais, JC; Yart, A; Dray, C; Lu, WH; Bertrand Michel, J; Guyonnet, S; Rolland, Y; Vellas, B; Delrieu, J; Barreto, PS; Pénicaud, L; Casteilla, L; Ader, I"
Protective roles of peroxiporins AQP0 and AQP11 in human astrocyte and neuronal cell lines in response to oxidative and inflammatory stressors.,"In addition to aquaporin (AQP) classes AQP1, AQP4 and AQP9 known to be expressed in mammalian brain, our recent transcriptomic analyses identified AQP0 and AQP11 in human cortex and hippocampus at levels correlated with age and Alzheimer's disease (AD) status; however, protein localization remained unknown. Roles of AQP0 and AQP11 in transporting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in lens and kidney prompted our hypothesis that up-regulation in brain might similarly be protective. Established cell lines for astroglia (1321N1) and neurons (SHSY5Y, differentiated with retinoic acid) were used to monitor changes in transcript levels for human AQPs (AQP0 to AQP12) in response to inflammation (simulated with 10-100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide [LPS], 24 h), and hypoxia (5 min N2, followed by 0 to 24 h normoxia). AQP transcripts up-regulated in both 1321N1 and SHSY5Y included AQP0, AQP1 and AQP11. Immunocytochemistry in 1321N1 cells confirmed protein expression for AQP0 and AQP11 in plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum; AQP11 increased 10-fold after LPS and AQP0 increased 0.3-fold. In SHSY5Y cells, AQP0 expression increased 0.2-fold after 24 h LPS; AQP11 showed no appreciable change. Proposed peroxiporin roles were tested using melondialdehyde (MDA) assays to quantify lipid peroxidation levels after brief H2O2. Boosting peroxiporin expression by LPS pretreatment lowered subsequent H2O2-induced MDA responses (∼50%) compared with controls; conversely small interfering RNA knockdown of AQP0 in 1321N1 increased lipid peroxidation (∼17%) after H2O2, with a similar trend for AQP11 siRNA. Interventions that increase native brain peroxiporin activity are promising as new approaches to mitigate damage caused by aging and neurodegeneration.",2024,aquaporins; hydrogen peroxide; lipopolysaccharides; neurodegeneration; protein colocalization,Humans; Aquaporins; Astrocytes; Cell Line; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lipopolysaccharides; Neurons; Oxidative Stress; Eye Proteins; Neuroprotection,"Amro, Z; Collins-Praino, LE; Yool, AJ"
Deficiencies in one-carbon metabolism led to increased neurological disease risk and worse outcome: homocysteine is a marker of disease state.,"Elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been identified as a significant, independent risk factor for the development of cognitive decline including Alzheimer's disease. While several studies have explored the link between homocysteine and disease risk, the associations have not been entirely clear. Elevated levels of homocysteine serve as a disease marker and understanding the underlying cause of these increased levels (e.g., dietary or genetic deficiency in one-carbon metabolism, 1C) will provide valuable insights into neurological disease risk and outcomes. Previous cell culture experiments investigating the mechanisms involved used ultra-high levels of homocysteine that are not observed in human patients. These studies have demonstrated the negative impacts of ultra-high levels of homocysteine can have on for example proliferation of neuroprogenitor cells in the adult hippocampus, as well as triggering neuronal apoptosis through a series of events, including DNA damage, PARP activation, NAD depletion, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. The aim of this mini-review article will summarize the literature on deficiencies in 1C and how they contribute to disease risk and outcomes and that homocysteine is a marker of disease.",2024,cognitive decline; folate; folic acid; homocysteine; ischemic stroke; one-carbon metabolism,,"Joshi, SM; Jadavji, NM"

Associations of plasma proteomics and age-related outcomes with brain age in a diverse cohort.,"Machine learning models are increasingly being used to estimate ""brain age"" from neuroimaging data. The gap between chronological age and the estimated brain age gap (BAG) is potentially a measure of accelerated and resilient brain aging. Brain age calculated in this fashion has been shown to be associated with mortality, measures of physical function, health, and disease. Here, we estimate the BAG using a voxel-based elastic net regression approach, and then, we investigate its associations with mortality, cognitive status, and measures of health and disease in participants from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who had a brain MRI at visit 5 of the study. Finally, we used the SOMAscan assay containing 4877 proteins to examine the proteomic associations with the MRI-defined BAG. Among N = 1849 participants (age, 76.4 (SD 5.6)), we found that increased values of BAG were strongly associated with increased mortality and increased severity of the cognitive status. Strong associations with mortality persisted when the analyses were performed in cognitively normal participants. In addition, it was strongly associated with BMI, diabetes, measures of physical function, hypertension, prevalent heart disease, and stroke. Finally, we found 33 proteins associated with BAG after a correction for multiple comparisons. The top proteins with positive associations to brain age were growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), Sushi, von Willebrand factor type A, EGF, and pentraxin domain-containing protein 1 (SEVP 1), matrilysin (MMP7), ADAMTS-like protein 2 (ADAMTS), and heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B (HSPA1B) while EGF-receptor (EGFR), mast/stem-cell-growth-factor-receptor (KIT), coagulation-factor-VII, and cGMP-dependent-protein-kinase-1 (PRKG1) were negatively associated to brain age. Several of these proteins were previously associated with dementia in ARIC.

Multi-proteomic analyses of 5xFAD mice reveal new molecular signatures of early-stage Alzheimer's disease.,"An early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial as treatment efficacy is limited to the early stages. However, the current diagnostic methods are limited to mid or later stages of disease development owing to the limitations of clinical examinations and amyloid plaque imaging. Therefore, this study aimed to identify molecular signatures including blood plasma extracellular vesicle biomarker proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease to aid early-stage diagnosis. The hippocampus, cortex, and blood plasma extracellular vesicles of 3- and 6-month-old 5xFAD mice were analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Subsequent bioinformatics and biochemical analyses were performed to compare the molecular signatures between wild type and 5xFAD mice across different brain regions and age groups to elucidate disease pathology. There was a unique signature of significantly altered proteins in the hippocampal and cortical proteomes of 3- and 6-month-old mice. The plasma extracellular vesicle proteomes exhibited distinct informatic features compared with the other proteomes. Furthermore, the regulation of several canonical pathways (including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling) differed between the hippocampus and cortex. Twelve potential biomarkers for the detection of early-stage Alzheimer's disease were identified and validated using plasma extracellular vesicles from stage-divided patients. Finally, integrin α-IIb, creatine kinase M-type, filamin C, glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase 2, and lysosomal α-mannosidase were selected as distinguishing biomarkers for healthy individuals and early-stage Alzheimer's disease patients using machine learning modeling with approximately 79% accuracy.

Imaging Neuroinflammation: Quantification of Astrocytosis in a Multitracer PET Approach.,"The recent progress in the development of in vivo biomarkers is rapidly changing how neurodegenerative diseases are conceptualized and diagnosed and how clinical trials are designed today. Alzheimer's disease (AD) - the most common neurodegenerative disorder - is characterized by a complex neuropathology involving the deposition of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, accompanied by the activation of glial cells, i.e., astrocytes and microglia, and neuroinflammatory response, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. An increasing diversity of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging radiotracers is available to selectively target the different pathophysiological processes of AD. Along with the success of Aβ PET and the more recent tau PET imaging, there is a great interest to develop PET tracers to image glial reactivity and neuroinflammation. While most research to date has focused on imaging microgliosis, there is an upsurge of interest in imaging reactive astrocytes in the AD continuum. There is increasing evidence that reactive astrocytes are morphologically and functionally heterogeneous, with different subtypes that express different markers and display various homeostatic or detrimental roles across disease stages. Therefore, multiple biomarkers are desirable to unravel the complex phenomenon of reactive astrocytosis. In the field of in vivo PET imaging in AD, the research concerning reactive astrocytes has predominantly focused on targeting monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), most often using either ",2024,11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB); 11C-deuterium-L-deprenyl; 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG); Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid; Astrocytosis; Multitracer PET imaging; Neuroinflammation; Positron emission tomography,"Humans; Gliosis; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Inflammation; Plaque, Amyloid; Biomarkers","Rodriguez-Vieitez, E; Kumar, A; Malarte, ML; Ioannou, K; Rocha, FM; Chiotis, K"

A Simplified Proteomics LC-MRM-MS Assay for Determination of apoE Genotypes in Plasma Samples.,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a polymorphic plasma protein, plays a pivotal role in lipid transportation. The human apoE gene possesses three major alleles (ε2, ε3, and ε4), which differ by single amino acid (cysteine to arginine) substitutions. The ε4 allele represents the primary genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas the ε2 allele protects against the disease. Knowledge of a patient's apoE genotype has high diagnostic value. A recent study has introduced an LC-MRM-MS-based proteomic approach for apoE isoform genotyping using stable isotope-labeled peptide internal standards (SIS). Here, our goal was to develop a simplified LC-MRM-MS assay for identifying apoE genotypes in plasma samples, eliminating the need for the use of SIS peptides. To determine the apoE genotypes, we monitored the chromatographic peak area ratios of isoform-specific peptides relative to a peptide that is common to all apoE isoforms. The assay results correlated well with the standard TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, and we observed a concordance between the two methods for all but three out of 172 samples. DNA sequencing of these three samples has confirmed that the results of the LC-MRM-MS method were correct. Thus, our simplified UPLC-MRM-MS assay is a feasible and reliable method for identifying apoE genotypes without using SIS internal standard peptides. The approach can be seamlessly incorporated into existing quantitative proteomics assays and kits, providing additional valuable apoE genotype information. The principle of using signal ratios of the protein isoform-specific peptides to the peptide common for all of the protein isoforms has the potential to be used for protein isoform determination in general.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; LC-MRM-MS; apoE genotype; apolipoprotein E,Humans; Proteomics; Apolipoproteins E; Genotype; Alzheimer Disease; Alleles; Protein Isoforms; Peptides,"Qasrawi, DO; Al-Ghabkari, A; Khan, RM; Petrotchenko, EV; Montero-Odasso, M; Borchers, CH"

Beyond CSF and Neuroimaging Assessment: Evaluating Plasma miR-145-5p as a Potential Biomarker for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. New strategies for the early detection of MCI and sporadic AD are crucial for developing effective treatment options. Current techniques used for diagnosis of AD are invasive and/or expensive, so they are not suitable for population screening. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers such as amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) levels are core biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD. Several studies have proposed the use of blood-circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential novel early biomarkers for AD. We therefore applied a novel approach to identify blood-circulating miRNAs associated with CSF biomarkers and explored the potential of these miRNAs as biomarkers of AD. In total, 112 subjects consisting of 28 dementia due to AD cases, 63 MCI due to AD cases, and 21 cognitively healthy controls were included. We identified seven Aβ1-42-associated plasma miRNAs, six P-tau181-associated plasma miRNAs, and nine Aβ1-42-associated serum miRNAs. These miRNAs were involved in AD-relevant biological processes, such as PI3K/AKT signaling. Based on this signaling pathway, we constructed an miRNA-gene target network, wherein miR-145-5p has been identified as a hub. Furthermore, we showed that miR-145-5p performs best in the prediction of both AD and MCI. Moreover, miR-145-5p also improved the prediction performance of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. The performance of this miRNA was validated using different datasets including an RT-qPCR dataset from plasma samples of 23 MCI cases and 30 age-matched controls. These findings indicate that blood-circulating miRNAs that are associated with CSF biomarkers levels and specifically plasma miR-145-5p alone or combined with the MMSE score can potentially be used as noninvasive biomarkers for AD or MCI screening in the general population, although studies in other AD cohorts are necessary for further validation.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; PI3K/AKT signaling; biomarkers; miR-145; microRNAs,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Cognitive Dysfunction; MicroRNAs; Biomarkers; Neuroimaging; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Wen, Q; Wittens, MMJ; Engelborghs, S; van Herwijnen, MHM; Tsamou, M; Roggen, E; Smeets, B; Krauskopf, J; Briedé, JJ"

TNF-α Levels Are Increased in Patients with Subjective Cognitive Impairment and Are Negatively Correlated with β Amyloid-42.,"The role of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently become a topic of debate. TNF-α levels increase in the blood of patients with AD, and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques contain TNF-α deposits. The therapeutic efficacy of blocking TNF-α in patients with AD remains controversial as it is mostly based on preclinical studies. Thus, whether and how TNF-α contributes to amyloidogenic processes in AD is still an open question to be addressed. We analyzed plasma TNF-α and Aβ42 levels in patients with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, and in healthy volunteers (HLT). In addition, we performed correlation analysis to evaluate whether changes in plasma TNF-α levels correlate with cognitive decline, Aβ42 levels, age, and BMI, which are all factors considered to contribute to or predispose individuals to AD. We found that TNF-α and Aβ42 plasma levels were higher in patients with AD than in HLT individuals. High TNF-α levels were also observed in patients with SCI, in whom TNF-α and Aβ42 levels were negatively correlated. Notably, TNF-α did not affect the amyloidogenic pathway in human microglial cultures exposed to 48 h of incubation, although it did trigger neuroinflammatory processes. These results imply that high TNF-α levels are more likely to be a clinical condition linked to AD than are direct contributors. Nonetheless, elevated levels of TNF-α in early-stage patients, like those with SCI and MCI, may provide a distinguishing feature for identifying clinical profiles that are at risk of having a poorer outcome in AD and could benefit from tailored therapies.",2024,APP Tyr682 phosphorylation; Alzheimer’s disease; Fyn; TNF-α; amyloid beta; biomarkers; mild cognitive impairment; neurodegeneration; neuroinflammation; subjective cognitive impairment,,"Serafini, S; Ferretti, G; Monterosso, P; Angiolillo, A; Di Costanzo, A; Matrone, C"

Highly accurate blood test for Alzheimer's disease is similar or superior to clinical cerebrospinal fluid tests.,"With the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying therapies, identifying patients who could benefit from these treatments becomes critical. In this study, we evaluated whether a precise blood test could perform as well as established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Plasma %p-tau217 (ratio of phosporylated-tau217 to non-phosphorylated tau) was analyzed by mass spectrometry in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n = 1,422) and the US Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) cohort (n = 337). Matched CSF samples were analyzed with clinically used and FDA-approved automated immunoassays for Aβ42/40 and p-tau181/Aβ42. The primary and secondary outcomes were detection of brain Aβ or tau pathology, respectively, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the reference standard. Main analyses were focused on individuals with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia), which is the target population for available disease-modifying treatments. Plasma %p-tau217 was clinically equivalent to FDA-approved CSF tests in classifying Aβ PET status, with an area under the curve (AUC) for both between 0.95 and 0.97. Plasma %p-tau217 was generally superior to CSF tests in classification of tau-PET with AUCs of 0.95-0.98. In cognitively impaired subcohorts (BioFINDER-2: n = 720; Knight ADRC: n = 50), plasma %p-tau217 had an accuracy, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 89-90% for Aβ PET and 87-88% for tau PET status, which was clinically equivalent to CSF tests, further improving to 95% using a two-cutoffs approach. Blood plasma %p-tau217 demonstrated performance that was clinically equivalent or superior to clinically used FDA-approved CSF tests in the detection of AD pathology.

Brain structural indicators of β-amyloid neuropathology.,"Recent efforts demonstrated the efficacy of identifying early-stage neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid assessment and positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer imaging. These methods are effective yet are invasive, expensive, and not widely accessible. We extend and improve the multiscale structural mapping (MSSM) procedure to develop structural indicators of β-amyloid neuropathology in preclinical AD, by capturing both macrostructural and microstructural properties throughout the cerebral cortex using a structural MRI. We find that the MSSM signal is regionally altered in clear positive and negative cases of preclinical amyloid pathology (N = 220) when cortical thickness alone or hippocampal volume is not. It exhibits widespread effects of amyloid positivity across the posterior temporal, parietal, and medial prefrontal cortex, surprisingly consistent with the typical pattern of amyloid deposition. The MSSM signal is significantly correlated with amyloid PET in almost half of the cortex, much of which overlaps with regions where beta-amyloid accumulates, suggesting it could provide a regional brain 'map' that is not available from systemic markers such as plasma markers.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta neuropathology; Gray matter to white matter contrast; MRI; Machine learning; PET,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Amyloid,"Jang, I; Li, B; Rashid, B; Jacoby, J; Huang, SY; Dickerson, BC; Salat, DH"

Ceftriaxone Modulates Ubiquitination of α-Amino-3-Hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-Isoxazole Propionic Acid Receptors to Improve Long-Term Potentiation Impairment Induced by Exogenous β-Amyloid in a Glutamate Transporter-1 Dependent Manner.,"Α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are crucial for properties of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP impairment can occur early in the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The downregulation or decreased abundance of AMPAR expression in the postsynaptic membrane is closely associated with LTP impairment. Ceftriaxone (Cef) can improve LTP impairment in the early stages of AD in a mouse model. The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism underlying this process from the aspects of AMPAR expression and ubiquitination degree. In this study, we found that β-amyloid (Aβ) treatment induced hippocampal LTP impairment and AMPAR downregulation and ubiquitination. Cef pretreatment ameliorated Aβ-induced hippocampal LTP impairment, reduced AMPAR ubiquitination, and increased AMPAR expression, especially in the plasma membrane, in Aβ-treated mice. Administration of USP46 siRNA and DHK (a specific blocker of glutamate transporter-1) significantly inhibited the above effects of Cef, suggesting a role for anti-AMPAR ubiquitination and upregulation of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) in the Cef-induced improvements mentioned above. The above findings demonstrate that pretreatment with Cef effectively mitigated Aβ-induced impairment of hippocampal LTP by suppressing the ubiquitination process of AMPARs in a GLT-1-dependent manner. These results provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms elucidating the anti-AD by Cef.",2024,AMPAR; Alzheimer’s disease; GLT-1; NEDD4; USP46; Ubiquitination,,"Jiang, R; Li, L; Wang, B; Liu, L; Liu, L; Xian, X; Li, W"

Present and Future of Blood-Based Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease: Beyond the Classics.,"The field of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has advanced at an incredible pace, especially after the development of sensitive analytic platforms that can facilitate large-scale screening. Such screening will be important when more sophisticated diagnostic methods are scarce and expensive. Thus, blood-based biomarkers can potentially reduce diagnosis inequities among populations from different socioeconomic contexts. This large-scale screening can be performed so that older adults at risk of cognitive decline assessed using these methods can then undergo more complete assessments with classic biomarkers, increasing diagnosis efficiency and reducing costs to the health systems. Blood-based biomarkers can also aid in assessing the effect of new disease-modifying treatments. This paper reviews recent advances in the area, focusing on the following leading candidates for blood-based biomarkers: amyloid-beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau isoforms (p-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic (GFAP) proteins, as well as on new candidates, Neuron-Derived Exosomes contents (NDEs) and Transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), based on data from longitudinal observational cohort studies. The underlying challenges of validating and incorporating these biomarkers into routine clinical practice and primary care settings are also discussed. Importantly, challenges related to the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged persons must be considered. If these challenges are overcome, a new time of cost-effective blood-based biomarkers for AD could represent the future of clinical procedures in the field and, together with continued prevention strategies, the beginning of an era with a lower incidence of dementia worldwide.",2024,Alzheimer disease; Biomarker; Blood; Cognition; Dementia; Plasma,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Biomarkers; tau Proteins,"Mantellatto Grigoli, M; Pelegrini, LNC; Whelan, R; Cominetti, MR"
Surface-functionalized SERS platform for deep learning-assisted diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to stall the deterioration of brain function, but conventional diagnostic methods require complicated analytical procedures or inflict acute pain on the patient. Then, label-free Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis of blood-based biomarkers is a convenient alternative to rapidly obtain spectral information from biofluids. However, despite the rapid acquisition of spectral information from biofluids, it is challenging to distinguish spectral features of biomarkers due to interference from biofluidic components. Here, we introduce a deep learning-assisted, SERS-based platform for separate analysis of blood-based amyloid β (1-42) and metabolites, enabling the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. SERS substrates consisting of Au nanowire arrays are fabricated and functionalized in two characteristic ways to compare the validity of different Alzheimer's disease biomarkers measured on our SERS system. The 6E10 antibody is immobilized for the capture of amyloid β (1-42) and analysis of its oligomerization process, while various self-assembled monolayers are attached for different dipole interactions with blood-based metabolites. Ultimately, SERS spectra of blood plasma of Alzheimer's disease patients and human controls are measured on the substrates and classified via advanced deep learning techniques that automatically extract informative features to learn generalizable representations. Accuracies up to 99.5% are achieved for metabolite-based analyses, which are verified with an explainable artificial intelligence technique that identifies key spectral features used for classification and for deducing significant biomarkers.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Blood-based biomarker; Deep learning; Gold nanowire array; Label-free diagnosis; Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Biosensing Techniques; Metal Nanoparticles; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Biomarkers","Kim, M; Huh, S; Park, HJ; Cho, SH; Lee, MY; Jo, S; Jung, YS"

Life course plasma metabolomic signatures of genetic liability to Alzheimer's disease.,"Mechanisms through which most known Alzheimer's disease (AD) loci operate to increase AD risk remain unclear. Although Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is known to regulate lipid homeostasis, the effects of broader AD genetic liability on non-lipid metabolites remain unknown, and the earliest ages at which metabolic perturbations occur and how these change over time are yet to be elucidated. We examined the effects of AD genetic liability on the plasma metabolome across the life course. Using a reverse Mendelian randomization framework in two population-based cohorts [Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, n = 5648) and UK Biobank (n ≤ 118,466)], we estimated the effects of genetic liability to AD on 229 plasma metabolites, at seven different life stages, spanning 8 to 73 years. We also compared the specific effects of APOE ε4 and APOE ε2 carriage on metabolites. In ALSPAC, AD genetic liability demonstrated the strongest positive associations with cholesterol-related traits, with similar magnitudes of association observed across all age groups including in childhood. In UK Biobank, the effect of AD liability on several lipid traits decreased with age. Fatty acid metabolites demonstrated positive associations with AD liability in both cohorts, though with smaller magnitudes than lipid traits. Sensitivity analyses indicated that observed effects are largely driven by the strongest AD instrument, APOE, with many contrasting effects observed on lipids and fatty acids for both ε4 and ε2 carriage.

Plasma N-terminal containing tau fragments (NTA-tau): a biomarker of tau deposition in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Novel phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) blood biomarkers (e.g., p-tau181, p-tau217 or p-tau231), are highly specific for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and can track amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology. However, because these biomarkers are strongly associated with the emergence of Aβ pathology, it is difficult to determine the contribution of insoluble tau aggregates to the plasma p-tau signal in blood. Therefore, there remains a need for a biomarker capable of specifically tracking insoluble tau accumulation in brain.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; BioFINDER; Biomarkers; NTA; NTA-tau; Plasma; Tau; Tau pathology; Tau-PET,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Atrophy; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Positron-Emission Tomography,"Lantero-Rodriguez, J; Salvadó, G; Snellman, A; Montoliu-Gaya, L; Brum, WS; Benedet, AL; Mattsson-Carlgren, N; Tideman, P; Janelidze, S; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Ashton, NJ; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Hansson, O"
The miR-25802/KLF4/NF-κB signaling axis regulates microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the occurrence and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, studies have increasingly explored microRNAs as biomarkers and treatment interventions for AD. This study identified a novel microRNA termed miR-25802 from our high-throughput sequencing dataset of an AD model and explored its role and the underlying mechanism. The results confirmed the miRNA properties of miR-25802 based on bioinformatics and experimental verification. Expression of miR-25802 was increased in the plasma of AD patients and in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 and 5 × FAD mice carrying two and five familial AD gene mutations. Functional studies suggested that overexpression or inhibition of miR-25802 respectively aggravated or ameliorated AD-related pathology, including cognitive disability, Aβ deposition, microglial pro-inflammatory phenotype activation, and neuroinflammation, in 5 × FAD mice and homeostatic or LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated EOC20 microglia. Mechanistically, miR-25802 negatively regulates KLF4 by directly binding to KLF4 mRNA, thus stimulating microglia polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype by promoting the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. The results also showed that inhibition of miR-25802 increased microglial anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype activity and suppressed NF-κB-mediated inflammatory reactions in the brains of 5 × FAD mice, while overexpression of miR-25802 exacerbated microglial pro-inflammatory M1 activity by enhancing NF-κB pathways. Of note, AD-associated manifestations induced by inhibition or overexpression of miR-25802 via the NF-κB signaling pathway were reversed by KLF4 silencing or upregulation. Collectively, these results provide the first evidence that miR-25802 is a regulator of microglial activity and establish the role of miR-25802/KLF4/NF-κB signaling in microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Krüppel-like factor 4; Microglia; Neuroinflammation; microRNA-25802,Humans; Mice; Animals; NF-kappa B; Alzheimer Disease; Microglia; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Signal Transduction; MicroRNAs,"Zhao, K; Liu, J; Sun, T; Zeng, L; Cai, Z; Li, Z; Liu, R"

"The relationship of salusins with Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, and acute ischemic stroke: A preliminary study.","Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis play important roles in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS). Salusin-α and salusin-β peptides, which were shown to be present in many tissues, including the central nervous system, were also shown to be associated with apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In the present study, the relationship between Salusin-α and salusin-β peptides and AD, PD, and AIS were investigated. A total of 179 people were included in the present study, including 46 AD, 44 PD, 42 AIS, and 47 controls. Plasma Salusin-α and salusin-β levels were measured with the ELISA Method. The plasma salusin-β levels of AD, PD, and AIS patients were lower than the control group at significant levels (p < 0.05). It was also found that there were correlations between salusin-α and salusin-β levels and age, triglyceride, LDL-c, total cholesterol, and hemoglobin levels. In this study, we found that salusin- β, an endogenous neuropeptide, was associated with AD, PD and AIS. The low level of salusin-β in these diseases in which neuronal damage occurs may be related to the neuroprotective properties of this endogenous peptide. Further studies are needed to fully understand the relationship between salusin-β and the pathophysiology of these diseases.",2024,Acute Ischemic Stroke; Alzheimer’s Disease; Parkinson’s Disease; Salusin-α; Salusin-β,Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Parkinson Disease; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Inflammation,"Çakır, M; Saçmacı, H"

Single-molecule imaging of Tau reveals how phosphorylation affects its movement and confinement in living cells.,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is regulated by post-translational modifications. The most studied of these modifications is phosphorylation, which affects Tau's aggregation and loss- and gain-of-functions, including the interaction with microtubules, in Alzheimer's disease and primary tauopathies. However, little is known about how Tau's phosphorylation state affects its dynamics and organisation at the single-molecule level. Here, using quantitative single-molecule localisation microscopy, we examined how mimicking or abrogating phosphorylation at 14 disease-associated serine and threonine residues through mutagenesis influences the behaviour of Tau in live Neuro-2a cells.

Plasma proteomic profiles predict future dementia in healthy adults.,"The advent of proteomics offers an unprecedented opportunity to predict dementia onset. We examined this in data from 52,645 adults without dementia in the UK Biobank, with 1,417 incident cases and a follow-up time of 14.1 years. Of 1,463 plasma proteins, GFAP, NEFL, GDF15 and LTBP2 consistently associated most with incident all-cause dementia (ACD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), and ranked high in protein importance ordering. Combining GFAP (or GDF15) with demographics produced desirable predictions for ACD (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.891) and AD (AUC = 0.872) (or VaD (AUC = 0.912)). This was also true when predicting over 10-year ACD, AD and VaD. Individuals with higher GFAP levels were 2.32 times more likely to develop dementia. Notably, GFAP and LTBP2 were highly specific for dementia prediction. GFAP and NEFL began to change at least 10 years before dementia diagnosis. Our findings strongly highlight GFAP as an optimal biomarker for dementia prediction, even more than 10 years before the diagnosis, with implications for screening people at high risk for dementia and for early intervention.",2024,,"Humans; Proteomics; Alzheimer Disease; Dementia, Vascular; Latent TGF-beta Binding Proteins","Guo, Y; You, J; Zhang, Y; Liu, WS; Huang, YY; Zhang, YR; Zhang, W; Dong, Q; Feng, JF; Cheng, W; Yu, JT"

Identification of binding partners that facilitate membrane-type 5 matrix metalloproteinase (MT5-MMP) processing of amyloid precursor protein.,"One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of extracellular deposits of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. In addition to Aβ as the core component of the amyloid plaque, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing fragment Aβ was also found accumulated around the plaque. The APPη pathway, mainly mediated by membrane-type 5 matrix metalloproteinase (MT5-MMP), represents an important factor in AD pathogenesis. The proamyloidogenic features of MT5-MMP could result from interactions with APP when trafficking between organelles, so determination of the location within the cell of APPη cleavage and interacting proteins of MT5-MMP affecting this process will be of priority in understanding the role of MT5-MMP in AD. In the present study, MT5-MMP was found to be located in the nucleus, cytosol, and cytosolic subcellular granules of CHO cells that stably expressed wild-type human APP751. MT5-MMP fusion proteins were constructed that could localize enzyme production in the Golgi apparatus, endosome, ER, mitochondria, or plasma membrane. The fusion proteins significantly increased sAPPη when directed to the endosome, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, or mitochondria. Since the C-terminal region of MT5-MMP is responsible for its intracellular location and trafficking, this domain was used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify MT5-MMP protein partners in a human brain cDNA library. Identified binding partners included N4BP2L1, TMX3, EIG121, bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1), RUFY4, HTRA1, and TMEM199. The binding of N4BP2L1, EIG121, BIN1, or TMX3 to MT5-MMP resulted in the most significant increase in sAPPη production. Thus, the action of MT5-MMP on APP occurs in multiple locations within the cell and is facilitated by site-specific binding partners.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; amyloid precursor protein; intracellular proteolysis; membrane‐type 5 matrix metalloproteinase; secretase,"Animals; Humans; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Cell Membrane; CHO Cells; Cricetulus; Matrix Metalloproteinases, Membrane-Associated; Nuclear Proteins; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Cricetinae","Wang, H; Lakshmana, MK; Fields, GB"
Longitudinal progression of blood biomarkers reveals a key role of astrocyte reactivity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Defining the progression of blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for targeting treatments in patients most likely to benefit from early intervention. We delineated the temporal ordering of blood biomarkers a decade prior to the onset of AD symptoms in participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We show that increased astrocyte reactivity, assessed by elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels is an early event in the progression of blood biomarker changes in preclinical AD. In AD-converters who are initially cognitively unimpaired (N=158, 377 serial plasma samples), higher plasma GFAP levels are observed as early as 10-years prior to the onset of cognitive impairment due to incident AD compared to individuals who remain cognitively unimpaired (CU, N=160, 379 serial plasma samples). Plasma GFAP levels in AD-converters remain elevated 5-years prior to and coincident with the onset of cognitive impairment due to AD. In participants with neuropathologically confirmed AD, plasma GFAP levels are elevated relative to cognitively normal individuals and intermediate in those who remain cognitively unimpaired despite significant AD pathology (asymptomatic AD). Higher plasma GFAP levels at death are associated with greater severity of both neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In the 5XFAD transgenic model of AD, we observed greater GFAP levels in the cortex and hippocampus of transgenic mice relative to wild-type prior to the development of cognitive impairment. Reactive astrocytosis, an established biological response to neuronal injury, may be an early initiator of AD pathogenesis and a promising therapeutic target.",2024,,,"Varma, VR; An, Y; Kac, PR; Bilgel, M; Moghekar, A; Loeffler, T; Amschl, D; Troncoso, J; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Ashton, NJ; Resnick, SM; Thambisetty, M"
Characteristics of discordance between amyloid positron emission tomography and plasma amyloid-β 42/40 positivity.,"Various plasma biomarkers for amyloid-β (Aβ) have shown high predictability of amyloid PET positivity. However, the characteristics of discordance between amyloid PET and plasma Aβ42/40 positivity are poorly understood. Thorough interpretation of discordant cases is vital as Aβ plasma biomarker is imminent to integrate into clinical guidelines. We aimed to determine the characteristics of discordant groups between amyloid PET and plasma Aβ42/40 positivity, and inter-assays variability depending on plasma assays. We compared tau burden measured by PET, brain volume assessed by MRI, cross-sectional cognitive function, longitudinal cognitive decline and polygenic risk score (PRS) between PET/plasma groups (PET-/plasma-, PET-/plasma+, PET+/plasma-, PET+/plasma+) using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Additionally, we investigated inter-assays variability between immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry method developed at Washington University (IP-MS-WashU) and Elecsys immunoassay from Roche (IA-Elc). PET+/plasma+ was significantly associated with higher tau burden assessed by PET in entorhinal, Braak III/IV, and Braak V/VI regions, and with decreased volume of hippocampal and precuneus regions compared to PET-/plasma-. PET+/plasma+ showed poor performances in global cognition, memory, executive and daily-life function, and rapid cognitive decline. PET+/plasma+ was related to high PRS. The PET-/plasma+ showed intermediate changes between PET-/plasma- and PET+/plasma+ in terms of tau burden, hippocampal and precuneus volume, cross-sectional and longitudinal cognition, and PRS. PET+/plasma- represented heterogeneous characteristics with most prominent variability depending on plasma assays. Moreover, IP-MS-WashU showed more linear association between amyloid PET standardized uptake value ratio and plasma Aβ42/40 than IA-Elc. IA-Elc showed more plasma Aβ42/40 positivity in the amyloid PET-negative stage than IP-MS-WashU. Characteristics of PET-/plasma+ support plasma biomarkers as early biomarker of amyloidopathy prior to amyloid PET.

"Influence of Physiological Variables and Comorbidities on Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 Levels in Cognitively Unimpaired Individuals.","Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a promising tool that may help in early diagnosis. However, their levels may be influenced by physiological parameters and comorbidities that should be considered before they can be used at the population level. For this purpose, we assessed the influences of different comorbidities on AD plasma markers in 208 cognitively unimpaired subjects. We analyzed both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 using the fully automated Lumipulse platform. The relationships between the different plasma markers and physiological variables were studied using linear regression models. The mean differences in plasma markers according to comorbidity groups were also studied. The glomerular filtration rate showed an influence on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The amyloid ratio was significantly lower in diabetic and hypertensive subjects, and the mean p-tau181 levels were higher in hypertensive subjects. The glomerular filtration rate may have an inverse relationship on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the amyloid ratio, suggesting that the latter is a more stable marker to use in the general population. Cardiovascular risk factors might have a long-term effect on the amyloid ratio and plasma levels of p-tau181.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; comorbidities; plasma biomarkers; presymptomatic stages; tau protein,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Comorbidity; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Martínez-Dubarbie, F; Guerra-Ruiz, A; López-García, S; Irure-Ventura, J; Lage, C; Fernández-Matarrubia, M; Pozueta-Cantudo, A; García-Martínez, M; Corrales-Pardo, A; Bravo, M; Martín-Arroyo, J; Infante, J; López-Hoyos, M; García-Unzueta, MT; Sánchez-Juan, P; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, E"
Association of Plasma Claudin-5 with Age and Alzheimer Disease.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays pivotal roles in synaptic and neuronal functioning by sealing the space between adjacent microvascular endothelial cells. BBB breakdown is present in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer disease (AD). Claudin-5 (CLDN-5) is a tetra-spanning protein essential for sealing the intercellular space between adjacent endothelial cells in the BBB. In this study, we developed a blood-based assay for CLDN-5 and investigated its diagnostic utility using 100 cognitively normal (control) subjects, 100 patients with MCI, and 100 patients with AD. Plasma CLDN-5 levels were increased in patients with AD (3.08 ng/mL) compared with controls (2.77 ng/mL). Plasma levels of phosphorylated tau (pTau181), a biomarker of pathological tau, were elevated in patients with MCI or AD (2.86 and 4.20 pg/mL, respectively) compared with control subjects (1.81 pg/mL). In patients with MCI or AD, plasma levels of CLDN-5-but not pTau181-decreased with age, suggesting some age-dependent BBB changes in MCI and AD.

Small RNA Changes in Plasma Have Potential for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease before Symptom Onset.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to its multifactorial nature and complex etiology, poses challenges for research, diagnosis, and treatment, and impacts millions worldwide. To address the need for minimally invasive, repeatable measures that aid in AD diagnosis and progression monitoring, studies leveraging RNAs associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) in human biofluids have revealed AD-associated changes. However, the validation of AD biomarkers has suffered from the collection of samples from differing points in the disease time course or a lack of confirmed AD diagnoses. Here, we integrate clinical diagnosis and postmortem pathology data to form more accurate experimental groups and use small RNA sequencing to show that EVs from plasma can serve as a potential source of RNAs that reflect disease-related changes. Importantly, we demonstrated that these changes are identifiable in the EVs of preclinical patients, years before symptom manifestation, and that machine learning models based on differentially expressed RNAs can help predict disease conversion or progression.

Factors acting upstream of Aβ/pTau in AD remain unknown, but their identification could enable earlier diagnosis and more effective treatments. T cell abnormalities are emerging AD hallmarks, and CD8 T cells were recently found to mediate neurodegeneration downstream of tangle deposition in hereditary neurodegeneration models.

SELENOK-dependent CD36 palmitoylation regulates microglial functions and Aβ phagocytosis.,"Amyloid-beta (Aβ) is a key factor in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Selenium (Se) compounds show promise in AD treatment. Here, we revealed that selenoprotein K (SELENOK), a selenoprotein involved in immune regulation and potentially related to AD pathology, plays a critical role in microglial immune response, migration, and phagocytosis. In vivo and in vitro studies corroborated that SELENOK deficiency inhibits microglial Aβ phagocytosis, exacerbating cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice, which are reversed by SELENOK overexpression. Mechanistically, SELENOK is involved in CD36 palmitoylation through DHHC6, regulating CD36 localization to microglial plasma membranes and thus impacting Aβ phagocytosis. CD36 palmitoylation was reduced in the brains of patients and mice with AD. Se supplementation promoted SELENOK expression and CD36 palmitoylation, enhancing microglial Aβ phagocytosis and mitigating AD progression. We have identified the regulatory mechanisms from Se-dependent selenoproteins to Aβ pathology, providing novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving Se and selenoproteins.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-beta; CD36 palmitoylation; Microglial phagocytosis; Selenoprotein K,"Animals; Humans; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Models, Animal; Lipoylation; Mice, Transgenic; Microglia; Phagocytosis; Selenoproteins; CD36 Antigens","Ouyang, P; Cai, Z; Peng, J; Lin, S; Chen, X; Chen, C; Feng, Z; Wang, L; Song, G; Zhang, Z"

Assessment of immunoprecipitation with subsequent immunoassays for the blood-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"The Aβ42/40 ratio and the concentration of phosphorylated Tau181 in blood plasma represent attractive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. As a means for reducing potential matrix effects, which may interfere with plasma immunoassays, we have previously developed a pre-analytical sample workup by semi-automated immunoprecipitation. Here we test the compatibility of pre-analytical immunoprecipitations with automated Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and phosphorylated Tau181 immunoassays on the Lumipulse platform and compare the diagnostic performance of the respective immunoprecipitation immunoassay approaches with direct plasma measurements. 71 participants were dichotomized according to their Aβ42/40 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid into the diagnostic groups amyloid-positive (n = 32) and amyloid-negative (n = 39). The plasma Aβ1-42/1-40 ratio and phosphorylated Tau181 levels were determined on the Lumipulse G600II platform (Fujirebio) by direct measurements in EDTA-plasma or after Aβ- or Tau-immunoprecipitation, respectively. Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation of Aβ turned out to be compatible with the Lumipulse Aβ assays and resulted in a numerical, yet statistically not significant increase in the area under the ROC curve for plasma Aβ1-42/1-40. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the standardised effect size (Cohen's D). Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation of Tau resulted in increased differences between the diagnostic groups in terms of median and mean phosphorylated Tau 181 levels. Furthermore, we observed a greater Cohen's d (p < 0.001) and a larger area under the ROC curve (p = 0.038) after Tau-IP. Our preliminary findings in a small, preselected sample indicate that pre-analytical immunoprecipitation may have the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarker immunoassays for Aβ1-42/1-40 and phosphorylated Tau181 to predict brain amyloid deposition.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta; Biomarker; Blood plasma; Tau,,"Morgado, B; Klafki, HW; Bauer, C; Waniek, K; Esselmann, H; Wirths, O; Hansen, N; Lachmann, I; Osterloh, D; Schuchhardt, J; Wiltfang, J"

Plasma VEGFA and PGF impact longitudinal tau and cognition in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Vascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways have been implicated as potential mechanisms. However, the specific impact of VEGF proteins in preclinical Alzheimer's disease and their relationships with other Alzheimer's disease and vascular pathologies during this critical early period remain to be elucidated. We included 317 older adults from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a cohort of individuals who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline and followed longitudinally for up to 12 years. Baseline VEGF family protein levels (VEGFA, VEGFC, VEGFD, PGF and FLT1) were measured in fasting plasma using high-sensitivity immunoassays. Using linear mixed effects models, we examined the interactive effects of baseline plasma VEGF proteins and amyloid PET burden (Pittsburgh Compound-B) on longitudinal cognition (Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite-5). We further investigated if effects on cognition were mediated by early neocortical tau accumulation (flortaucipir PET burden in the inferior temporal cortex) or hippocampal atrophy. Lastly, we examined the impact of adjusting for baseline cardiovascular risk score or white matter hyperintensity volume. Baseline plasma VEGFA and PGF each showed a significant interaction with amyloid burden on prospective cognitive decline. Specifically, low VEGFA and high PGF were associated with greater cognitive decline in individuals with elevated amyloid, i.e. those on the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Concordantly, low VEGFA and high PGF were associated with accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation in those with elevated amyloid. Moderated mediation analyses confirmed that accelerated tau accumulation fully mediated the effects of low VEGFA and partially mediated (31%) the effects of high PGF on faster amyloid-related cognitive decline. The effects of VEGFA and PGF on tau and cognition remained significant after adjusting for cardiovascular risk score or white matter hyperintensity volume. There were concordant but non-significant associations with longitudinal hippocampal atrophy. Together, our findings implicate low VEGFA and high PGF in accelerating early neocortical tau pathology and cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, our results underscore the potential of these minimally-invasive plasma biomarkers to inform the risk of Alzheimer's disease progression in the preclinical population. Importantly, VEGFA and PGF appear to capture distinct effects from vascular risks and cerebrovascular injury. This highlights their potential as new therapeutic targets, in combination with anti-amyloid and traditional vascular risk reduction therapies, to slow the trajectory of preclinical Alzheimer's disease and delay or prevent the onset of cognitive decline.",2024,VCID; angiogenesis; biomarker; dementia,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Male; Female; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Aged; tau Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Positron-Emission Tomography; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers","Yang, HS; Yau, WW; Carlyle, BC; Trombetta, BA; Zhang, C; Shirzadi, Z; Schultz, AP; Pruzin, JJ; Fitzpatrick, CD; Kirn, DR; Rabin, JS; Buckley, RF; Hohman, TJ; Rentz, DM; Tanzi, RE; Johnson, KA; Sperling, RA; Arnold, SE; Chhatwal, JP"

Distinct plasma phosphorylated-tau proteins profiling for the differential diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease by plasmonic asymmetric nanobridge-based biosensor.,"The differential diagnosis between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been highly demanded for its effectiveness in preventing and contributing to early diagnosis of AD. To this end, we developed a single plasmonic asymmetric nanobridge (PAN)-based biosensor to differentially diagnose MCI and AD by quantitative profiling of phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau) in clinical plasma samples, which revealed a significant correlation with AD development and progression. The PAN was designed to have a conductive junction and asymmetric structure, which was unable to be synthesized by the traditional thermodynamical methods. For its unique morphological characteristics, PAN features high electromagnetic field enhancement, enabling the biosensor to achieve high sensitivity, with a limit of detection in the attomolar regime for quantitative analysis of p-tau. By introducing support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning algorithm, the improved diagnostic system was achieved for prediction of healthy controls, MCI, and AD groups with an accuracy of 94.47 % by detecting various p-tau species levels in human plasma. Thus, our proposed PAN-based plasmonic biosensor has a powerful potential in clinical utility for predicting the onset of AD progression in the asymptomatic phase.",2024,Alzheimer's disease (AD); Differential diagnosis; Gold nanoparticles; Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Phosphorylated-tau proteins; Plasmonic biosensors,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Diagnosis, Differential; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; Cognitive Dysfunction","Kim, S; Ma, X; Jeon, MJ; Song, S; Lee, JS; Lee, JU; Lee, CN; Choi, SH; Sim, SJ"

"Cardiometabolic risk factors and neurodegeneration: a review of the mechanisms underlying diabetes, obesity and hypertension in Alzheimer's disease.","A growing body of evidence suggests that cardiometabolic risk factors play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diabetes, obesity and hypertension are highly prevalent and can accelerate neurodegeneration and perpetuate the burden of AD. Insulin resistance and enzymes including insulin degrading enzymes are implicated in AD where breakdown of insulin is prioritised over amyloid-β. Leptin resistance and inflammation demonstrated by higher plasma and central nervous system levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α, are mechanisms connecting obesity and diabetes with AD. Leptin has been shown to ameliorate AD pathology and enhance long-term potentiation and hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. The renin-aldosterone angiotensin system, involved in hypertension, has been associated with AD pathology and neurotoxic reactive oxygen species, where angiotensin binds to specific angiotensin-1 receptors in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.

The role of ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) in Alzheimer's disease: A review of the mechanisms.,"The maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis is essential for central nervous system function. Consequently, factors that affect cholesterol homeostasis are linked to neurological disorders and pathologies. Among them, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) plays a significant role in atherosclerosis. However, its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. There is inconsistent information regarding ABCG1's role in AD. It can increase or decrease amyloid β (Aβ) levels in animals' brains. Clinical studies show that ABCG1 is involved in AD patients' impairment of cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Lower Aβ levels in the CSF are correlated with ABCG1-mediated CEC dysfunction. ABCG1 modulates α-, β-, and γ-secretase activities in the plasma membrane and may affect Aβ production in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM) cell compartment. Despite contradictory findings regarding ABCG1's role in AD, this review shows that ABCG1 has a role in Aβ generation via modulation of membrane secretases. It is, however, necessary to investigate the underlying mechanism(s). ABCG1 may also contribute to AD pathology through its role in apoptosis and oxidative stress. As a result, ABCG1 plays a role in AD and is a candidate for drug development.",2024,ABC transporters; ABCG1; Alzheimer's disease; Cholesterol; beta secretase,"Animals; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Brain; Cholesterol; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1","Yazdi, MK; Alavi, MS; Roohbakhsh, A"
Analysis of the longitudinal stability of human plasma miRNAs and implications for disease biomarkers.,"There is great interest in developing clinical biomarker assays that can aid in non-invasive diagnosis and/or monitoring of human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological diseases. Yet little is known about the longitudinal stability of miRNAs in human plasma. Here we assessed the intraindividual longitudinal stability of miRNAs in plasma from healthy human adults, and the impact of common factors (e.g., hemolysis, age) that may confound miRNA data. We collected blood by venipuncture biweekly over a 3-month period from 22 research participants who had fasted overnight, isolated total RNA, then performed miRNA qPCR. Filtering and normalization of the qPCR data revealed amplification of 134 miRNAs, 74 of which had high test-retest reliability and low percentage level drift, meaning they were stable in an individual over the 3-month time period. We also determined that, of nuisance factors, hemolysis and tobacco use have the greatest impact on miRNA levels and variance. These findings support that many miRNAs show intraindividual longitudinal stability in plasma from healthy human adults, including some reported as candidate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.",2024,,Adult; Humans; MicroRNAs; Hemolysis; Reproducibility of Results; Plasma; Biomarkers,"Sandau, US; Wiedrick, JT; McFarland, TJ; Galasko, DR; Fanning, Z; Quinn, JF; Saugstad, JA"

Differential diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's disease by Simoa p-tau181 measurements with matching plasma and CSF.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long preclinical phase. Although late-stage AD/dementia may be robustly differentiated from cognitively normal individuals by means of a clinical evaluation, PET imaging, and established biofluid biomarkers, disease differentiation between cognitively normal and various subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a challenging task. Differential biomarkers for early-stage AD diagnosis with accessible biofluid samples are urgently needed. Misfolded phosphorylated tau aggregates (p-tau) are present in multiple neurodegenerative diseases known as ""tauopathies"", with the most common being AD. P-tau181 is a well-established p-tau biomarker to differentiate AD dementia from non-AD pathology. However, it is unclear if p-tau181 is capable of diagnosing MCI, an early AD stage, from cognitively normal subjects, or if it can discriminate MCI subtypes amnestic MCI (aMCI) from non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). Here we evaluated the capability of p-tau181 in diagnosing MCI from cognitively normal subjects and discriminating aMCI from naMCI subtypes. We collected matching plasma and CSF samples of a clinically diagnosed cohort of 35 cognitively normal, 34 aMCI, 17 naMCI, and 31 AD dementia cases (total 117 participants) with supplemental CSF Aβ42 and total tau AD biomarker levels and performed Simoa p-tau181 assays. The diagnostic capabilities of Simoa p-tau181 assays to differentiate these cohorts were evaluated. We found (i) p-tau181 can robustly differentiate MCI or aMCI from cognitively normal cohorts with matching plasma and CSF samples, but such differentiation is weaker in diagnosing naMCI from cognitively normal groups, (ii) p-tau181 is not capable of differentiating aMCI from naMCI cohorts, and (iii) either factor of Aβ or total tau burden markedly improved differentiation power to diagnose aMCI from cognitively normal group. Plasma and CSF p-tau181 levels may serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosing aMCI from normal controls in the preclinical phase. But more robust new biomarkers are needed to differentiate naMCI from cognitively normal cases or to discriminate between MCI subtypes, aMCI from naMCI.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; early diagnosis; matching plasma and CSF pre-mortem samples; mild cognitive impairment; p-tau181 biomarker,,"Wu, L; Arvai, S; Wang, SJ; Liu, AJ; Xu, B"

Identification of Novel Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Using Unbiased Plasma Proteomics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is a complex disease with multiple pathophysiological drivers that determine clinical symptomology and disease progression. These diseases develop insidiously over time, through many pathways and disease mechanisms and continue to have a huge societal impact for affected individuals and their families. While emerging blood-based biomarkers, such as plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217, accurately detect Alzheimer neuropthology and are associated with faster cognitive decline, the full extension of plasma proteomic changes in ADRD remains unknown. Earlier detection and better classification of the different subtypes may provide opportunities for earlier, more targeted interventions, and perhaps a higher likelihood of successful therapeutic development. In this study, we aim to leverage unbiased mass spectrometry proteomics to identify novel, blood-based biomarkers associated with cognitive decline. 1,786 plasma samples from 1,005 patients were collected over 12 years from partcipants in the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Longitudinal Cohort Study.

Proteomic Changes in the Human Cerebrovasculature in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Tauopathies Linked to Peripheral Biomarkers in Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid.,"Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Tandem mass tag labeling; amyloid; biomarkers; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; cerebrovasculature; mass spectrometry; progressive supranuclear palsy; tau,,"Wojtas, AM; Dammer, EB; Guo, Q; Ping, L; Shantaraman, A; Duong, DM; Yin, L; Fox, EJ; Seifar, F; Lee, EB; Johnson, ECB; Lah, JJ; Levey, AI; Levites, Y; Rangaraju, S; Golde, TE; Seyfried, NT"

Older people with HIV (PWH) are also at risk for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). β-amyloid (Aβ) and Tau biomarkers are associated with aMCI/AD, but their relationship to HAND is unclear. Given the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in age-related neurological disorders, we investigated soluble and EV-associated Aβ42, total Tau, NFL, GFAP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP in relation to cognitive impairment in PWH. Plasma and CSF EVs were isolated from 184 participants (98 PWH on ART and 86 HIV- controls). Biomarkers were measured using Meso Scale Discovery assays.

Definition of a Threshold for the Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 Ratio Measured by Single-Molecule Array to Predict the Amyloid Status of Individuals without Dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Aβ plaques precede cognitive impairments and can be detected through amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) or in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Assessing the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio seems promising for non-invasive and cost-effective detection of brain Aβ accumulation. This approach involves some challenges, including the accuracy of blood-based biomarker measurements and the establishment of clear, standardized thresholds to categorize the risk of developing brain amyloid pathology.

A Cross-Sectional Study of Alzheimer-Related Proteins in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition in women of reproductive age, and several risk factors found in PCOS are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Proteins increased in AD have been reported to include fibronectin (FN) fragments 3 and 4 (FN1.3 and FN1.4, respectively) and ApoE. We hypothesized that Alzheimer-related proteins would be dysregulated in PCOS because of associated insulin resistance and obesity.

"Autophagy Markers Are Altered in Alzheimer's Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Frontotemporal Dementia.","The accumulation of protein aggregates defines distinct, yet overlapping pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In this study, we investigated ATG5, UBQLN2, ULK1, and LC3 concentrations in 66 brain specimens and 120 plasma samples from AD, DLB, FTD, and control subjects (CTRL). Protein concentration was measured with ELISA kits in temporal, frontal, and occipital cortex specimens of 32 AD, 10 DLB, 10 FTD, and 14 CTRL, and in plasma samples of 30 AD, 30 DLB, 30 FTD, and 30 CTRL.

In this study, we demonstrate alterations in different steps related to ATG5, UBQLN2, and LC3 autophagy pathways in DLB and FTD patients.

Oxidative stress is associated with Aβ accumulation in chronic sleep deprivation model.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation is the main pathological change in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which results from the imbalance of production and clearance of Aβ in the brain. Our previous study found that chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) led to the deposition of Aβ in the brain by disrupting the balance of Aβ production and clearance, but the specific mechanism was not clear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of oxidative stress on Aβ accumulation in CSD rats. We found that the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly increased after CSD, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased in the brain. Furthermore, the serum ROS was elevated and SOD declined after CSD. The levels of oxidative stress in the brain were significantly correlated with β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), and receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) levels in hippocampus and prefrontal lobe, and the concentration of serum oxidative mediators were strongly correlated with plasma levels of soluble LRP1 (sLRP1) and soluble RAGE (sRAGE). These results suggested that the oxidative stress in the brain and serum may involved in the CSD-induced Aβ accumulation.

Blood-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease - moving towards a new era of diagnostics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a primary cause of dementia globally, is traditionally diagnosed via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures and positron emission tomography (PET). The invasiveness, cost, and limited accessibility of these methods have led to exploring blood-based biomarkers as a promising alternative for AD diagnosis and monitoring. Recent advancements in sensitive immunoassays have identified potential blood-based biomarkers, such as Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species. This paper briefly evaluates the clinical utility and reliability of these biomarkers across various AD stages, highlighting challenges like refining plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 assays and enhancing the precision of p-tau, particularly p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231. The discussion also covers other plasma biomarkers like neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and synaptic biomarkers, assessing their significance in AD diagnostics. The need for ongoing research and development of robust assays to match the performance of CSF and PET biomarkers is underscored. In summary, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly crucial in AD diagnosis, follow-up, prognostication, treatment response evaluation, and population screening, particularly in primary care settings.

Early modulation of the gut microbiome by female sex hormones alters amyloid pathology and microglial function.,"It is well-established that women are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying this sex-specific disparity are not fully understood, but several factors that are often associated-including interactions of sex hormones, genetic factors, and the gut microbiome-likely contribute to the disease's etiology. Here, we have examined the role of sex hormones and the gut microbiome in mediating Aβ amyloidosis and neuroinflammation in APPPS1-21 mice. We report that postnatal gut microbiome perturbation in female APPPS1-21 mice leads to an elevation in levels of circulating estradiol. Early stage ovariectomy (OVX) leads to a reduction of plasma estradiol that is correlated with a significant alteration of gut microbiome composition and reduction in Aβ pathology. On the other hand, supplementation of OVX-treated animals with estradiol restores Aβ burden and influences gut microbiome composition. The reduction of Aβ pathology with OVX is paralleled by diminished levels of plaque-associated microglia that acquire a neurodegenerative phenotype (MGnD-type) while estradiol supplementation of OVX-treated animals leads to a restoration of activated microglia around plaques. In summary, our investigation elucidates the complex interplay between sex-specific hormonal modulations, gut microbiome dynamics, metabolic perturbations, and microglial functionality in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,,"Male; Female; Humans; Animals; Mice; Microglia; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Estradiol; Plaque, Amyloid","Saha, P; Weigle, IQ; Slimmon, N; Poli, PB; Patel, P; Zhang, X; Cao, Y; Michalkiewicz, J; Gomm, A; Zhang, C; Tanzi, RE; Dylla, N; Al-Hendy, A; Sisodia, SS"

Plasma metabolites distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional metabolomic analysis.,"In multifactorial diseases, alterations in the concentration of metabolites can identify novel pathological mechanisms at the intersection between genetic and environmental influences. This study aimed to profile the plasma metabolome of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), two neurodegenerative disorders for which our understanding of the pathophysiology is incomplete. In the clinical setting, DLB is often mistaken for AD, highlighting a need for accurate diagnostic biomarkers.

Assess Alzheimer's Disease via Plasma Extracellular Vesicle-derived mRNA.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, has emerged as a significant health concern, particularly due to the increasing aging population. Recently, it has been revealed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) originating from neurons play a critical role in AD pathogenesis and progression. These neuronal EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter peripheral circulation, offering a less invasive means for assessing blood-based AD biomarkers. In this study, we analyzed plasma EV-derived messenger RNA (mRNA) from 82 subjects, including individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to profile their gene expression for functional enrichment and pathway analysis. Based on the differentially expressed genes identified in both MCI and AD groups, we established a diagnostic model by implementing a machine learning classifier. The refined model demonstrated an average diagnostic accuracy over 98% and showed a strong correlation with different AD stages, suggesting the potential of plasma EV-derived mRNA as a promising non-invasive biomarker for early detection and ongoing monitoring of AD.",2023,,,"Phu Pham, LH; Chang, CF; Tuchez, K; Chen, Y"

Post-acute COVID-19 neuropsychiatric symptoms are not associated with ongoing nervous system injury.,"A proportion of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 experience a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms months after infection, including cognitive deficits, depression and anxiety. The mechanisms underpinning such symptoms remain elusive. Recent research has demonstrated that nervous system injury can occur during COVID-19. Whether ongoing neural injury in the months after COVID-19 accounts for the ongoing or emergent neuropsychiatric symptoms is unclear. Within a large prospective cohort study of adult survivors who were hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, we analysed plasma markers of nervous system injury and astrocytic activation, measured 6 months post-infection: neurofilament light, glial fibrillary acidic protein and total tau protein. We assessed whether these markers were associated with the severity of the acute COVID-19 illness and with post-acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression, the General Anxiety Disorder assessment for anxiety, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for objective cognitive deficit and the cognitive items of the Patient Symptom Questionnaire for subjective cognitive deficit) at 6 months and 1 year post-hospital discharge from COVID-19. No robust associations were found between markers of nervous system injury and severity of acute COVID-19 (except for an association of small effect size between duration of admission and neurofilament light) nor with post-acute neuropsychiatric symptoms.

This unexpected trend may be explained by age-related lean mass depletion, or methodological issues such as the long preclinical phase of dementia or competing risks. Focusing on preclinical markers of dementia may overcome these issues. Between 2002 and 2005, body composition and plasma total-tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL), amyloid-β40, and amyloid-β42 were measured in 3408 dementia-free participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study. The cross-sectional associations between body composition and plasma markers were determined using linear regression models. Whole body and fat mass, but not lean mass, were positively associated with total-tau, while all these measures were inversely associated with NfL. Apart from an inverse association between lean mass and amyloid-β40, body composition measures were not associated with plasma amyloid-β.

Monitoring synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease through fluid and PET imaging biomarkers: a comprehensive review and future perspectives.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently constrained by limited clinical treatment options. The initial pathophysiological event, which can be traced back to decades before the clinical symptoms become apparent, involves the excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ), a peptide comprised of 40-42 amino acids, in extraneuronal plaques within the brain. Biochemical and histological studies have shown that overaccumulation of Aβ instigates an aberrant escalation in the phosphorylation and secretion of tau, a microtubule-binding axonal protein. The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau into intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles is in turn correlated with microglial dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis, culminating in synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. As neurodegeneration progresses, it gives rise to mild clinical symptoms of AD, which may eventually evolve into overt dementia. Synaptic loss in AD may develop even before tau alteration and in response to possible elevations in soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ associated with early AD. These findings largely rely on post-mortem autopsy examinations, which typically involve a limited number of patients. Over the past decade, a range of fluid biomarkers such as neurogranin, α-synuclein, visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), neuronal pentraxin 2, and β-synuclein, along with positron emission tomography (PET) markers like synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, have been developed. These advancements have facilitated the exploration of how synaptic markers in AD patients correlate with cognitive impairment. However, fluid biomarkers indicating synaptic loss have only been validated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), not in plasma, with the exception of VILIP-1.

Relationship between topological efficiency of white matter structural connectome and plasma biomarkers across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Both plasma biomarkers and brain network topology have shown great potential in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific associations between plasma AD biomarkers, structural network topology, and cognition across the AD continuum have yet to be fully elucidated. This retrospective study evaluated participants from the Sino Longitudinal Study of Cognitive Decline cohort between September 2009 and October 2022 with available blood samples or 3.0-T MRI brain scans. Plasma biomarker levels were measured using the Single Molecule Array platform, including β-amyloid (Aβ), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). The topological structure of brain white matter was assessed using network efficiency. Trend analyses were carried out to evaluate the alterations of the plasma markers and network efficiency with AD progression. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to further explore the relationships among plasma markers, network efficiency, and cognitive performance across the AD continuum.

Prediction of clinical progression in nervous system diseases: plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intracellular type III intermediate filament protein, provides structural support and maintains the mechanical integrity of astrocytes. It is predominantly found in the astrocytes which are the most abundant subtypes of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. As a marker protein of astrocytes, GFAP may exert a variety of physiological effects in neurological diseases. For example, previous published literatures showed that autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, the studies of GFAP in brain tumors mainly focus on the predictive value of tumor volume. Furthermore, using biomarkers in the early setting will lead to a simplified and standardized way to estimate the poor outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ischemic stroke. Recently, observational studies revealed that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP, as a valuable potential diagnostic biomarker for neurosyphilis, had a sensitivity of 76.60% and specificity of 85.56%. The reason plasma GFAP could serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is that it effectively distinguished AD dementia from multiple neurodegenerative diseases and predicted the individual risk of AD progression. In addition, GFAP can be helpful in differentiating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) versus progressive MS (PMS).

Detection of Femtomolar Amyloid-β Peptides for Early-Stage Identification of Alzheimer's Amyloid-β Aggregation with Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles.,"Progressive amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrillar aggregates have long been considered as the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biocompatible and stable cysteine-Aβ peptide-conjugated gold nanoparticles (Cys-Aβ@AuNP) are demonstrated as suitable materials for detecting subfemtomolar Aβ peptides in human plasma. Incubation with Aβ peptides causes the Cys-Aβ@AuNP to aggregate and changes its absorption spectra. The spectral change is especially apparent and noticeable when detecting subfemtomolar Aβ peptides, and the aggregates contain only two or three AuNPs. Cys-Aβ@AuNP can also be used to identify early-stage Aβ oligomerization, which is not possible using the conventional method, in which the fluorescence of thioflavin-T is measured. The ability to detect Aβ oligomerization can facilitate therapeutics for AD. In addition, the binding of Aβ peptides by Cys-Aβ@AuNP in combination with centrifugation redirects the conventional Aβ aggregation pathway and can effectively inhibit the formation of toxic Aβ oligomers or fibrils. Therefore, the proposed Cys-Aβ@AuNP can also be used to develop effective therapeutic agents to inhibit Aβ aggregation. The results obtained in this study are expected to open revolutionary ways to both detect and inhibit Aβ aggregation at an early stage.",2024,aggregation; amyloid-β; biosensing; nanoparticle; surface plasmon,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Gold; Alzheimer Disease; Peptide Fragments; Metal Nanoparticles; Amyloid; Cysteine,"Chang, YJ; Chien, YH; Chang, CC; Wang, PN; Chen, YR; Chang, YC"

"Probable chronic pain, brain structure, and Alzheimer's plasma biomarkers in older men.","Chronic pain leads to tau accumulation and hippocampal atrophy in mice. In this study, we provide one of the first assessments in humans, examining the associations of probable chronic pain with hippocampal volume, integrity of the locus coeruleus (LC)-an upstream site of tau deposition-and Alzheimer's Disease-related plasma biomarkers. Participants were mostly cognitively unimpaired men. Probable chronic pain was defined as moderate-to-severe pain in 2+ study waves at average ages 56, 62, and 68. At age 68, 424 participants underwent structural magnestic resonance imaging (MRI) of hippocampal volume and LC-sensitive MRI providing an index of LC integrity (LC contrast-to-noise ratio). Analyses adjusted for confounders including major health conditions, depressive symptoms, and opioid use. Models showed that men with probable chronic pain had smaller hippocampal volume and lower rostral-middle-but not caudal-LC contrast-to-noise ratio compared to men without probable chronic pain. Men with probable chronic pain also had higher levels of plasma total tau, beta-amyloid-42, and beta-amyloid-40 compared to men without probable chronic pain. These findings suggest that probable chronic pain is associated with tau accumulation and reduced structural brain integrity in regions affected early in the development of Alzheimer's Disease.

Micromotor-based electrochemical immunoassays for reliable determination of amyloid-β (1-42) in Alzheimer's diagnosed clinical samples.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), in addition to being the most common cause of dementia, is very difficult to diagnose, with the 42-amino acid form of Aβ (Aβ-42) being one of the main biomarkers used for this purpose. Despite the enormous efforts made in recent years, the technologies available to determine Aβ-42 in human samples require sophisticated instrumentation, present high complexity, are sample and time-consuming, and are costly, highlighting the urgent need not only to develop new tools to overcome these limitations but to provide an early detection and treatment window for AD, which is a top-challenge. In recent years, micromotor (MM) technology has proven to add a new dimension to clinical biosensing, enabling ultrasensitive detections in short times and microscale environments. To this end, here an electrochemical immunoassay based on polypyrrole (PPy)/nickel (Ni)/platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) MM is proposed in a pioneering manner for the determination of Aβ-42 in left prefrontal cortex brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma samples from patients with AD. MM combines the high binding capacity of their immunorecognition external layer with self-propulsion through the catalytic generation of oxygen bubbles in the internal layer due to decomposition of hydrogen peroxide as fuel, allowing rapid bio-detection (15 min) of Aβ-42 with excellent selectivity and sensitivity (LOD = 0.06 ng/mL). The application of this disruptive technology to the analysis of just 25 μL of the three types of clinical samples provides values concordant with the clinical values reported, thus confirming the potential of the MM approach to assist in the reliable, simple, fast, and affordable diagnosis of AD by determining Aβ-42.",2024,Alzheimer biomarkers; Brain tissue; Cerebrospinal fluid; Dementia's disease; Plasma; Screen printed electrodes,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Polymers; Metal Nanoparticles; Biosensing Techniques; Platinum; Pyrroles; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Immunoassay; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Gordón Pidal, JM; Moreno-Guzmán, M; Montero-Calle, A; Valverde, A; Pingarrón, JM; Campuzano, S; Calero, M; Barderas, R; López, MÁ; Escarpa, A"
CSF 14-3-3 zeta(ζ) isoform is associated with tau pathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"14-3-3 is a family of conserved proteins that consist of seven isoforms which are highly expressed in the brain, and 14-3-3 zeta(ζ) is one of the isoforms encoded by the YWHAZ gene. Previous studies demonstrated that 14-3-3ζ is deposited in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and that 14-3-3ζ interacts with tau from the purified neurofibrillary tangles of AD brain extract. The present study examined the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3ζ levels of 719 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including cognitively normal (CN) participants, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and patients with AD dementia, and aimed to identify whether CSF 14-3-3ζ is associated with tau pathology. CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were increased in AD, and particularly elevated among tau pathology positive individuals. CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were associated with CSF phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau) (r = 0.741, P < 0.001) and plasma p-tau (r = 0.293, P < 0.001), which are fluid biomarkers of tau pathology, and could predict tau pathology positive status with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.891).

Silica Nanoparticle Exposure Implicates β-Amyloid (1-42) Inbound and the Accelerating Alzheimer's Disease Progression in Mice Overexpressing Mutated Forms of Human Amyloid Precursor Protein and Presenilin 1 Genes.,"The increasing nanoparticle (NP) applications in the biomedical field have become an emerging concern regarding human health. NP exposure may play a role in the accelerating Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression; however, the etiology of this disorder is complex and remains largely unclear. Here, we identified that intravenous injection of silica NPs (SiNPs) caused the blood-brain barrier breakdown via downregulating tight junction-related gene expressions. Meanwhile, SiNPs upregulate the transport receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) that govern the β-amyloid (Aβ) influx to the brain; however, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) that controls the efflux of Aβ from the brain was not affected. Consequently, an increase in Aβ burden in the brain of SiNP-challenged APP/PS1 mice was found. Intriguingly, plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorbed on the surface of SiNPs partially relieves this effect. Using ApoE knockout (ApoE",2024,,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Presenilin-1; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoproteins E; Nanoparticles; Silicon Dioxide; Mice, Transgenic; Disease Models, Animal; Peptide Fragments","Wei, W; Sun, H; Yang, B; Zhu, C; Song, E; Song, Y"
Sex-dependent effect of sublethal copper concentrations on de novo cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes and their possible links to variations in cholesterol and amyloid precursor protein levels in neuronal membranes.,"Cholesterol (Cho) is an essential lipophilic molecule in cells; however, both its decrease and its increase may favor the development of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although copper (Cu) is an essential trace metal for cells, the increased plasma concentration of its free form has been linked with AD development and severity. AD affects aged people, but its prevalence and severity are higher in women than in men. We have previously shown that Cu promotes Cho de novo synthesis in immature neurons as well as increased Cho in membrane rafts and Aβ levels in culture medium, but there are no results yet regarding sex differences in the effects of sublethal Cu exposure on Cho de novo synthesis.",2024,Astrocytes; Cholesterol; Copper; Neurons; Sexual differences,Female; Humans; Male; Aged; Copper; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Astrocytes; Reactive Oxygen Species; Alzheimer Disease; Cholesterol; Neurons,"Zubillaga, M; Tau, J; Rosa, D; Bellini, MJ; Arnal, N"
The plasma derived exosomal miRNA-483-5p/502-5p serve as potential MCI biomarkers in aging.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is rapidly becoming one of the most costly, fatal diseases, which is typically discovered in the late stage of molecular pathology, at which point medication intervention is irreversible. As a result, there is an urgent need for a low-cost, least-invasive way of screening cognitive impairment, with the goal of identifying persons at risk of AD. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been described as a transitional state between normal cognitive aging and AD. Early detection and timely tracking of MCI can to some extent prevent the progression towards AD. We found a population in Northwestern China has a comparatively high prevalence of MCI. Continued education, consistent exercise, and a secure financial situation can all help older people maintain cognitive function. Due to the critical role of circulating microRNAs in intercellular signaling and the perturbations thereof, their investigation has assumed paramount significance in elucidating various pathological conditions. Numerous investigations have substantiated the significance of circulating miRNAs specifically in MCI. Here, we evaluated miR-483-5p (Area Under the Curve (AUC) is 0.901, sensitivity 79.2 % and specificity 100 %) and miR-502-5p (AUC is 0.872, sensitivity 79.2 % and specificity 83.3 %), which were derived from plasma exosomes and maintained at high levels in elderly people with MCI, could be employed as promising noninvasive biomarkers.",2024,Aging; Early diagnosis; Exosome; MCI; miRNA,Humans; Aged; MicroRNAs; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Aging,"Liu, T; Li, N; Pu, J; Zhang, C; Xu, K; Wang, W; Liu, L; Gao, L; Xu, X; Tan, J"

Dilated PVSs are putative markers of impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid exchange, which plays an important role in removing cerebral waste. The aim of this cross-sectional, retrospective study was to define associations between biomarkers of inflammation and MRI-visible PVS (MV-PVS) burden in Veterans after blast-related mTBI (blast-mTBI) and controls.

Clinical evaluation of a novel plasma pTau217 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in Alzheimer's disease.,"A growing literature suggests that plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at amino acid 217 (pTau217) performs similarly to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and PET imaging to detect amyloid pathology and to provide diagnostic and prognostic information in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a significant limiting factor thus far has been a lack of widely available immunoassays. We evaluated a novel pTau217 S-PLEX® assay developed by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Rockville, MD) in plasma from 131 individuals with AD confirmed by CSF biomarkers and controls. Technical performance of the assay was excellent with an LLOQ of 1.84 pg/mL and intra/interplate CVs of 5.5% (0.3-15.0%) and 5.7% (range 0.3-13.4%), respectively. The pTau217 plasma assay differentiated AD and controls with an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.0) and pTau217 levels were 3.9-fold higher in individuals with AD. This performance was significantly better than what was observed for plasma pTau181, performed in parallel, and comparable to published data on existing pTau217 assays. While further clinical validation and head-to-head comparisons are needed to fully establish the role for the novel pTau217 S-PLEX assay, these data demonstrate the utility of the assay to detect AD pathology.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Immunologic Tests; Amino Acids; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Biomarkers,"Kivisäkk, P; Fatima, HA; Cahoon, DS; Otieno, B; Chacko, L; Minooei, F; Demos, C; Stengelin, M; Sigal, G; Wohlstadter, J; Arnold, SE"

Peripheral blood amyloid-β involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via impacting on peripheral innate immune cells.,"A key pathological factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of age-related dementia in the world, is excessive β-amyloid protein (Aβ) in extracellular aggregation in the brain. And in the peripheral blood, a large amount of Aβ is derived from platelets. So far, the causality between the levels of peripheral blood Aβ and its aggregation in the brain, particularly the role of the peripheral blood Aβ in the pathology of AD, is still unclear. And the relation between the peripheral blood Aβ and tau tangles of brain, another crucial pathologic factor contributing to the pathogenesis of AD, is also ambiguous. More recently, the anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies are approved for treatment of AD patients through declining the peripheral blood Aβ mechanism of action to enhance plasma and central nervous system (CNS) Aβ clearance, leading to a decrease Aβ burden in brain and improving cognitive function, which clearly indicates that the levels of the peripheral blood Aβ impacted on the Aβ burden in brain and involved in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, the role of peripheral innate immune cells in AD remains mostly unknown and the results obtained were controversial. In the present review, we summarize recent studies on the roles of peripheral blood Aβ and the peripheral innate immune cells in the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, based on the published data and our own work, we believe that peripheral blood Aβ plays an important role in the development and progression of AD by impacting on the peripheral innate immune cells.",2024,Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid-β; Inflammation; Peripheral immune cells,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Cognition; Immunity, Innate","Shi, M; Chu, F; Zhu, F; Zhu, J"

Longitudinal changes in the functional connectivity of individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"First-degree relatives of Alzheimer's disease patients constitute a key population in the search for early markers. Our group identified functional connectivity differences between cognitively unimpaired individuals with and without a family history. In this unprecedented follow-up study, we examine whether family history is associated with a longitudinal increase in the functional connectivity of those regions. Moreover, this is the first work to correlate electrophysiological measures with plasma p-tau231 levels, a known pathology marker, to interpret the nature of the change. We evaluated 69 cognitively unimpaired individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease and 28 without, at two different time points, approximately 3 years apart, including resting state magnetoencephalography recordings and plasma p-tau231 determinations. Functional connectivity changes in both precunei and left anterior cingulate cortex in the high-alpha band were studied using non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests. Connectivity values were correlated with p-tau231 levels. Three clusters emerged in individuals with family history, exhibiting a longitudinal increase of connectivity. Notably, the clusters for both precunei bore a striking resemblance to those found in previous cross-sectional studies. The connectivity values at follow-up and the change in connectivity in the left precuneus cluster showed significant positive correlations with p-tau231. This study consolidates the use of electrophysiology, in combination with plasma biomarkers, to monitor healthy individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease and emphasizes the value of combining noninvasive markers to understand the underlying mechanisms and track disease progression. This could facilitate the design of more effective intervention strategies and accurate progression assessment tools.",2024,"Alzheimer’s disease risk; Functional connectivity; Longitudinal; P-tau231, MEG",Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Follow-Up Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"García-Colomo, A; Nebreda, A; Carrasco-Gómez, M; de Frutos-Lucas, J; Ramirez-Toraño, F; Spuch, C; Comis-Tuche, M; Bruña, R; Alfonsín, S; Maestú, F"
[Development of early prediction and discriminating techniques for Lewy body diseases].,"The advent of a super-aged society poses urgent challenges in overcoming age-related neurological disorders and extending a healthy lifespan. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease are characterized by the accumulation of pathogenic proteins in the brain, leading to the formation of intracellular aggregates known as pathological hallmarks. In the early stages of protein accumulation, before the onset of clinical symptoms such as cognitive impairment or motor dysfunction, brain inflammation begins to occur. Subsequently, neuronal death progresses, and clinical symptoms manifest as dementia or Parkinson's disease. Therefore, there is a need for early prediction of neurodegeneration and the development of disease-modifying drugs for pre-symptomatic prevention.

Certain plasma p-tau217 assays recognize tau forms phosphorylated additionally at threonine-212, but the contribution of p-tau212 alone to AD is unknown. We developed a blood-based immunoassay that is specific to p-tau212 without cross-reactivity to p-tau217. Thereafter, we examined the diagnostic utility of plasma p-tau212. In five cohorts (n=388 participants), plasma p-tau212 showed high performances for AD diagnosis and for the detection of both amyloid and tau pathology, including at autopsy as well as in memory clinic populations. The diagnostic accuracy and fold changes of plasma p-tau212 were similar to those for p-tau217 but higher than p-tau181 and p-tau231. Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue slices showed prominent p-tau212 reactivity in neurofibrillary tangles that co-localized with p-tau217 and p-tau202/205.

Subject Harmonization of Digital Biomarkers: Improved Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the early stage of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a crucial stage for therapeutic interventions and treatment. Early detection of MCI offers opportunities for early intervention and significantly benefits cohort enrichment for clinical trials. Imaging and in vivo markers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have high detection performance, yet their prohibitive costs and intrusiveness demand more affordable and accessible alternatives. The recent advances in digital biomarkers, especially language markers, have shown great potential, where variables informative to MCI are derived from linguistic and/or speech and later used for predictive modeling. A major challenge in modeling language markers comes from the variability of how each person speaks. As the cohort size for language studies is usually small due to extensive data collection efforts, the variability among persons makes language markers hard to generalize to unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel subject harmonization tool to address the issue of distributional differences in language markers across subjects, thus enhancing the generalization performance of machine learning models.

Optimal blood tau species for the detection of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology: an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and autopsy study.,"Plasma-to-autopsy studies are essential for validation of blood biomarkers and understanding their relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Few such studies have been done on phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and those that exist have made limited or no comparison of the different p-tau variants. This study is the first to use immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to compare the accuracy of eight different plasma tau species in predicting autopsy-confirmed AD. The sample included 123 participants (AD = 69, non-AD = 54) from the Boston University Alzheimer's disease Research Center who had an available ante-mortem plasma sample and donated their brain. Plasma samples proximate to death were analyzed by targeted IP-MS for six different tryptic phosphorylated (p-tau-181, 199, 202, 205, 217, 231), and two non-phosphorylated tau (195-205, 212-221) peptides. NIA-Reagan Institute criteria were used for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Binary logistic regressions tested the association between each plasma peptide and autopsy-confirmed AD status. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) statistics were generated using predicted probabilities from the logistic regression models. Odds Ratio (OR) was used to study associations between the different plasma tau species and CERAD and Braak classifications. All tau species were increased in AD compared to non-AD, but p-tau217, p-tau205 and p-tau231 showed the highest fold-changes. Plasma p-tau217 (AUC = 89.8), p-tau231 (AUC = 83.4), and p-tau205 (AUC = 81.3) all had excellent accuracy in discriminating AD from non-AD brain donors, even among those with CDR < 1). Furthermore, p-tau217, p-tau205 and p-tau231 showed the highest ORs with both CERAD (OR",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Autopsy; Biomarkers; Blood; Mass spectrometry; Phosphorylated tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Autopsy; Biomarkers,"Montoliu-Gaya, L; Alosco, ML; Yhang, E; Tripodis, Y; Sconzo, D; Ally, M; Grötschel, L; Ashton, NJ; Lantero-Rodriguez, J; Sauer, M; Gomes, B; Nilsson, J; Brinkmalm, G; Sugarman, MA; Aparicio, HJ; Martin, B; Palmisano, JN; Steinberg, EG; Simkin, I; Turk, KW; Budson, AE; Au, R; Farrer, L; Jun, GR; Kowall, NW; Stern, RA; Goldstein, LE; Qiu, WQ; Mez, J; Huber, BR; Alvarez, VE; McKee, AC; Zetterberg, H; Gobom, J; Stein, TD; Blennow, K"
Voxel-based dysconnectomic brain morphometry with computed tomography in Down syndrome.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major health concern for aging adults with Down syndrome (DS), but conventional diagnostic techniques are less reliable in those with severe baseline disability. Likewise, acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate cerebral atrophy is not straightforward, as prolonged scanning times are less tolerated in this population. Computed tomography (CT) scans can be obtained faster, but poor contrast resolution limits its function for morphometric analysis. We implemented an automated analysis of CT scans to characterize differences across dementia stages in a cross-sectional study of an adult DS cohort.",2024,,Adult; Humans; Down Syndrome; Cross-Sectional Studies; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biomarkers,"Sánchez-Moreno, B; Zhang, L; Mateo, G; Moldenhauer, F; Brudfors, M; Ashburner, J; Nachev, P; de Asúa, DR; Strange, BA"
Impact of demographics and comorbid conditions on plasma biomarkers concentrations and their diagnostic accuracy in a memory clinic cohort.,"Plasma biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for identifying amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology. Before implementation in routine clinical practice, confounding factors modifying their concentration beyond neurodegenerative diseases should be identified. We studied the association of a comprehensive list of demographics, comorbidities, medication and laboratory parameters with plasma p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) on a prospective memory clinic cohort and studied their impact on diagnostic accuracy for discriminating CSF/amyloid PET-defined Aβ status. Three hundred sixty patients (mean age 66.5 years, 55% females, 53% Aβ positive) were included. Sex, age and Aβ status-adjusted models showed that only estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, standardized β -0.115 [-0.192 to -0.035], p = 0.005) was associated with p-tau181 levels, although with a much smaller effect than Aβ status (0.685 [0.607-0.763], p < 0.001). Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and eGFR significantly modified GFAP concentration. Age, blood volume (BV) and eGFR were associated with NfL levels. p-tau181 predicted Aβ status with 87% sensitivity and specificity with no relevant increase in diagnostic performance by adding any of the confounding factors. Using two cut-offs, plasma p-tau181 could have spared 62% of amyloid-PET/CSF testing. Excluding patients with chronic kidney disease did not change the proposed cut-offs nor the diagnostic performance. In conclusion, in a memory clinic cohort, age, sex, eGFR, BMI, BV and CCI slightly modified plasma p-tau181, GFAP and NfL concentrations but their impact on the diagnostic accuracy of plasma biomarkers for Aβ status discrimination was minimal.",2024,Blood biomarkers; Comorbidities; Dementia; Diagnostic performance; Neurodegenerative diseases,Female; Humans; Aged; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Biomarkers; Blood Volume; Demography; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins,"Sarto, J; Esteller-Gauxax, D; Tort-Merino, A; Guillén, N; Pérez-Millan, A; Falgàs, N; Borrego-Écija, S; Fernández-Villullas, G; Bosch, B; Juncà-Parella, J; Antonell, A; Naranjo, L; Ruiz-García, R; Augé, JM; Sánchez-Valle, R; Lladó, A; Balasa, M"

Signature of paraoxonases in the altered redox homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease.,"Paraoxonase (PON) enzymes (PON1, PON2 and PON3) exert antioxidant properties through arylesterase, lactonase and paraoxonase activities. Increasing findings suggested their potential involvement, particularly PON1 and PON2, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative pathology characterized by early oxidative stress. Specifically, decreased serum PON1-arylesterase and lactonase activities seem to be associated with an increased brain oxidative damage in early AD, leading to hypothesize that PON activity alterations might be an early event in AD. To address this hypothesis, the levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE; i.e. a marker of oxidative stress damage) along with the protein expression and enzymatic activity of PON1 and PON2 have been investigated in the brain and serum of young [Postnatal day (PD)8-10, 20-25 and 60-65] asymptomatic 3xTg-AD female mice, one of the most used transgenic models of AD. At PD 8-10, there were no differences in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) 4-HNE expression levels between 3xTg-AD mice compared to controls (Non-Tg mice). On the other hand, significant increased levels of 4-HNE were detected in PD 20-30 3xTg-AD mice hippocampus, while a significant reduction was observed in 3xTg-AD group at PD 60-65. In the PFC, 4-HNE levels were significantly reduced in 3xTg-AD mice brain at PD 20-30, while no differences in 4-HNE levels were detected at PD 60-65. No significant differences in arylesterase and lactonase activities were observed in the plasma of 3xTg-AD and Non-Tg mice at the different considered ages. Compared to Non-Tg mice, a reduction of brain arylesterase activity was found in 3xTg-AD female at PD 20-30 and PD 60-65, but it was significant only in the younger group. Finally, a similar trend was observed also for PON1 and PON2 protein levels, with both significantly, and solely, decreased in 3xTg-AD mice brain at PD 20-30. Overall, these findings suggest that the altered oxidative stress homeostasis in the 3xTg-AD female mice may be related to an early reduction in activity and expression of PONs enzymes most likely via a reduced brain arylesterases activity.",2024,4-Hydroxynonenal; Oxidative stress; Paraoxonase 1; Paraoxonase 2,"Female; Mice; Animals; Aryldialkylphosphatase; Alzheimer Disease; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Mice, Transgenic; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases","Beggiato, S; Ferrara, F; Romani, A; Cassano, T; Trentini, A; Valacchi, G; Cervellati, C; Ferraro, L"
Immunization Effects of a Novel α-Synuclein-Based Peptide Epitope Vaccine in Parkinson's Disease-Associated Pathology.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system, specifically the motor system. It is mainly caused by the loss of dopamine due to the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) protein in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Previous studies have reported that immunization may be a potential preventive strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the aim of the study was to design an α-syn specific epitope vaccine and investigate its effect in PD-related pathophysiology using an α-syn-induced mouse model. We used an in silico model to identify and design a non-toxic α-syn-based peptide epitope vaccine and, to overcome poor immunogenicity, the vaccine was coupled with immunogenic carrier proteins, i.e., ovalbumin (OVA) and keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Our results showed that vaccinated PD mouse models, especially with vaccines with carrier proteins, improved in motor functions compared with the non-vaccinated PD model. Additionally, the vaccinated groups showed increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the spleen and plasma as well as decreased interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the plasma. Furthermore, vaccinated groups, especially OVA and KLH groups, showed decrease in α-syn levels and increased dopamine-related markers, i.e., tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicle monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine transporter (DAT), and autophagy activities in the striatum and SNpc. Lastly, our data showed decreased neuroinflammation by reducing the activation of microglia and astrocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the immunized groups, especially with OVA and KLH carrier proteins. Overall, these results suggest that vaccination, especially with immunogenic carrier proteins, is effective in reducing the accumulation of α-syn aggregates in the brain and ameliorate PD-related pathophysiology. Hence, further development of this approach might have a potential role in preventing the development of PD.",2023,Parkinson’s disease (PD); epitope; immunization; neuroinflammation; α-synuclein,,"Park, JS; Ahmad, R; Choe, K; Kang, MH; Park, TJ; Kim, MO"
Blood Neurofilament Levels Predict Cognitive Decline across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum.,"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a potential diagnostic and prognostic plasma biomarker for numerous neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the relationship between baseline plasma concentration of Nfl and Mild Cognitive Impairment in participants who did and did not have a clinically determined diagnosis of dementia by the end of the three-year study. Additionally, we explored the connection between baseline plasma concentration of NfL and AD dementia patients, considering their demographics, clinical features, and cognitive profiles. A total of 350 participants from the Biomarker of AmyLoid pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk (BALTAZAR) multicenter prospective study were investigated: 161 AD dementia participants and 189 MCI participants (of which 141 had amnestic MCI and 48 non-amnestic MCI). Plasma biomarkers were measured at baseline and the progression of clinical and cognitive profiles was followed over the three years of follow-up. Baseline plasma NfL concentration increased across the Alzheimer's disease continuum with a mean NfL value of 17.1 ng/mL [SD = 6.1] in non-amnestic MCI, 20.7 ng/mL [SD = 12.0] in amnestic MCI, and 23.1 ng/mL [SD = 22.7] in AD dementia patients. Plasma NfL concentration correlated with age, body mass index (BMI), and global cognitive performance and decline, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MMSE scores decreased in parallel with increasing plasma NfL concentration, independently of age and BMI. However, NfL concentration did not predict MCI participants' conversion to dementia within three years. Discussion: Baseline plasma NfL concentration is associated with cognitive status along the AD continuum, suggesting its usefulness as a potential informative biomarker for cognitive decline follow-up in patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood; cognitive decline; neurofilament light chain,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Prospective Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Neurofilament Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Progression; tau Proteins,"Lehmann, S; Schraen-Maschke, S; Vidal, JS; Blanc, F; Paquet, C; Allinquant, B; Bombois, S; Gabelle, A; Delaby, C; Hanon, O"

Proteome Profiling of Brain Vessels in a Mouse Model of Cerebrovascular Pathology.,"Cerebrovascular pathology that involves altered protein levels (or signaling) of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) family has been associated with various forms of age-related dementias, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Transgenic mice overexpressing TGFβ1 in the brain (TGF mice) recapitulate VCID-associated cerebrovascular pathology and develop cognitive deficits in old age or when submitted to comorbid cardiovascular risk factors for dementia. We characterized the cerebrovascular proteome of TGF mice using mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics. Cerebral arteries were surgically removed from 6-month-old-TGF and wild-type mice, and proteins were extracted and analyzed by gel-free nanoLC-MS/MS.

Is blood pTau a reliable indicator of the CSF status?

Blood biomarkers are less invasive, easier to obtain and achievable by a cheaper means than those on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and significantly more economic than functional neuroimaging investigations; thus, a great interest is focused on blood isoforms of the phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau), indicators of ongoing tau pathology (i.e. neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs, an AD neuropathological hallmark) in the central nervous system (CNS). However, current data often highlight discordant results about the ability of blood pTau to predict CSF status.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Blood; CSF; Plasma; pTau,Humans; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Phosphorylation,"Antonioni, A; Raho, EM; Di Lorenzo, F"
Diffusion MRI tracks cortical microstructural changes during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.,"There is increased interest in developing markers reflecting microstructural changes that could serve as outcome measures in clinical trials. This is especially important after unexpected results in trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies targeting amyloid-β (Aβ), where morphological metrics from MRI showed increased volume loss despite promising clinical treatment effects. In this study, changes over time in cortical mean diffusivity, derived using diffusion tensor imaging, were investigated in a large cohort (n = 424) of non-demented participants from the Swedish BioFINDER study. Participants were stratified following the Aβ/tau (AT) framework. The results revealed a widespread increase in mean diffusivity over time, including both temporal and parietal cortical regions, in Aβ-positive but still tau-negative individuals. These increases were steeper in Aβ-positive and tau-positive individuals and robust to the inclusion of cortical thickness in the model. A steeper increase in mean diffusivity was also associated with both changes over time in fluid markers reflecting astrocytic activity (i.e. plasma level of glial fibrillary acidic protein and CSF levels of YKL-40) and worsening of cognitive performance (all P < 0.01). By tracking cortical microstructural changes over time and possibly reflecting variations related to the astrocytic response, cortical mean diffusivity emerges as a promising marker for tracking treatments-induced microstructural changes in clinical trials.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; astrocytes; clinical trials; cortical mean diffusivity,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Intermediate Filaments,"Spotorno, N; Strandberg, O; Stomrud, E; Janelidze, S; Blennow, K; Nilsson, M; van Westen, D; Hansson, O"
High-Performance Plasma Biomarker Panel for Alzheimer's Disease Screening Using a Femtomolar-Level Label-Free Biosensing System.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older people. However, diagnosing AD through noncognitive methods, such as invasive cerebrospinal fluid sampling or radioactive positron emission tomography, has limited applications. Herein, the femtomolar levels of AD biomarkers amyloid β 40 (Aβ40), amyloid β 42 (Aβ42), phosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau181), phosphorylated tau 217 (P-tau217), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were determined in human plasma in multicenter clinical cohorts using an ultrasensitive graphene field-effect transistor sensor. A machine-learning algorithm was also used to assemble these plasma biomarkers and optimize their performance in discriminating individual stages of Alzheimer's dementia progression. The ""composite-info"" biomarker panel, which combines these biomarkers and clinical information, considerably improved the staging performance in AD progression. It achieved an area under the curve of >0.94 in the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. In addition, the panel demonstrated an advantage in the individual-based stage assessment compared with that of the Mini-Mental State Examination/Montreal Cognitive Assessment and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

Implementation of an ultra-sensitive microwell-based electrochemical sensor for the detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in elderly people. It is diagnosed by detecting amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture or through expensive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Although blood-based diagnosis of AD offers a less invasive and cost-effective alternative, the quantification of Aβ is technically challenging due to its low abundance in peripheral blood. To address this, we developed a compact yet highly sensitive microwell-based electrochemical sensor with a densely packed microelectrode array (20 by 20) for enhancing sensitivity. Employing microwells on the working and counter electrodes minimized the leakage current from the metallic conductors into the assay medium, refining the signal fidelity. We achieved a detection limit <10 fg/mL for Aβ by elevating the signal-to-noise ratio, thus capable of AD biomarker quantification. Moreover, the microwell structure maintained the performance irrespective of variations in bead number, indicative of the sensor's robustness. The sensor's efficacy was validated through the analysis of Aβ concentrations in plasma samples from 96 subjects, revealing a significant distinction between AD patients and healthy controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85. Consequently, our novel microwell-based electrochemical biosensor represents a highly sensitive platform for detecting scant blood-based biomarkers, including Aβ, offering substantial potential for advancing AD diagnostics.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid Beta; Limits of Detection (LOD); Magnetic beads; Microwell-based electrochemical sensor; Patient plasma sample,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biosensing Techniques; Positron-Emission Tomography; Biomarkers; Microelectrodes; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,"Roy, S; Kang, S; Choi, KY; Lee, KH; Shin, KS; Kang, JY"
"A novel apoE-mimetic increases brain apoE levels, reduces Aβ pathology and improves memory when treated before onset of pathology in male mice that express APOE3.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive dysfunction and amyloid plaques composed of the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ). APOE is the greatest genetic risk for AD with APOE4 increasing risk up to ~ 15-fold compared to APOE3. Evidence suggests that levels and lipidation of the apoE protein could regulate AD progression. In glia, apoE is lipidated via cholesterol efflux from intracellular pools, primarily by the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Therefore, increasing ABCA1 activity is suggested to be a therapeutic approach for AD. CS-6253 (CS) is a novel apoE mimetic peptide that was developed to bind and stabilize ABCA1 and maintain its localization into the plasma membrane therefore promoting cholesterol efflux.

Online clinical tools to support the use of new plasma biomarker diagnostic technology in the assessment of Alzheimer's disease: a narrative review.,"Recent advances in new diagnostic technologies for Alzheimer's disease have improved the speed and precision of diagnosis. However, accessing the potential benefits of this technology poses challenges for clinicians, such as deciding whether it is clinically appropriate to order a diagnostic test, which specific test or tests to order and how to interpret test results and communicate these to the patient and their caregiver. Tools to support decision-making could provide additional structure and information to the clinical assessment process. These tools could be accessed online, and such 'e-tools' can provide an interactive interface to support patients and clinicians in the use of new diagnostic technologies for Alzheimer's disease. We performed a narrative review of the literature to synthesize information available on this research topic. Relevant studies that provide an understanding of how these online tools could be used to optimize the clinical utility of diagnostic technology were identified. Based on these, we discuss the ways in which e-tools have been used to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and propose recommendations for future research to aid further development.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; dementia; diagnosis; investigation,,"Hazan, J; Liu, KY; Fox, NC; Howard, R"

Correlation studies of Hippocampal Morphometry and Plasma NFL Levels in Cognitively Unimpaired Subjects.,"Alzheimer's disease(AD) is being the burden of society and family. Applying computing-aided strategies to reveal its pathology is one of the research highlights. Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) is an emerging noninvasive and economic biomarker for AD molecular pathology. It is valuable to reveal the correlations between the plasma NFL levels and neurodegeneration, especially hippcampal deformations at the preclinical stage. The negative correlation between plasma NFL levels and hippocampal volumes has been documented. However, the relationship between the plasma NFL levels and the hippocampal morphometry details at the preclinical stage is still elusive. This study seeks to demonstrate the capacity of our proposed surface-based hippocampal morphometry system to discern the plasma NFL positive (NFL+>41.9 pg/L) level and plasma NFL negative (NFL-<41.9pg/L) level and illustrate its superiority to the hippocampal volume measurement by drawing the cohort of 154 CU middle aged and elderly adults. We also apply this morphometry measure and a proposed sparse coding based classification algorithm to classify CU individuals with NFL+ and NFL- levels. Experimental results show that the proposed hippocampal morphometry system offers stronger statistical power to discriminate CU subjects with NFL+ and NFL- levels, comparing with the hippocampal volume measure. Furthermore, this system can discriminate plasma NFL levels in CU individuals (Accuracy=0.86). Both the group level and individual level analysis results indicate that the association between plasma NFL levels and the hippocampal shapes can be mapped at the preclinical stage.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Hippocampal morphometry; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Pattern analysis; Plasma NFL; Preclinical stage,,"Dong, Q; Li, Z; Liu, W; Chen, K; Su, Y; Wu, J; Caselli, RJ; Reiman, EM; Wang, Y; Shen, J"
Machine Learning models for detection and assessment of progression in Alzheimer's disease based on blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.,"Machine-learning techniques were applied to human blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data related to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients available via Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We observed the accuracy of AD diagnosis is greatest when protein biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid are combined with plasma proteins using Support Vector Machines (SVM); this is not improved by adding age and sex. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for our model of AD diagnosis based on a full (unbiased) set of plasma proteins was 0.94 in cross-validation and 0.82 on an external validation (test) set. Taking plasma in combination with CSF, the model reaches 0.98 area under the ROC curve on the test set. Accuracy of prediction of risk of mild cognitive impairment progressing to AD is the same for blood plasma biomarkers as for CSF and is not improved by combining them or adding age and sex as covariates.Clinical relevance- The identification of accurate and cost-effective biomarkers to screen for risk of developing AD and monitoring its progression is crucial for improved understanding of its causes and stratification of patients for treatments under development.

Extracellular vesicle proteome unveils cathepsin B connection to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane vesicles that are released extracellularly and considered to be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Here, CSF EVs of 16 ATN-classified cases were subjected to quantitative proteome analysis. In these CSF EVs, levels of 11 proteins were significantly altered during the ATN stage transitions (P < 0.05 and fold-change > 2.0). These proteins were thought to be associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and represent candidate biomarkers for pathogenic stage classification. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of CSF and plasma EVs revealed altered levels of cathepsin B (CatB) during the ATN transition (seven ATN groups in validation set, n = 136). The CSF and plasma EV CatB levels showed a negative correlation with CSF amyloid-β42 concentrations. This proteomic landscape of CSF EVs in ATN classifications can depict the molecular framework of Alzheimer's disease progression, and CatB may be considered a promising candidate biomarker and therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease amyloid pathology.",2024,ATN classification; Alzheimer’s disease; blood biomarker; cathepsin B; extracellular vesicle,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Proteome; Cathepsin B; Proteomics; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Yuyama, K; Sun, H; Fujii, R; Hemmi, I; Ueda, K; Igeta, Y"

Plasma Exchange Reduces Aβ Levels in Plasma and Decreases Amyloid Plaques in the Brain in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, characterized by the abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates in the brain, known as neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. It is believed that an imbalance between cerebral and peripheral pools of Aβ may play a relevant role in the deposition of Aβ aggregates. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of the removal of Aβ from blood plasma on the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. We performed monthly plasma exchange with a 5% mouse albumin solution in the APP/PS1 mouse model from 3 to 7 months old. At the endpoint, total Aβ levels were measured in the plasma, and soluble and insoluble brain fractions were analyzed using ELISA. Brains were also analyzed histologically for amyloid plaque burden, plaque size distributions, and gliosis. Our results showed a reduction in the levels of Aβ in the plasma and insoluble brain fractions. Interestingly, histological analysis showed a reduction in thioflavin-S (ThS) and amyloid immunoreactivity in the cortex and hippocampus, accompanied by a change in the size distribution of amyloid plaques, and a reduction in Iba1-positive cells. Our results provide preclinical evidence supporting the relevance of targeting Aβ in the periphery and reinforcing the potential use of plasma exchange as an alternative non-pharmacological strategy for slowing down AD pathogenesis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; albumin; amyloid plaque; amyloid-β; plasma exchange; plasmapheresis,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Plasma Exchange; Mice, Transgenic; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Plasma; Disease Models, Animal","Ramirez, S; Koerich, S; Astudillo, N; De Gregorio, N; Al-Lahham, R; Allison, T; Rocha, NP; Wang, F; Soto, C"
The Effect of Fat Intake with Increased Omega-6-to-Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Ratio in Animal Models of Early and Late Alzheimer's Disease-like Pathogenesis.,"This work aims to clarify the effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake on the adult brain affected by amyloid pathology. McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rat and 5xFAD Tg mouse models that represent earlier or later disease stages were employed. The animals were exposed to a control diet (CD) or an HFD based on corn oil, from young (rats) or adult (mice) ages for 24 or 10 weeks, respectively. In rats and mice, the HFD impaired reference memory in wild-type (WT) animals but did not worsen it in Tg, did not cause obesity, and did not increase triglycerides or glucose levels. Conversely, the HFD promoted stronger microglial activation in Tg vs. WT rats but had no effect on cerebral amyloid deposition. IFN-γ, IL-1β, and IL-6 plasma levels were increased in Tg rats, regardless of diet, while CXCL1 chemokine levels were increased in HFD-fed mice, regardless of genotype. Hippocampal 3-nitrotyrosine levels tended to increase in HFD-fed Tg rats but not in mice. Overall, an HFD with an elevated omega-6-to-omega-3 ratio as compared to the CD (25:1 vs. 8.4:1) did not aggravate the outcome of AD regardless of the stage of amyloid pathology, suggesting that many neurobiological processes relevant to AD are not directly dependent on PUFA intake.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; PUFA; high fat diet; inflammation; neuropathology; nutrition; omega-3/omega-6; oxidative stress; transgenic animals,"Mice; Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Brain; Mice, Transgenic; Amyloid; Disease Models, Animal; Rats, Transgenic; Diet, High-Fat","Galeano, P; de Ceglia, M; Mastrogiovanni, M; Campanelli, L; Medina-Vera, D; Campolo, N; Novack, GV; Rosell-Valle, C; Suárez, J; Aicardo, A; Campuzano, K; Castaño, EM; Do Carmo, S; Cuello, AC; Bartesaghi, S; Radi, R; Rodríguez de Fonseca, F; Morelli, L"
Cerebrospinal and Blood Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: Did Mild Cognitive Impairment Definition Affect Their Clinical Usefulness?,"Despite Alzheimer's Disease (AD) being known from the times of Alois Alzheimer, who lived more than one century ago, many aspects of the disease are still obscure, including the pathogenesis, the clinical spectrum definition, and the therapeutic approach. Well-established biomarkers for AD come from the histopathological hallmarks of the disease, which are Aβ and phosphorylated Tau protein aggregates. Consistently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Amyloid β (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau level measurements are currently used to detect AD presence. However, two central biases affect these biomarkers. Firstly, incomplete knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases legitimates the search for novel molecules that, reasonably, could be expressed by neurons and microglia and could be detected in blood simpler and earlier than the classical markers and in a higher amount. Further, studies have been performed to evaluate whether CSF biomarkers can predict AD onset in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. However, the MCI definition has changed over time. Hence, the studies on MCI patients seem to be biased at the beginning due to the imprecise enrollment and heterogeneous composition of the miscellaneous MCI subgroup. Plasma biomarkers and novel candidate molecules, such as microglia biomarkers, have been tentatively investigated and could represent valuable targets for diagnosing and monitoring AD. Also, novel AD markers are urgently needed to identify molecular targets for treatment strategies. This review article summarizes the main CSF and blood AD biomarkers, underpins their advantages and flaws, and mentions novel molecules that can be used as potential biomarkers for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; amyloid β; biomarkers; blood; flaws; phosphorylated tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Bivona, G; Iemmolo, M; Ghersi, G"
Plasma Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Risk for Incident Dementia in the UK Biobank Study: A Closer Look.,"Dietary omega-3 fatty acids are promising nutrients in dementia. Several prospective cohort studies have examined the relationships between circulating omega-3 (an objective biomarker of dietary intake) and incident dementia, the largest to date being a report from the UK Biobank (n = 102,722). Given the recent release of new metabolomics data from baseline samples from the UK Biobank, we re-examined the association in a much larger sample (n = 267,312) and also focused on associations with total omega-3, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and non-DHA omega-3. Using Cox regression models, we observed that the total omega-3 status was inversely related to the risk of Alzheimer's (Q5 vs. Q1, hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.87 [0.76; 1.00]) and all-cause dementia (Q5 vs. Q1, 0.79 [0.72; 0.87]). The strongest associations were observed for total omega-3 (and non-DHA omega-3) and all-cause dementia. In prespecified strata, we found stronger associations in men, and in those aged ≥60 years at baseline (vs. those aged 50-59). Thus, in the largest study to date on this topic, we confirmed the favorable relationships between DHA and risk for dementia, and we also found evidence that non-DHA omega-3 may be beneficial. Finally, we have better defined the populations most likely to benefit from omega-3-based interventions.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; DHA; biomarkers; dementia; diet; docosahexaenoic acid; fatty acids; lipidomics,"Male; Humans; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Prospective Studies; Biological Specimen Banks; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Dementia; Eicosapentaenoic Acid; Fatty Acids","Sala-Vila, A; Tintle, N; Westra, J; Harris, WS"

Detection of APP gene recombinant in human blood plasma.,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to involve the accumulation of amyloid-β in the brain, which is produced by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Recently, analysis of genomic DNA and mRNA from postmortem brain neurons has revealed intra-exonic recombinants of APP (gencDNA), which have been implicated in the accumulation of amyloid-β. In this study, we computationally analyzed publicly available sequence data (SRA) using probe sequences we constructed to screen APP gencDNAs. APP gencDNAs were detected in SRAs constructed from both genomic DNA and RNA obtained from the postmortem brain and in the SRA constructed from plasma cell-free mRNA (cf-mRNA). The SRA constructed from plasma cf-mRNA showed a significant difference in the number of APP gencDNA reads between SAD and NCI: the p-value from the Mann-Whitney U test was 5.14 × 10",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Plasma; RNA, Messenger; DNA","Mitsunaga, S; Fujito, N; Nakaoka, H; Imazeki, R; Nagata, E; Inoue, I"

Integrated omics analysis of coronary artery calcifications and myocardial infarction: the Framingham Heart Study.,"Gene function can be described using various measures. We integrated association studies of three types of omics data to provide insights into the pathophysiology of subclinical coronary disease and myocardial infarction (MI). Using multivariable regression models, we associated: (1) single nucleotide polymorphism, (2) DNA methylation, and (3) gene expression with coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores and MI. Among 3106 participants of the Framingham Heart Study, 65 (2.1%) had prevalent MI and 60 (1.9%) had incident MI, median CAC value was 67.8 [IQR 10.8, 274.9], and 1403 (45.2%) had CAC scores > 0 (prevalent CAC). Prevalent CAC was associated with AHRR (linked to smoking) and EXOC3 (affecting platelet function and promoting hemostasis). CAC score was associated with VWA1 (extracellular matrix protein associated with cartilage structure in endomysium). For prevalent MI we identified FYTTD1 (down-regulated in familial hypercholesterolemia) and PINK1 (linked to cardiac tissue homeostasis and ischemia-reperfusion injury). Incident MI was associated with IRX3 (enhancing browning of white adipose tissue) and STXBP3 (controlling trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 to plasma). Using an integrative trans-omics approach, we identified both putatively novel and known candidate genes associated with CAC and MI.

Brain apolipoprotein E levels in mice challenged by a Western diet increase in an allele-dependent manner.,"Human apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the greatest determinant of genetic risk for memory deficits and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While APOE4 drives memory loss and high AD risk, APOE2 leads to healthy brain aging and reduced AD risk compared to the common APOE3 variant. We examined brain APOE protein levels in humanized mice homozygous for these alleles and found baseline levels to be age- and isoform-dependent: APOE2 levels were greater than APOE3, which were greater than APOE4. Despite the understanding that APOE lipoparticles do not traverse the blood-brain barrier, we show that brain APOE levels are responsive to dietary fat intake. Challenging mice for 6 months on a Western diet high in fat and cholesterol increased APOE protein levels in an allele-dependent fashion with a much greater increase within blood plasma than within the brain. In the brain, APOE2 levels responded most to the Western diet challenge, increasing by 20 % to 30 %. While increased lipoparticles are generally deleterious in the periphery, we propose that higher brain APOE2 levels may represent a readily available pool of beneficial lipid particles for neurons.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Apolipoprotein E; Regular diet; Western diet,,"Liemisa, B; Newbury, SF; Novy, MJ; Pasato, JA; Morales-Corraliza, J; Peng, KY; Mathews, PM"

Interfacial Electromigration for Analysis of Biofluid Lipids in Small Volumes.,"Lipids are important biomarkers within the field of disease diagnostics and can serve as indicators of disease progression and predictors of treatment effectiveness. Although lipids can provide important insight into how diseases initiate and progress, mass spectrometric methods for lipid characterization and profiling are limited due to lipid structural diversity, particularly the presence of various lipid isomers. Moreover, the difficulty of handling small-volume samples exacerbates the intricacies of biological analyses. In this work, we have developed a strategy that electromigrates a thin film of a small-volume biological sample directly to the air-liquid interface formed at the tip of a theta capillary. Importantly, we seamlessly integrated in situ biological lipid extraction with accelerated chemical derivatization, enabled by the air-liquid interface, and conducted isomeric structural characterization within a unified platform utilizing theta capillary nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry, all tailored for small-volume sample analysis. We applied this unified platform to the analysis of lipids from small-volume human plasma and Alzheimer's disease mouse serum samples. Accelerated electro-epoxidation of unsaturated lipids at the interface allowed us to characterize lipid double-bond positional isomers. The unique application of electromigration of a thin film to the air-liquid interface in combination with accelerated interfacial reactions holds great potential in small-volume sample analysis for disease diagnosis and prevention.",2023,,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Mass Spectrometry; Isomerism; Lipids; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization","Edwards, ME; Freitas, DP; Hirtzel, EA; White, N; Wang, H; Davidson, LA; Chapkin, RS; Sun, Y; Yan, X"

The Diagnostic Use of the Plasma Quantification of 24S-Hydroxycholesterol and Other Oxysterols in Neurodegenerative Disease.,"Cholesterol regulates fluidity and structure of cellular membranes. The brain is involved in signal transduction, synaptogenesis, and membrane trafficking. An impairment of its metabolism was observed in different neurodegenerative diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer, and Huntington diseases. Because of the blood-brain barrier, cholesterol cannot be uptaken from the circulation and all the cholesterol is locally synthetized. The excess cholesterol in neurons is converted into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) by the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1). The plasmatic concentration of 24OHC results in the balance between cerebral production and liver elimination. It is related to the number of metabolically active neurons in the brain. Several factors that affect the brain cholesterol turnover and the liver elimination of oxysterols, the genetic background, nutrition, and lifestyle habits were found to significantly affect plasma levels of 24OHC. Reduced levels of 24OHC were found related to the loss of metabolically active cells and the degree of brain atrophy. The dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, inflammation, and increased cholesterol turnover might overlap with this progressive reduction giving temporary increased levels of 24OHC.The study of plasma 24OHC is likely to offer an insight into brain cholesterol turnover with a limited diagnostic power.",2024,24S-Hydroxycholesterols; Alzheimer disease; Biomarkers; Cholesterol; Huntington disease; Lipidomic; Mass spectrometry; Multiple sclerosis; Neurodegenerative diseases; Oxysterols; Parkinson disease,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Oxysterols; Hydroxycholesterols; Cholesterol; Brain,"Tripodi, D; Vitarelli, F; Spiti, S; Leoni, V"

Detection of neuron-derived cfDNA in blood plasma: a new diagnostic approach for neurodegenerative conditions.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose significant challenges in early diagnosis, leading to irreversible brain damage and cognitive decline. In this study, we present a novel diagnostic approach that utilizes whole molecule analysis of neuron-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing Differential Methylation Regions (DMRs) between purified cortical neurons and blood plasma samples, we identified robust biomarkers that accurately distinguish between neuronal and non-neuronal cfDNA. The use of cfDNA offers the advantage of convenient and minimally invasive sample collection compared to traditional cerebrospinal fluid or tissue biopsies, making this approach more accessible and patient friendly. Targeted sequencing at the identified DMR locus demonstrated that a conservative cutoff of 5% of neuron-derived cfDNA in blood plasma accurately identifies 100% of patients diagnosed with AD, showing promising potential for early disease detection. Additionally, this method effectively differentiated between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who later progressed to AD and those who did not, highlighting its prognostic capabilities. Importantly, the differentiation between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls demonstrated the specificity of our approach. Furthermore, this cfDNA-based diagnostic strategy outperforms recently developed protein-based assays, which often lack accuracy and convenience. While our current approach focused on a limited set of loci, future research should explore the development of a more comprehensive model incorporating multiple loci to increase diagnostic accuracy further. Although certain limitations, such as technical variance associated with PCR amplification and bisulfite conversion, need to be addressed, this study emphasizes the potential of cfDNA analysis as a valuable tool for pre-symptomatic detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. With further development and validation, this innovative diagnostic strategy has the potential to significantly impact the field of neurodegenerative disease research and patient care, offering a promising avenue for early intervention and personalized therapeutic approaches.",2023,Alzheimer’s; DNA methylation; cfDNA; disease monitoring; neurodegenerative diseases; pre-symptomatic diagnostic,,"Pollard, C; Aston, K; Emery, BR; Hill, J; Jenkins, T"

"Potential Implications of miRNAs in the Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Therapeutics of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial disorder that poses a substantial burden on patients, caregivers, and society. Considering the increased aging population and life expectancy, the incidence of AD will continue to rise in the following decades. However, the molecular pathogenesis of AD remains controversial, superior blood-based biomarker candidates for early diagnosis are still lacking, and effective therapeutics to halt or slow disease progression are urgently needed. As powerful genetic regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) are receiving increasing attention due to their implications in the initiation, development, and theranostics of various diseases, including AD. In this review, we summarize miRNAs that directly target microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) transcripts and regulate the alternative splicing of tau and APP. We also discuss related kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), as well as apolipoprotein E, that are directly targeted by miRNAs to control tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenic APP processing leading to Aβ pathologies. Moreover, there is evidence of miRNA-mediated modulation of inflammation. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs in the serum or plasma of AD patients as noninvasive biomarkers with diagnostic potential are reviewed.

Assessing the Biological Mechanisms Linking Smoking Behavior and Cognitive Function: A Mediation Analysis of Untargeted Metabolomics.,"(1) Smoking is the most significant preventable health hazard in the modern world. It increases the risk of vascular problems, which are also risk factors for dementia. In addition, toxins in cigarettes increase oxidative stress and inflammation, which have both been linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). This study identified potential mechanisms of the smoking-cognitive function relationship using metabolomics data from the longitudinal Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). (2) 1266 WRAP participants were included to assess the association between smoking status and four cognitive composite scores. Next, untargeted metabolomic data were used to assess the relationships between smoking and metabolites. Metabolites significantly associated with smoking were then tested for association with cognitive composite scores. Total effect models and mediation models were used to explore the role of metabolites in smoking-cognitive function pathways. (3) Plasma N-acetylneuraminate was associated with smoking status Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 3 (PACC3) and Immediate Learning (IMM). N-acetylneuraminate mediated 12% of the smoking-PACC3 relationship and 13% of the smoking-IMM relationship.

Nano-Brush Structure for Rapid Label-Free Differentiation of Alzheimer's Disease Stages and Direct Capture of Neuron-Derived Exosomes from Human Blood Plasma.,"The measurement of the neurofilament light chain (NFL) in human blood plasma/serum is a promising liquid biopsy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, offering advantages over conventional neuroimaging techniques recommended in clinical guidelines. Here, a controllable nano-brush structure comprising upstanding silicon nanowires coated with indium tin oxide was employed as the sensing substrate. This nano-brush structure was modified with an NFL antibody (NFLAb) via silane coupling and then further connected as the extended gate in a field-effect transistor (EGFET). Notable signal differences emerged within a 2 min timeframe, enabling the label-free differentiation in human blood plasmas among four distinct cohorts: healthy controls, subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia due to AD. Our study indicates that achieving a surface roughness exceeding 400 nm on the modified nano-brush structure enables the effective electrical sensing in our EGFETs. These distinct electrical responses measured via the NFLAb-modified nano-brush EGFETs can be attributed to the combined effects of the captured NFLs and NFL-specific neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) found in dementia patients, as confirmed by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Finally, the potential of quantitatively detecting NDEs on the NFLAb-modified nano-brush structure was demonstrated using spiked solutions containing NFL-specific NDEs from IMR-32 neuroblast cells, wherein concentration-dependent changes were observed in the EGFETs output signal. Our findings show that the NFLAb-modified nano-brush EGFET enables rapid, label-free differentiation between healthy individuals and patients at varying stages of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease stage; nano-brush structure; neurofilament light chain; neuron-derived exosome; sensing substrate; upstanding nanowires,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Exosomes; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neurons; Plasma; Biomarkers,"Lin, SP; Lee, WJ; Sun, MC; Yang, YH; Vinzons, LU; Lin, YM; Wei, YT"

Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 in at-risk adults and autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer brains.,"Insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and their receptors are highly expressed in the adult hippocampus. Thus, disturbances in the insulin-IGF signalling pathway may account for the selective vulnerability of the hippocampus to nascent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In the present study, we examined the predominant IGF-binding protein in the CSF, IGFBP2. CSF was collected from 109 asymptomatic members of the parental history-positive PREVENT-AD cohort. CSF levels of IGFBP2, core AD and synaptic biomarkers were measured using proximity extension assay, ELISA and mass spectrometry. Cortical amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposition were examined using 18F-NAV4694 and flortaucipir. Cognitive assessments were performed during up to 8 years of follow-up, using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. T1-weighted structural MRI scans were acquired, and neuroimaging analyses were performed on pre-specified temporal and parietal brain regions. Next, in an independent cohort, we allocated 241 dementia-free ADNI-1 participants into four stages of AD progression based on the biomarkers CSF Aβ42 and total-tau (t-tau). In this analysis, differences in CSF and plasma IGFBP2 levels were examined across the pathological stages. Finally, IGFBP2 mRNA and protein levels were examined in the frontal cortex of 55 autopsy-confirmed AD and 31 control brains from the Quebec Founder Population (QFP) cohort, a unique population isolated from Eastern Canada. CSF IGFBP2 progressively increased over 5 years in asymptomatic PREVENT-AD participants. Baseline CSF IGFBP2 was positively correlated with CSF AD biomarkers and synaptic biomarkers, and negatively correlated with longitudinal changes in delayed memory (P = 0.024) and visuospatial abilities (P = 0.019). CSF IGFBP2 was negatively correlated at a trend-level with entorhinal cortex volume (P = 0.082) and cortical thickness in the piriform (P = 0.039), inferior temporal (P = 0.008), middle temporal (P = 0.014) and precuneus (P = 0.033) regions. In ADNI-1, CSF (P = 0.009) and plasma (P = 0.001) IGFBP2 were significantly elevated in Stage 2 [CSF Aβ(+)/t-tau(+)]. In survival analyses in ADNI-1, elevated plasma IGFBP2 was associated with a greater rate of AD conversion (hazard ratio = 1.62, P = 0.021). In the QFP cohort, IGFBP2 mRNA was reduced (P = 0.049); however, IGFBP2 protein levels did not differ in the frontal cortex of autopsy-confirmed AD brains (P = 0.462). Nascent AD pathology may induce an upregulation in IGFBP2 in asymptomatic individuals.

Oxylipin transport by lipoprotein particles and its functional implications for cardiometabolic and neurological disorders.,"Lipoprotein metabolism is critical to inflammation. While the periphery and central nervous system (CNS) have separate yet connected lipoprotein systems, impaired lipoprotein metabolism is implicated in both cardiometabolic and neurological disorders. Despite the substantial investigation into the composition, structure and function of lipoproteins, the lipoprotein oxylipin profiles, their influence on lipoprotein functions, and their potential biological implications are unclear. Lipoproteins carry most of the circulating oxylipins. Importantly, lipoprotein-mediated oxylipin transport allows for endocrine signaling by these lipid mediators, long considered to have only autocrine and paracrine functions. Alterations in plasma lipoprotein oxylipin composition can directly impact inflammatory responses of lipoprotein metabolizing cells. Similar investigations of CNS lipoprotein oxylipins are non-existent to date. However, as APOE4 is associated with Alzheimer's disease-related microglia dysfunction and oxylipin dysregulation, ApoE4-dependent lipoprotein oxylipin modulation in neurological pathologies is suggested. Such investigations are crucial to bridge knowledge gaps linking oxylipin- and lipoprotein-related disorders in both periphery and CNS. Here, after providing a summary of existent literatures on lipoprotein oxylipin analysis methods, we emphasize the importance of lipoproteins in oxylipin transport and argue that understanding the compartmentalization and distribution of lipoprotein oxylipins may fundamentally alter our consideration of the roles of lipoprotein in cardiometabolic and neurological disorders.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4); COVID-19; Cardiometabolic disorders; Immune memory; Inflammation; Lipoproteins; Neurodegenerative disorders; Neurological disorders; Oxylipins; Trained immunity,Humans; Oxylipins; Apolipoprotein E4; Lipoproteins; Nervous System Diseases; Cardiovascular Diseases,"Liang, N; Harsch, BA; Zhou, S; Borkowska, A; Shearer, GC; Kaddurah-Daouk, R; Newman, JW; Borkowski, K"

"Trajectories of CSF and plasma biomarkers across Alzheimer's disease continuum: disease staging by NF-L, p-tau181, and GFAP.","CSF-to-plasma transition will open new avenues for molecular phenotyping of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we evaluated a panel of AD biomarkers in matched CSF and plasma samples across the AD continuum, from preclinical AD to dementia. The aims were to: 1) compare diagnostic performance of the two biofluids, 2) evaluate trajectories of the biomarkers along AD progression. We analyzed CSF and plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau231, t-tau, NF-L, GFAP, UCHL-1 and CSF SNAP-25 in a cohort (n = 173) of preclinical AD, MCI-AD, AD dementia, frontotemporal dementia patients, and controls. We found a significant correlation between CSF and plasma levels of Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau231, NF-L, and GFAP, while no CSF-plasma correlation was observed for t-tau and UCHL-1. Next to the core CSF biomarkers (Aβ42/40, p-tau181, t-tau), those providing the best discrimination between controls and preclinical AD were CSF p-tau231 and SNAP-25 and plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau231, and GFAP. Among plasma biomarkers, we found Aβ42/Aβ40, GFAP, and p-tau231 to show the largest rate of change at the CSF biomarker-defined cut-offs for amyloidosis and tauopathy. Finally, we identified GFAP, NF-L, and p-tau181 as the biomarkers most significantly associated with disease progression in both CSF and plasma. We suggest that a well-standardized and validated panel of selected plasma markers can facilitate early AD diagnosis, even at the asymptomatic disease stage. We propose that both CSF and plasma measurement of NF-L, p-tau181, and GFAP may play a significant role in disease staging and monitoring.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Biomarkers; Blood; Cerebrospinal fluid; Frontotemporal dementia; Simoa; preclinical Alzheimer's disease,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloidosis; Biomarkers; tau Proteins,"Wojdała, AL; Bellomo, G; Gaetani, L; Toja, A; Chipi, E; Shan, D; Chiasserini, D; Parnetti, L"
Leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibition improves age-related cognitive decline via modulation of synaptic function.,"Leukotrienes, a class of inflammatory bioactive lipids, are well studied in the periphery, but less is known of their importance in the brain. We identified that the enzyme leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) is expressed in healthy mouse neurons, and inhibition of LTA4H in aged mice improves hippocampal dependent memory. Single-cell nuclear RNA sequencing of hippocampal neurons after inhibition reveals major changes to genes important for synaptic organization, structure, and activity. We propose that LTA4H inhibition may act to improve cognition by directly inhibiting the enzymatic activity in neurons, leading to improved synaptic function. In addition, LTA4H plasma levels are increased in both aging and Alzheimer's disease and correlated with cognitive impairment. These results identify a role for LTA4H in the brain, and we propose that LTA4H inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy to treat cognitive decline in aging related diseases.",2023,,Mice; Animals; Epoxide Hydrolases; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Adams, JM; Rege, SV; Liu, AT; Vu, NV; Raina, S; Kirsher, DY; Nguyen, AL; Harish, R; Szoke, B; Leone, DP; Czirr, E; Braithwaite, S; Kerrisk Campbell, M"

Roles of peripheral lipoproteins and cholesteryl ester transfer protein in the vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia.,"This narrative review focuses on the role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and peripheral lipoproteins in the vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Humans have a peripheral lipoprotein profile where low-density lipoproteins (LDL) represent the dominant lipoprotein fraction and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) represent a minor lipoprotein fraction. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are well-established to cause cardiovascular disease and several LDL-C-lowering therapies are clinically available to manage this vascular risk factor. The efficacy of LDL-C-lowering therapies to reduce risk of all-cause dementia and AD is now important to address as recent studies demonstrate a role for LDL in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as well as in all-cause dementia. The LDL:HDL ratio in humans is set mainly by CETP activity, which exchanges cholesteryl esters for triglycerides across lipoprotein fractions to raise LDL and lower HDL as CETP activity increases. Genetic and pharmacological studies support the hypothesis that CETP inhibition reduces cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL, which, by extension, may also lower VCID. Unlike humans, wild-type mice do not express catalytically active CETP and have HDL as their major lipoprotein fraction. As HDL has potent beneficial effects on endothelial cells, the naturally high HDL levels in mice protect them from vascular disorders, likely including VCID. Genetic restoration of CETP expression in mice to generate a more human-like lipid profile may increase the relevance of murine models for VCID studies. The therapeutic potential of existing and emerging LDL-lowering therapies for VCID will be discussed. Figure Legend. Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein in Alzheimer's Disease. CETP is mainly produced by the liver, and exchanges cholesteryl esters for triglycerides across lipoprotein fractions to raise circulating LDL and lower HDL as CETP activity increases. Low CETP activity is associated with better cardiovascular health, due to decreased LDL and increased HDL, which may also improve brain health. Although most peripheral lipoproteins cannot enter the brain parenchyma due to the BBB, it is increasingly appreciated that direct access to the vascular endothelium may enable peripheral lipoproteins to have indirect effects on brain health. Thus, lipoproteins may affect the cerebrovasculature from both sides of the BBB. Recent studies show an association between elevated plasma LDL, a well-known cardiovascular risk factor, and a higher risk of AD, and considerable evidence suggests that high HDL levels are associated with reduced CAA and lower neuroinflammation. Considering the potential detrimental role of LDL in AD and the importance of HDL's beneficial effects on endothelial cells, high CETP activity may lead to compromised BBB integrity, increased CAA deposits and greater neuroinflammation.

Multi-Omics Data Integration Reveals Sex-Dependent Hippocampal Programming by Maternal High-Fat Diet during Lactation in Adult Mouse Offspring.,"Early-life exposure to high-fat diets (HF) can program metabolic and cognitive alterations in adult offspring. Although the hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory and metabolic homeostasis, few studies have reported the impact of maternal HF on this structure. We assessed the effects of maternal HF during lactation on physiological, metabolic, and cognitive parameters in young adult offspring mice. To identify early-programming mechanisms in the hippocampus, we developed a multi-omics strategy in male and female offspring. Maternal HF induced a transient increased body weight at weaning, and a mild glucose intolerance only in 3-month-old male mice with no change in plasma metabolic parameters in adult male and female offspring. Behavioral alterations revealed by a Barnes maze test were observed both in 6-month-old male and female mice. The multi-omics strategy unveiled sex-specific transcriptomic and proteomic modifications in the hippocampus of adult offspring. These studies that were confirmed by regulon analysis show that, although genes whose expression was modified by maternal HF were different between sexes, the main pathways affected were similar with mitochondria and synapses as main hippocampal targets of maternal HF. The effects of maternal HF reported here may help to better characterize sex-dependent molecular pathways involved in cognitive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.",2023,hippocampus; maternal high-fat diet; multi-omics; sexual dimorphism,"Animals; Mice; Female; Male; Humans; Diet, High-Fat; Obesity; Multiomics; Proteomics; Lactation; Hippocampus; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects","Gauvrit, T; Benderradji, H; Pelletier, A; Aboulouard, S; Faivre, E; Carvalho, K; Deleau, A; Vallez, E; Launay, A; Bogdanova, A; Besegher, M; Le Gras, S; Tailleux, A; Salzet, M; Buée, L; Delahaye, F; Blum, D; Vieau, D"
"Anti-Amyloid Therapy, AD, and ARIA: Untangling the Role of CAA.","Anti-amyloid therapies (AATs), such as anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, are emerging treatments for people with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). AATs target amyloid β plaques in the brain. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), abnormal signals seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in patients with AD, may occur spontaneously but occur more frequently as side effects of AATs. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a major risk factor for ARIA. Amyloid β plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD and of CAA. Amyloid β accumulation in the brain parenchyma as plaques is a pathological hallmark of AD, whereas amyloid β accumulation in cerebral vessels leads to CAA. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of ARIA is necessary for early detection of those at highest risk. This could lead to improved risk stratification and the ultimate reduction of symptomatic ARIA. Histopathological confirmation of CAA by brain biopsy or autopsy is the gold standard but is not clinically feasible. MRI is an available in vivo tool for detecting CAA. Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid β level testing and amyloid PET imaging are available but do not offer specificity for CAA vs amyloid plaques in AD. Thus, developing and testing biomarkers as reliable and sensitive screening tools for the presence and severity of CAA is a priority to minimize ARIA complications.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; amyloid β; anti-amyloid therapy; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; plasma,,"Sin, MK; Zamrini, E; Ahmed, A; Nho, K; Hajjar, I"
Multifunctional agents against Alzheimer's disease based on oxidative stress: Polysubstituted pyrazine derivatives synthesized by multicomponent reactions.,"As Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex pathogenesis, the exploration of multi-target drugs may be an effective strategy for AD treatment. Multifunctional small molecular agents can be obtained by connecting two or more active drugs or privileged pharmacophores by multicomponent reactions (MCRs). In this paper, two series of polysubstituted pyrazine derivatives with multifunctional moieties were designed as anti-AD agents and synthesized by Passerini-3CR and Ugi-4CR. Since the oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathological process of AD, the antioxidant activities of the newly synthesized compounds were first evaluated.

Comparison of CSF and plasma NfL and pNfH for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: a memory clinic study.,"Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising biomarker of axonal damage for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) has demonstrated its value in motor neuron diseases diagnosis, but has less been explored for dementia diagnosis. In a cross-sectional study, we compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma NfL and pNfH levels in n = 188 patients from Lariboisière Hospital, Paris, France, including AD patients at mild cognitive impairment stage (AD-MCI, n = 36) and dementia stage (n = 64), non-AD MCI (n = 38), non-AD dementia (n = 28) patients and control subjects (n = 22). Plasma NfL, plasma and CSF pNfH levels were measured using Simoa and CSF NfL using ELISA. The correlation between CSF and plasma levels was stronger for NfL than pNfH (rho = 0.77 and rho = 0.52, respectively). All neurofilament markers were increased in AD-MCI, AD dementia and non-AD dementia groups compared with controls. CSF NfL, CSF pNfH and plasma NfL showed high performance to discriminate AD at both MCI and dementia stages from control subjects [AUC (area under the curve) = 0.82-0.91]. Plasma pNfH displayed overall lower AUCs for discrimination between groups compared with CSF pNfH. Neurofilament markers showed similar moderate association with cognition. NfL levels displayed significant association with mediotemporal lobe atrophy and white matter lesions in the AD group. Our results suggest that CSF NfL and pNfH as well as plasma NfL levels display equivalent performance in both positive and differential AD diagnosis in memory clinic settings. In contrast to motoneuron disorders, plasma pNfH did not demonstrate added value as compared with plasma NfL.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Fluid biomarkers; Neurofilament; Neurofilament light; Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy; Plasma biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Motor Neuron Disease; Nervous System Diseases; Neurofilament Proteins; tau Proteins,"Vrillon, A; Ashton, NJ; Karikari, TK; Götze, K; Cognat, E; Dumurgier, J; Lilamand, M; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Paquet, C"
Travels with tau prions.,"Tau was originally identified as a microtubule associated protein, and subsequently recognized to constitute the fibrillar assemblies found in Alzheimer disease and related neurodegenerative tauopathies. Point mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene cause dominantly inherited tauopathies, and most predispose it to aggregate. This indicates tau aggregation underlies pathogenesis of tauopathies. Our work has suggested that tau functions as a prion, forming unique intracellular pathological assemblies that subsequently move to other cells, inducing further aggregation that underlies disease progression. Remarkably, in simple cells tau forms stably propagating aggregates of distinct conformation, termed strains. Each strain induces a unique and, in some cases, transmissible, neuropathological phenotype upon inoculation into a mouse model. After binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the plasma membrane, tau assemblies enter cells via macropinocytosis. From within a vesicle, if not trafficked to the endolysosomal system, tau subsequently enters the cytoplasm, where it becomes a template for its own replication, apparently after processing by valosin containing protein. The smallest seed unit is a stable monomer, which suggests that initial folding events in tau presage subsequent pathological aggregation. The study of tau prions has raised important questions about basic cell biological processes that underlie their replication and propagation, with implications for therapy of tauopathies.",2024,fluorescence; prion; tau; tauopathy,Mice; Animals; tau Proteins; Prions; Tauopathies; Cell Membrane; Cytoskeleton; Brain,"Diamond, MI"

"Tackling Dementia Together via The Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT): A Summary of Initiatives, Progress and Plans.","In 2018, the Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) was established to bring together Australia's leading dementia researchers, people with living experience and clinicians to transform research and clinical care in the field. To address dementia diagnosis, treatment, and care, ADNeT has established three core initiatives: the Clinical Quality Registry (CQR), Memory Clinics, and Screening for Trials. Collectively, the initiatives have developed an integrated clinical and research community, driving practice excellence in this field, leading to novel innovations in diagnostics, clinical care, professional development, quality and harmonization of healthcare, clinical trials, and translation of research into practice. Australia now has a national Registry for Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia with 55 participating clinical sites, an extensive map of memory clinic services, national Memory and Cognition Clinic Guidelines and specialized screening for trials sites in five states. This paper provides an overview of ADNeT's achievements to date and future directions. With the increase in dementia cases expected over coming decades, and with recent advances in plasma biomarkers and amyloid lowering therapies, the nationally coordinated initiatives and partnerships ADNeT has established are critical for increased national prevention efforts, co-ordinated implementation of emerging treatments for Alzheimer's disease, innovation of early and accurate diagnosis, driving continuous improvements in clinical care and patient outcome and access to post-diagnostic support and clinical trials.

High prevalence of renal salt wasting induced by haptoglobin-related protein without signal peptide is linked to new syndrome of salt wasting in Alzheimer disease.,"The subject of hyponatremia is undergoing significant changes after developing a more pathophysiologic approach that is superior to the ineffective volume approach and can more effectively identify the different causes of hyponatremia. This new approach identified cerebral salt wasting (CSW) in 24 (38%) of 62 hyponatremic patients from the medical wards of the hospital with 21 showing no evidence of cerebral disease to support our proposal to change CSW to renal salt wasting (RSW). RSW had to be differentiated from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) because of diametrically opposite therapeutic goals of water-restricting water-logged patients with SIADH or administering salt water to volume-depleted patients with RSW. Both syndromes present with identical clinical parameters that require a difficult protocol to make such a differentiation possible. We describe rat clearance studies demonstrating natriuretic activity in the plasma of patients with neurosurgical and Alzheimer diseases (AD) and eventually identify the protein as haptoglobin-related protein without signal peptide, which can serve as a biomarker to simplify diagnosis of RSW and delivery of the proper management to improve clinical outcomes. We also discuss the introduction of a new syndrome of RSW in AD and its implications. The high prevalence of RSW and identification of the natriuretic factor have created debates over the existence of RSW with none questioning or addressing the pathophysiologic data that identified patients with RSW. We also discuss the potentially large group of patients with RSW who are normonatremic.",2024,Cerebral salt wasting; Haptoglobin-related protein without signal peptide in renal salt wasting; Hyponatremia; Renal salt wasting; Renal salt wasting in Alzheimer disease,,"Maesaka, JK; Imbriano, LJ; Grant, C; Miyawaki, N"
High burdens of phosphorylated tau protein and distinct precuneus atrophy in sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is a rare devastating subclassification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). EOAD affects individuals <65 years old, and accounts for 5%-10% of all AD cases. Previous studies on EOAD primarily focused on familial forms, whereas research on sporadic EOAD (sEOAD), which represents 85%-90% of EOAD cases, is limited. In this prospective cohort study, participants were recruited between 2018 and 2023 and included patients with sEOAD (n = 110), late-onset AD (LOAD, n = 89), young controls (YC, n = 50), and older controls (OC, n = 25). All AD patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria based on biomarker evidence. Familial EOAD patients or non-AD dementia patients were excluded. Single molecule array technology was used to measure fluid biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, phosphorylated tau (P-tau) 181, total tau (T-tau), serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Patients with sEOAD exhibited more severe executive function impairment and bilateral precuneus atrophy (P < 0.05, family-wise error corrected) than patients with LOAD. Patients with sEOAD showed elevated CSF and plasma P-tau181 levels (154.0 ± 81.2 pg/mL, P = 0.002; and 6.1 ± 2.3 pg/mL, P = 0.046). Moreover, precuneus atrophy was significantly correlated with serum GFAP levels in sEOAD (P < 0.001). Serum GFAP levels (area under the curve (AUC) = 96.0%, cutoff value = 154.3 pg/mL) displayed excellent diagnostic value in distinguishing sEOAD patients from the control group. These preliminary findings highlight the crucial role of tau protein phosphorylation in the pathogenesis and progression of sEOAD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease; Familial hereditary; Phosphorylated tau; Precuneus,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Prospective Studies; Atrophy,"Lv, X; Cheng, Z; Wang, Q; Gao, F; Dai, L; Du, C; Liu, C; Xie, Q; Shen, Y; Shi, J"

Neuronal TIMP2 regulates hippocampus-dependent plasticity and extracellular matrix complexity.,"Functional output of the hippocampus, a brain region subserving memory function, depends on highly orchestrated cellular and molecular processes that regulate synaptic plasticity throughout life. The structural requirements of such plasticity and molecular events involved in this regulation are poorly understood. Specific molecules, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) have been implicated in plasticity processes in the hippocampus, a role that decreases with brain aging as expression is lost. Here, we report that TIMP2 is highly expressed by neurons within the hippocampus and its loss drives changes in cellular programs related to adult neurogenesis and dendritic spine turnover with corresponding impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory. Consistent with the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the hippocampus we observe with aging, we find that TIMP2 acts to reduce accumulation of ECM around synapses in the hippocampus. Moreover, its deletion results in hindrance of newborn neuron migration through a denser ECM network. A novel conditional TIMP2 knockout (KO) model reveals that neuronal TIMP2 regulates adult neurogenesis, accumulation of ECM, and ultimately hippocampus-dependent memory. Our results define a mechanism whereby hippocampus-dependent function is regulated by TIMP2 and its interactions with the ECM to regulate diverse processes associated with synaptic plasticity.",2023,,"Infant, Newborn; Humans; Neuronal Plasticity; Brain; Neurons; Hippocampus; Extracellular Matrix; Synapses; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2","Ferreira, AC; Hemmer, BM; Philippi, SM; Grau-Perales, AB; Rosenstadt, JL; Liu, H; Zhu, JD; Kareva, T; Ahfeldt, T; Varghese, M; Hof, PR; Castellano, JM"

Circulating metabolites and risk of incident dementia: A prospective cohort study.,"Identifying circulating metabolites associated with dementia, cognition, and brain volume may improve the understanding of dementia pathogenesis and provide novel insights for preventive and therapeutic interventions. This cohort study included a total of 87 885 participants (median follow-up of 9.1 years, 54% female) without dementia at baseline from the UK Biobank. A total of 249 plasma metabolites were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline. Cox proportional regression was used to examine the associations of each metabolite with incident dementia (cases = 1134), Alzheimer's disease (AD; cases = 488), and vascular dementia (VD; cases = 257) during follow-up. Dementia-associated metabolites were further analyzed for association with cognitive deficits (N = 87 885) and brain volume (N = 7756) using logistic regression and linear regression. We identified 26 metabolites associated with incident dementia, of which 6 were associated with incident AD and 5 were associated with incident VD. These 26 dementia-related metabolites were subfractions of intermediate-density lipoprotein, large low-density lipoprotein (L-LDL), small high-density lipoprotein (S-HDL), very-low-density lipoprotein, fatty acids, ketone bodies, citrate, glucose, and valine. Among them, the cholesterol percentage in L-LDL (L-LDL-C%) was associated with lower risk of AD (HR [95% CI] = 0.92 [0.87-0.97], p = 0.002), higher brain cortical (β = 0.047, p = 3.91 × 10",2023,Alzheimer's disease; dementia; lipoprotein; metabolites; prospective cohort,"Humans; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Cholesterol, LDL; Prospective Studies; Cholesterol; Lipoproteins, HDL; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors","Huang, SY; Zhang, YR; Yang, L; Li, YZ; Wu, BS; Chen, SD; Feng, JF; Dong, Q; Cheng, W; Yu, JT"
The association of body mass index and body composition with plasma amyloid beta levels.,"Blood-based analysis of amyloid-β is increasingly applied to incrementally establish diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's disease. To this aim, it is necessary to determine factors that can alter blood-based concentrations of amyloid-β. We cross-sectionally analysed amyloid-β-40 and amyloid-β-42 concentrations and the 40/42 ratio in 440 community-dwelling adults and associations with body mass index, waist-to-height ratio and body composition assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Body mass index and waist-to-height ratio were inversely associated with plasma amyloid-β-42 concentrations. Body fat mass, but not body cell mass and extracellular mass, was inversely associated with amyloid-β-42 levels. The results indicate that plasma concentrations of amyloid-β-42 are lower in those with increased body mass index and body fat, and associations with amyloid-β-40 did not reach significance after controlling for multiple testing. The findings support the use of body mass index as an easy-to-measure factor that should be accounted for in diagnostic models for plasma amyloid-β.",2023,amyloid beta; bioelectrical impedance analysis; body fat; body mass index; plasma,,"Hermesdorf, M; Esselmann, H; Morgado, B; Jahn-Brodmann, A; Herrera-Rivero, M; Wiltfang, J; Berger, K"

Peripheral Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of YKL-40 in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is particularly complicated, and early diagnosis and course monitoring of the disease are not ideal based on the available core biomarkers. As a biomarker closely related to neuroinflammation, YKL-40 provides a potential scalable approach in AD, but its association remains controversial and inconclusive with AD. We conducted this study to assess the utility of YKL-40 levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) by meta-analysis. We systematically searched and screened relevant trials for comparing YKL-40 levels between AD patients and HCs in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a search deadline of 14 March 2023 for each database. A total of 17 eligible and relevant studies involving 1811 subjects, including 949 AD patients and 862 HCs, were included. The results showed that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral blood of AD patients and HCs did not possess significant differences.

Associations Between Blood Nutritional Biomarkers and Cerebral Amyloid-β: Insights From the COGFRAIL Cohort Study.,"Understanding the relationship between blood nutrients and neurodegeneration could contribute to devising strategies for preventing Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the associations between fatty acids, vitamins D, B6, B12, folate, homocysteine, and the cerebral load of amyloid β (Aβ). This cross-sectional study included 177 older adults (70-96 years, 65% female) with objective cognitive impairment, prefrail, or frail. Cerebral Aβ load was determined using positron emission tomography Standardized Uptake Value ratios. Fatty acids were assessed in erythrocytes, vitamins D and homocysteine in serum, and the other vitamins in plasma. Linear regression models corrected for multiple comparisons evaluated the associations between each nutrient and Aβ. The principal component factor followed by linear regression grouped the fatty acids strongly correlated (factor) and associated with Aβ. Higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): clupanodonic acid (22:5n-3; β: -0.13; p = .001), mead acid (20:3n-9; β: -0.07; p = .036), and adrenic acid (22:4n-6; β: -0.05; p = .031) were associated with lower global Aβ load, whereas linoleic acid (18:2n-6) was associated with higher global Aβ load (β: 0.18; p = .042). Clupanodonic acid was inversely associated with Aβ in all cerebral regions except the thalamus. The factor composed of mead, clupanodonic, and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids was associated with a lower global Aβ load (β: -0.02; p = .002). Some erythrocyte PUFAs were inversely associated with Aβ load in the brain, and most of them were metabolites of the essential fatty acids linoleic and α-linolenic.

Blood Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The characteristic pathological manifestation of AD includes the deposition of extracellular insoluble β amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed from hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Cost effective and minimally invasive peripheral blood-based biomarkers are critical for early AD diagnosis. Currently, the plasma based two fraction of β amyloid peptide ratio (Aβ42/40) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are considered as blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Recent research indicates that oxidative stress (OS) occurs prior to amyloid plaque (Aβ) formation and abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD. The imbalance of the master antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), and prooxidants (iron, zinc, and copper)─plays a crucial role in AD neurodegeneration. We present peripheral blood-based OS related biomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the disease process and may serve as a novel screening tool for early detection of AD onset. This OS based approach may also provide a quick and cost efficient method to monitor the effects of disease-modifying therapies in AD clinical trials.",2023,"Alzheimer’s disease; antioxidants; biomarker; glutathione; oxidative stress; peripheral blood; prooxidants, iron",Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Biomarkers,"Mandal, PK; Maroon, JC; Garg, A; Arora, NK; Bansal, R; Kaushik, A; Samkaria, A; Kumaran, G; Arora, Y"

Plasma biomarkers predict Alzheimer's disease before clinical onset in Chinese cohorts.,"Plasma amyloid-β (Aβ)42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are promising biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We therefore tested the performance of these plasma biomarkers in 126 participants with preclinical AD and 123 controls with 8-10 years of follow-up from the China Cognition and Aging Study. Plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL were significantly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid counterparts and significantly altered in participants with preclinical AD. Combining plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL successfully discriminated preclinical AD from controls. These findings were validated in a replication cohort including 51 familial AD mutation carriers and 52 non-carriers from the Chinese Familial Alzheimer's Disease Network.

Sphingolipid metabolism in brain insulin resistance and neurological diseases.,"Sphingolipids, as members of the large lipid family, are important components of plasma membrane. Sphingolipids participate in biological signal transduction to regulate various important physiological processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sphingolipids are strongly associated with glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, including peripheral insulin resistance and brain insulin resistance, is closely related to the occurrence and development of many metabolic diseases. In addition to metabolic diseases, like type 2 diabetes, brain insulin resistance is also involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the specific mechanism of sphingolipids in brain insulin resistance has not been systematically summarized. This article reviews the involvement of sphingolipids in brain insulin resistance, highlighting the role and molecular biological mechanism of sphingolipid metabolism in cognitive dysfunctions and neuropathological abnormalities of the brain.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; brain insulin resistance; ceramide; sphingolipid metabolism; sphingosine-1-phosphate,"Humans; Insulin Resistance; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Sphingolipids; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain","Mei, M; Liu, M; Mei, Y; Zhao, J; Li, Y"

Histone deacetylase inhibitor attenuates the effects of 27-hydroxycholesterol on the rat brain.,"Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma cholesterol does not pass the blood-brain barrier whereas its metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) can enter the brain. High 27-OHC in the brain has been suggested to mediate hypercholesterolemia-induced impairments of learning and memory through promoting amyloid-β accumulation and facilitating synaptic disruption. In AD brains, the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is elevated. Treating AD animals with HDAC inhibitors decreases amyloid-β levels and synaptic damages, which leads to memory improvement. Whether HDAC activity is involved in the actions of 27-OHC is still uncertain. In this study, 4 weekly injections of 27-OHC/vehicle were given to rats followed by 3 daily injections of HDAC inhibitor trichostatin (TSA)/vehicle. The results of Morris water maze test reveal that all rats have intact spatial learning ability during the 5-d training phase. However, the behavioral performance during the probe trial was impaired by 27-OHC treatment, which was improved by adding TSA treatments. Furthermore, 27-OHC treatments reduced the hippocampal levels of acetylated histone H3, acetylated α tubulin, insulin-degrading enzyme and postsynaptic protein PSD-95, indicating that 27-OHC treatments may induce enhanced HDAC activity, decreased amyloid-β clearance and synaptic disruption. All reduced levels returned to the basal levels by adding TSA treatments. These findings support our hypothesis that HDAC activity is enhanced following long-term exposure to excess 27-OHC.",2024,27-hydroxycholesterol; Histone deacetylase; Morris water maze; Rat; Trichostatin,Animals; Rats; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Hydroxamic Acids; Hypercholesterolemia; Spatial Learning,"Chen, TJ; Hung, HS; Cheng, TL; Wang, DC"
Combining donepezil and memantine via mannosylated PLGA nanoparticles for intranasal delivery: Characterization and preclinical studies.,"The current work is focused on developing mannose-coated PLGA nanoparticles for delivering Donepezil and Memantine in one dosage form. The formulated nanoparticles were prepared using a simple emulsification technique. The final coated NPs exhibited 179.4 nm size and - 33.1 mV zeta potential and spherical shape. The concentration of IN-administrated MEM and DPZ mannose coated NPs in brain was ~573 and 207 ng/mL respectively. This amount accounts for 3 times more in comparison to uncoated NPs administered via intranasal and peroral routes. The plasma concentration of coated NPs administered via the intranasal route was various times less in comparison to other groups. In the field of pharmacodynamics, the administration of coated NPs via the IN route has shown superior efficacy in comparison to other groups in various investigations involving neurobehavioral assessments, gene expression analyses and biochemical estimations. The findings indicate that the IN route may be a potential avenue for delivering therapeutic agents using nanoparticles to treat neurological illnesses.

Recently, the involvement of RIPK1 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported; RIPK1 is involved in microglia's phenotypic transition to their dysfunctional states, and it is highly expressed in the neurons and microglia in the postmortem brains in AD patients. They prompt neurodegeneration leading to accumulations of pathological proteins in AD. Therefore, regulation of RIPK1 could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD, and in vivo imaging of RIPK1 may become a useful modality in studies of drug discovery and pathophysiology of AD.

Phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease.,"There is a need for blood biomarkers to detect individuals at different Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages because obtaining cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers is invasive and costly. Plasma phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau) have shown potential as such biomarkers. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), threonine 217 (p-tau217) and threonine 231 (p-tau231) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. All p-tau isoforms increase as a function of Aβ-accumulation and discriminate healthy individuals from those at preclinical AD stages with high accuracy. P-tau231 increases earliest, followed by p-tau181 and p-tau217. In advanced stages, all p-tau isoforms are associated with the clinical classification of AD and increase with disease severity, with the greatest increase seen for p-tau217. This is also reflected by a better correlation of p-tau217 with Aβ scans, whereas both, p-tau217 and p-tau181 correlated equally with tau scans. However, at the very advanced stages, p-tau181 begins to plateau, which may mirror the trajectory of the Aβ pathology and indicate an association with a more intermediate risk of AD. Across the AD continuum, the incremental increase in all biomarkers is associated with structural changes in widespread brain regions and underlying cognitive decline. Furthermore, all isoforms differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, making them specific for AD. Incorporating p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in clinical use requires further studies to examine ideal cut-points and harmonize assays.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; P-tau181; P-tau217; P-tau231; Phosphorylated tau; Plasma,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Protein Isoforms; tau Proteins; Threonine,"Telser, J; Grossmann, K; Wohlwend, N; Risch, L; Saely, CH; Werner, P"

"Discovery of novel multifunctional ligands targeting GABA transporters, butyrylcholinesterase, β-secretase, and amyloid β aggregation as potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health problem in the medical sector that will increase over time. The limited treatment of AD leads to the search for a new clinical candidate. Considering the multifactorial nature of AD, a strategy targeting number of regulatory proteins involved in the development of the disease is an effective approach. Here, we present a discovery of new multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs), purposely designed as GABA transporter (GAT) inhibitors, that successfully provide the inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), β-secretase (BACE1), amyloid β aggregation and calcium channel blockade activity.

The Impact of Hydroxytyrosol on the Metallomic-Profile in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"It is undeniable that as people get older, they become progressively more susceptible to neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memory loss is a prominent symptom of this condition and can be exacerbated by uneven levels of certain metals. This study used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to examine the levels of metals in the blood plasma, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of Wistar rats with AD induced by streptozotocin (STZ). It also tested the effects of the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol (HT) on metal levels. The Barnes maze behavior test was used, and the STZ group showed less certainty and greater distance when exploring the Barnes maze than the control group. The results also indicated that the control group and the STZ + HT group exhibited enhanced learning curves during the Barnes maze training as compared to the STZ group. The ICP-MS analysis showed that the STZ group had lower levels of cobalt in their blood plasma than the control group, while the calcium levels in the frontal cortex of the STZ + HT group were higher than in the control group. The most important finding was that copper levels in the frontal cortex from STZ-treated animals were higher than in the control group, and that the STZ + HT group returned to equivalent levels to the control group. The antioxidant HT can restore copper levels to their basal physiological state. This finding may help explain HT's potential beneficial effect in AD-patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; animal studies; copper; hydroxytyrosol; metallomics; zinc,"Humans; Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Rats, Wistar; Antioxidants; Copper; Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus; Streptozocin; Maze Learning","Tabanez, M; Santos, IR; Ikebara, JM; Camargo, MLM; Dos Santos, BA; Freire, BM; Batista, BL; Takada, SH; Squitti, R; Kihara, AH; Cerchiaro, G"
Altered Extracellular Vesicle miRNA Profile in Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized vesicles released by almost all body tissues, representing important mediators of cellular communication, and are thus promising candidate biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to isolate total EVs from plasma and characterize their microRNA (miRNA) contents in AD patients. We isolated total EVs from the plasma of all recruited subjects using ExoQuickULTRA exosome precipitation solution (SBI). Subsequently, circulating total EVs were characterized using Nanosight nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Western blotting. A panel of 754 miRNAs was determined with RT-qPCR using TaqMan OpenArray technology in a QuantStudio 12K System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The results demonstrated that plasma EVs showed widespread deregulation of specific miRNAs (miR-106a-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-19b-3p, miR-20a-5p, miR-223-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-296-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-532-3p, miR-92a-3p, and miR-451a), some of which were already known to be associated with neurological pathologies.

These transient species exhibit high structural and morphological heterogeneity. Protein oligomers can also propagate into β-sheet-rich filaments that braid and coil with other filaments to form amyloid fibrils and supramolecular structures with both flat and twisted morphologies.

Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer to Detect Plasma Membrane Perturbations in Giant Plasma Membrane Vesicles.,"Disruptions and perturbations of the cellular plasma membrane by peptides have garnered significant interest in the elucidation of biological phenomena. Typically, these complex processes are studied using liposomes as model membranes-either by encapsulating a fluorescent dye or by other spectroscopic approaches, such as nuclear magnetic resonance. Despite incorporating physiologically relevant lipids, no synthetic model truly recapitulates the full complexity and molecular diversity of the plasma membrane. Here, biologically representative membrane models, giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs), are prepared from eukaryotic cells by inducing a budding event with a chemical stressor. The GPMVs are then isolated, and bilayers are labelled with fluorescent lipophilic tracers and incubated in a microplate with a membrane-active peptide. As the membranes become damaged and/or aggregate, the resulting fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two tracers increases and is measured periodically in a microplate. This approach offers a particularly useful way to detect perturbations when the membrane complexity is an important variable to consider. Additionally, it provides a way to kinetically detect damage to the plasma membrane, which can be correlated with the kinetics of peptide self-assembly or structural rearrangements. Key features • Allows testing of various peptide-membrane interaction conditions (peptide:phospholipid ratio, ionic strength, buffer, etc.) at once. • Uses intact plasma membrane vesicles that can be prepared from a variety of cell lines. • Can offer comparable throughput as with traditional synthetic lipid models (e.g., dye-encapsulated liposomes).",2023,Amyloid; Cells; FRET; GPMV; Kinetics; Lipid vesicles; Membrane lytic peptides; Membrane perturbation; Microplate; Plasma membrane,,"Sebastiao, M; Quittot, N; Marcotte, I; Bourgault, S"

APPlications of amyloid-β precursor protein metabolites in macrocephaly and autism spectrum disorder.,"Metabolites of the Amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) proteolysis may underlie brain overgrowth in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have found elevated APP metabolites (total APP, secreted (s) APPα, and α-secretase adamalysins in the plasma and brain tissue of children with ASD). In this review, we highlight several lines of evidence supporting APP metabolites' potential contribution to macrocephaly in ASD. First, APP appears early in corticogenesis, placing APP in a prime position to accelerate growth in neurons and glia. APP metabolites are upregulated in neuroinflammation, another potential contributor to excessive brain growth in ASD. APP metabolites appear to directly affect translational signaling pathways, which have been linked to single gene forms of syndromic ASD (Fragile X Syndrome, PTEN, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex). Finally, APP metabolites, and microRNA, which regulates APP expression, may contribute to ASD brain overgrowth, particularly increased white matter, through ERK receptor activation on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/Rho GTPase pathway, favoring myelination.",2023,ASD; adamalysins; amyloid precursor protein; brain development; macrocephaly; overgrowth,,"Sokol, DK; Lahiri, DK"

Friends and Foes in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease. The prognosis is poor, and currently there are no proven effective therapies. Most likely, the etiology is related to cerebral inflammatory processes that cause neuronal damage, resulting in dysfunction and apoptosis of nerve cells. Pathogens that evoke a neuroinflammatory response, collectively activate astrocytes and microglia, which contributes to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This leads to the deposit of clustered fragments of beta-amyloid and misfolded tau proteins which do not elicit an adequate immune reaction. Apart from the function of astrocytes and microglia, molecular entities such as TREM2, SYK, C22, and C33 play a role in the physiopathology of AD. Furthermore, bacteria and viruses may trigger an overactive inflammatory response in the brain. Pathogens like Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (known for low-grade infection in the oral cavity) can release gingipains, which are enzymes that can damage and destroy neurons. Chronic infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (the causative agent of Lyme disease) can co-localize with tau tangles and amyloid deposits. As for viral infections, herpes simplex virus 1, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus can play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Present investigations have resulted in the development of antibodies that can clear the brain of beta-amyloid plaques. Trials with humanized aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab revealed limited success in AD patients. However, AD should be considered as a continuum in which the initial preclinical phase may take 10 or even 20 years. It is generally thought that this phase offers a window for efficacious treatment. Therefore, research is also focused on the identification of biomarkers for early AD detection. In this respect, the plasma measurement of neurofilament light chain in patients treated with hydromethylthionine mesylate may well open a new way to prevent the formation of tau tangles and represents the first treatment for AD at its roots.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Continuum; Neuroinflammation; Therapy,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Microglia","Pauwels, EKJ; Boer, GJ"
"Longitudinal associations of serum biomarkers with early cognitive, amyloid and grey matter changes.","Blood-based biomarkers have been extensively evaluated for their diagnostic potential in Alzheimer's disease. However, their relative prognostic and monitoring capabilities for cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and grey matter loss in cognitively unimpaired elderly require further investigation over extended time periods. This prospective cohort study in cognitively unimpaired elderly [n = 185, mean age (range) = 69 (53-84) years, 48% female] examined the prognostic and monitoring capabilities of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and phosphorylated tau (pTau)181 through their quantification in serum. All participants underwent baseline Aβ-PET, MRI and blood sampling as well as 2-yearly cognitive testing. A subset additionally underwent Aβ-PET (n = 109), MRI (n = 106) and blood sampling (n = 110) during follow-up [median time interval (range) = 6.1 (1.3-11.0) years]. Matching plasma measurements were available for Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and pTau181 (both n = 140). Linear mixed-effects models showed that high serum GFAP and NfL predicted future cognitive decline in memory (βGFAP×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.007 and βNfL×Time = -0.031, PFDR = 0.002) and language (βGFAP×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.002 and βNfL×Time = -0.018, PFDR = 0.03) domains. Low serum Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 equally but independently predicted memory decline (βAβ1-42/Aβ1-40×Time = -0.024, PFDR = 0.02). Whole-brain voxelwise analyses revealed that low Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 predicted Aβ accumulation within the precuneus and frontal regions, high GFAP and NfL predicted grey matter loss within hippocampal regions and low Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 predicted grey matter loss in lateral temporal regions. Serum GFAP, NfL and pTau181 increased over time, while Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 decreased only in Aβ-PET-negative elderly. NfL increases associated with declining memory (βNfLchange×Time = -0.030, PFDR = 0.006) and language (βNfLchange×Time = -0.021, PFDR = 0.02) function and serum Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 decreases associated with declining language function (βAβ1-42/Aβ1-40×Time = -0.020, PFDR = 0.04). GFAP increases associated with Aβ accumulation within the precuneus and NfL increases associated with grey matter loss. Baseline and longitudinal serum pTau181 only associated with Aβ accumulation in restricted occipital regions. In head-to-head comparisons, serum outperformed plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 (ΔAUC = 0.10, PDeLong, FDR = 0.04), while both plasma and serum pTau181 demonstrated poor performance to detect asymptomatic Aβ-PET positivity (AUC = 0.55 and 0.63, respectively). However, when measured with a more phospho-specific assay, plasma pTau181 detected Aβ-positivity with high performance (AUC = 0.82, PDeLong, FDR < 0.007). In conclusion, serum GFAP, NfL and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 are valuable prognostic and/or monitoring tools in asymptomatic stages providing complementary information in a time- and pathology-dependent manner.",2024,blood biomarkers; monitoring; positron emission tomography; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease; prognosis,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Gray Matter; Prospective Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Positron-Emission Tomography,"De Meyer, S; Blujdea, ER; Schaeverbeke, J; Reinartz, M; Luckett, ES; Adamczuk, K; Van Laere, K; Dupont, P; Teunissen, CE; Vandenberghe, R; Poesen, K"

"Melatonin-mediated IGF-1/GLP-1 activation in experimental OCD rats: Evidence from CSF, blood plasma, brain and in-silico investigations.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts and behaviors. Our study uses a validated 8-OH-DPAT-induced experimental model of OCD in rodents. We focus on the modulatory effects of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which are linked to neurodevelopment and survival. Current research investigates melatonin, a molecule with neuroprotective properties and multiple functions. Melatonin has beneficial effects on various illnesses, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and depression, indicating its potential efficacy in treating OCD. In the present study, we employed two doses of melatonin, 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, demonstrating a dose-dependent effect on 8-OH-DPAT-induced rat changes. In addition, the melatonin antagonist luzindole 5 mg/kg was utilized to compare and validate the efficacy of melatonin. In-silico studies alsocontribute to understanding the activation of IGF-1/GLP-1 pathways by melatonin. Current research indicates restoring neurochemical measurements on various biological samples (brain homogenates, CSF, and blood plasma) and morphological and histological analyses. In addition, the current research seeks to increase understanding of OCD and investigate potential new treatment strategies. Therefore, it is evident from the aforementioned research that the protective effect of melatonin can serve as a strong basis for developing a new OCD treatment by upregulating IGF-1 and GLP-1 levels. The primary focus of current study revolves around the examination of melatonin as an activator of IGF-1/GLP-1, with the aim of potentially mitigating behavioral, neurochemical, and histopathological abnormalities in an experimental model of obsessive-compulsive disorder caused by 8-OH-DPAT in adult Wistar rats.",2023,CSTC pathway; Luzindole; Melatonin; Neuroprotection; OCD,"Rats; Animals; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Melatonin; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin; Rats, Wistar; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Brain; Plasma","Giri, A; Mehan, S; Khan, Z; Gupta, GD; Narula, AS"

Intrathecal autologous thrombin-activated condensed platelet cytokines in chronic neurodegenerative disease: A hypothesis for anti-inflammatory and regenerative response.,"Choroid plexus insufficiency or glymphatic stasis are often classified as prequels to harmful accretion of toxic proteins in neurodegenerative disease. Cognitive decline and disordered neuronal signaling subsequently become cardinal features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), typically progressing with amyloid-ß and tau protein accumulation. For Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein deposits and dopamine depletion are linked to impaired movement, resting tremor, and rigidity. Importantly, both diagnoses feature hyperinflammation and intrathecal cytokine changes. Thus far, numerous clinical trials have produced nothing effective for AD or PD, yet the anti-inflammatory and regenerative potential of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) remains largely unexamined in this context. Our report explores a proposed Phase I study on intrathecal condensed plasma growth factors processed from thrombin-activated PRP as monotherapy for AD or PD. The concept gains support from related work where cytokines of platelet origin successfully lowered inflammation, corrected background fibrosis, deactivated abnormal cells, and recovered local tissue function-all desirable outcomes in AD and PD. While PRP-mediated effects on membrane potentials, cellular signaling, electrolyte balance, and water clearance are less well characterized, experimental data suggest these pathways could likewise influence glymphatic drainage to ameliorate proteinopathies. As a well-tolerated 'orthobiologic' with no hypersensitivity risk, intrathecal PRP and its derivatives bring advantages over synthetic pharmaceuticals. If age-associated neuroinflammation in AD and PD is an upstream event inciting or contributing to neural disruption, then dampening local oxidative stress by a patient's own platelet cytokines (successful in other contexts) could offer therapeutic relevance to these neurodegenerative conditions as well.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Chronic Disease; Cytokines; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Thrombin; Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic","Sills, ES; Chu, HI; Wang, JW; Wood, SH; Tan, SL"

Microglial-Targeted nSMase2 Inhibitor Fails to Reduce Tau Propagation in PS19 Mice.,"The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with the propagation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and neocortex. Neutral sphingomyelinase2 (nSMase2) is critical in the biosynthesis of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which play a role in pTau propagation. We recently conjugated DPTIP, a potent nSMase2 inhibitor, to hydroxyl-PAMAM-dendrimer nanoparticles that can improve brain delivery. We showed that dendrimer-conjugated DPTIP (D-DPTIP) robustly inhibited the spread of pTau in an AAV-pTau propagation model. To further evaluate its efficacy, we tested D-DPTIP in the PS19 transgenic mouse model. Unexpectantly, D-DPTIP showed no beneficial effect. To understand this discrepancy, we assessed D-DPTIP's brain localization. Using immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting, D-DPTIP was found to be primarily internalized by microglia, where it selectively inhibited microglial nSMase2 activity with no effect on other cell types. Furthermore, D-DPTIP inhibited microglia-derived EV release into plasma without affecting other brain-derived EVs. We hypothesize that microglial targeting allowed D-DPTIP to inhibit tau propagation in the AAV-hTau model, where microglial EVs play a central role in propagation. However, in PS19 mice, where tau propagation is independent of microglial EVs, it had a limited effect. Our findings confirm microglial targeting with hydroxyl-PAMAM dendrimers and highlight the importance of understanding cell-specific mechanisms when designing targeted AD therapies.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; D-DPTIP; DPTIP; extracellular vesicles; hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer; neutral sphingomyelinase 2; tau,,"Huang, M; Tallon, C; Zhu, X; Huizar, KDJ; Picciolini, S; Thomas, AG; Tenora, L; Liyanage, W; Rodà, F; Gualerzi, A; Kannan, RM; Bedoni, M; Rais, R; Slusher, BS"
"Morphometric and Nanomechanical Screening of Peripheral Blood Cells with Atomic Force Microscopy for Label-Free Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.","Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are complex, multifactorial disorders with significant social and economic impact in today's society. NDDs are predicted to become the second-most common cause of death in the next few decades due to an increase in life expectancy but also to a lack of early diagnosis and mainly symptomatic treatment. Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic methods, there are yet no reliable biomarkers identifying the complex pathways contributing to these pathologies. The development of new approaches for early diagnosis and new therapies, together with the identification of non-invasive and more cost-effective diagnostic biomarkers, is one of the main trends in NDD biomedical research. Here we summarize data on peripheral biomarkers, biofluids (cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma), and peripheral blood cells (platelets (PLTs) and red blood cells (RBCs)), reported so far for the three most common NDDs-Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PLTs and RBCs, beyond their primary physiological functions, are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of biomarkers for NDDs. Special attention is given to the morphological and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and RBCs as biophysical markers for the three pathologies. Modifications of the surface nanostructure and morphometric and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and RBCs from patients with AD, PD, and ALS have been revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is currently experiencing rapid and widespread adoption in biomedicine and clinical medicine, in particular for early diagnostics of various medical conditions. AFM is a unique instrument without an analog, allowing the generation of three-dimensional cell images with extremely high spatial resolution at near-atomic scale, which are complemented by insights into the mechanical properties of cells and subcellular structures. Data demonstrate that AFM can distinguish between the three pathologies and the normal, healthy state. The specific PLT and RBC signatures can serve as biomarkers in combination with the currently used diagnostic tools. We highlight the strong correlation of the morphological and nanomechanical signatures between RBCs and PLTs in PD, ALS, and AD.",2023,atomic force microscopy; biomarkers; cell morphology; cell nanomechanics; neurodegenerative disorders; platelets; red blood cells,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Alzheimer Disease; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Blood Cells","Taneva, SG; Todinova, S; Andreeva, T"

Plasma Neurofilament Light Chains as Blood-Based Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome.,"The number of elderly dogs is increasing significantly worldwide, and many elderly dogs develop canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CCDS). CCDS is the canine analog of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. It is very important to develop techniques for detecting CDDS in dogs. Thus, we used the detection of neurofilament light chains (NfL) in plasma as a blood-based biomarker for the early diagnosis of canine Alzheimer's disease using immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) technology by immobilizing NfL antibodies on magnetic nanoparticles. According to the 50-point CCDS rating scale, we divided 36 dogs into 15 with CCDS and 21 without the disease. The results of our IMR assay showed that the plasma NfL levels of dogs with CCDS were significantly increased compared to normal dogs (",2023,canine; cognitive dysfunction; immunomagnetic reduction; neurofilament light chain,,"Wu, CH; Pan, XS; Su, LY; Yang, SY"
"Why Is Iron Deficiency/Anemia Linked to Alzheimer's Disease and Its Comorbidities, and How Is It Prevented?","Impaired iron metabolism has been increasingly observed in many diseases, but a deeper, mechanistic understanding of the cellular impact of altered iron metabolism is still lacking. In addition, deficits in neuronal energy metabolism due to reduced glucose import were described for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its comorbidities like obesity, depression, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this review is to present the molecular link between both observations. Insufficient cellular glucose uptake triggers increased ferritin expression, leading to depletion of the cellular free iron pool and stabilization of the hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) 1α. This transcription factor induces the expression of the glucose transporters (Glut) 1 and 3 and shifts the cellular metabolism towards glycolysis. If this first line of defense is not adequate for sufficient glucose supply, further reduction of the intracellular iron pool affects the enzymes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and activates the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). This enzyme triggers the translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane as well as the autophagic recycling of cell components in order to mobilize energy resources. Moreover, AMPK activates the autophagic process of ferritinophagy, which provides free iron urgently needed as a cofactor for the synthesis of heme- and iron-sulfur proteins. Excessive activation of this pathway ends in ferroptosis, a special iron-dependent form of cell death, while hampered AMPK activation steadily reduces the iron pools, leading to hypoferremia with iron sequestration in the spleen and liver. Long-lasting iron depletion affects erythropoiesis and results in anemia of chronic disease, a common condition in patients with AD and its comorbidities. Instead of iron supplementation, drugs, diet, or phytochemicals that improve energy supply and cellular glucose uptake should be administered to counteract hypoferremia and anemia of chronic disease.",2023,COVID-19; HIF1α; ferritin; gingko biloba; glucose transporter; hydrogen sulfide; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome,,"Fehsel, K"
Concordant and Discordant Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma Cytokine and Chemokine Responses in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease.,"Neuroinflammation may be a pathogenic mediator and biomarker of neurodegeneration at the boundary between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether neuroinflammatory processes are endogenous to the central nervous system (CNS) or originate from systemic (peripheral blood) sources could impact strategies for therapeutic intervention. To address this issue, we measured cytokine and chemokine immunoreactivities in simultaneously obtained lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 39 patients including 18 with MCI or early AD and 21 normal controls using a 27-plex XMAP bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

If validated in racialized groups, plasma AD biomarkers and measures of subtle cognitive dysfunction could provide avenues to expand diversity in preclinical AD research.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with lowered cognitive recovery among acute ischemic stroke patients with mild cognitive impairment.,"High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been documented to be related to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia occurrence; however, the underlying basis behind this association remains unclear. We aimed to elucidate this basis by examining the association between HDL levels and cognitive improvements after 6 months, among acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with MCI. Five hundred fifty-eight AIS and MCI patients from the NICE study were enrolled, and divided into four groups, according to their baseline HDL quartiles; median HDL was 1.12 mmol/L (interquartile range 0.96-1.34 mmol/L). The primary outcome examined was the extent of cognitive improvement, defined as ΔMoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) ≥ 2, while the secondary outcome was cognitive deterioration, defined as ΔADAS-cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) ≥ 4 or ΔMMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) ≤ - 3, at 6-months post-AIS. We found that 314 (56.27%), 49 (8.78%), and 31 (5.56%) patients had ΔMoCA ≥ 2, ΔADAS-cog ≥ 4, and ΔMMSE ≤ - 3, respectively. Furthermore, cognitive improvement negatively correlated to HDL levels, with the lowest being present among patients in quartiles 4 (Q4; adjusted OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.25-0.78, P = 0.0050) and Q3 (OR = 0.38, CI 0.23-0.65, P = 0.0004), compared to Q2 (OR = 0.57, CI 0.34-0.96, P = 0.0331). Q2 patients also had positive correlations with ΔADAS-cog ≥ 4 (OR = 5.18, CI 1.55-17.29, P = 0.0074). However, no association between HDL and ΔMMSE ≤ - 3 was observed, nor with LDL and any cognitive changes. Additionally, restricted cubic spline analysis found a nonlinear relationship between HDL and cognitive improvements. All these findings suggested that low plasma HDL was positively associated with improved cognitive functioning among AIS patients with MCI after 6 months.",2024,Acute ischemic stroke; Cognitive decline; High-density lipoprotein; Mild cognitive impairment,"Humans; Cholesterol, HDL; Ischemic Stroke; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognition; Lipoproteins, HDL; Stroke; Risk Factors","Wang, R; Jiao, Z; Wang, A; Zhang, Y; Hong, X; Huang, S; Fu, J; Zhou, Y; Wang, Y; Li, C; Liu, Y; Wei, K; Meng, X; Xu, J"

Associations between physical activity levels and ATPase inhibitory factor 1 concentrations in older adults.,"Adenosine triphosphatase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is a key protein involved in energy metabolism. IF1 has been linked to various age-related diseases, although its relationship with physical activity (PA) remains unclear. Additionally, the apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a PA-modulated lipoprotein, could play a role in this relationship because it shares a binding site with IF1 on the cell-surface ATP synthase.

Native ultrastructure of fresh human brain vitrified directly from autopsy revealed by cryo-electron tomography with cryo-plasma focused ion beam milling.,"Ultrastructure of human brain tissue has traditionally been examined using electron microscopy (EM) following chemical fixation, staining, and mechanical sectioning, which limit attainable resolution and introduce artifacts. Alternatively, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) offers the potential to image unfixed cellular samples at higher resolution while preserving their native structures, but it requires samples to be frozen free from crystalline ice and thin enough to image via transmission EM. Due to these requirements, cryo-ET has yet to be employed to investigate the native ultrastructure of unfixed, never previously frozen human brain tissue. Here we present a method for generating lamellae in human brain tissue obtained at time of autopsy that can be imaged via cryo-ET. We vitrify the tissue directly on cryo-EM grids via plunge-freezing, as opposed to high pressure freezing which is generally used for thick samples. Following vitrification, we use xenon plasma focused ion beam (FIB) milling to generate lamellae directly on-grid. In comparison to gallium FIB, which is commonly used for biological samples, xenon plasma FIB is powerful enough to efficiently mill large volume samples, such as human brain tissue. Additionally, our approach allows for lamellae to be generated at variable depth inside the tissue as opposed to being limited to starting at the surface of the tissue. Lamellae generated in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue and imaged by cryo-ET reveal intact subcellular structures including components of autophagy and potential tau fibrils. Furthermore, we visualize myelin revealing intact compact myelin and functional cytoplasmic expansions such as cytoplasmic channels and the inner tongue. From these images we also measure the dimensions of myelin membranes, providing insight into how myelin basic protein forces out oligodendrocyte cytoplasm to form compact myelin and tightly links intracellular polar head groups of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane. This approach provides a first view of unfixed, never previously frozen human brain tissue prepared by cryo-plasma FIB milling and imaged at high resolution by cryo-ET.",2023,,,"Creekmore, BC; Kixmoeller, K; Black, BE; Lee, EB; Chang, YW"
Lipid peroxidation drives liquid-liquid phase separation and disrupts raft protein partitioning in biological membranes.,"The peroxidation of membrane lipids by free radicals contributes to aging, numerous diseases, and ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. Peroxidation changes the structure, conformation and physicochemical properties of lipids, leading to major membrane alterations including bilayer thinning, altered fluidity, and increased permeability. Whether and how lipid peroxidation impacts the lateral organization of proteins and lipids in biological membranes, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we employ cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) as a model to investigate the impact of lipid peroxidation on ordered membrane domains, often termed membrane rafts. We show that lipid peroxidation induced by the Fenton reaction dramatically enhances phase separation propensity of GPMVs into co-existing liquid ordered (raft) and liquid disordered (non-raft) domains and increases the relative abundance of the disordered, non-raft phase. Peroxidation also leads to preferential accumulation of peroxidized lipids and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts in the disordered phase, decreased lipid packing in both raft and non-raft domains, and translocation of multiple classes of proteins out of rafts. These findings indicate that peroxidation of plasma membrane lipids disturbs many aspects of membrane rafts, including their stability, abundance, packing, and protein and lipid composition. We propose that these disruptions contribute to the pathological consequences of lipid peroxidation during aging and disease, and thus serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",2023,4-HNE; Alzheimer’s disease; ferroptosis; lipid peroxidation; liquid ordered domains; membrane proteins; membrane rafts,,"Balakrishnan, M; Kenworthy, AK"
"Phytanic acid, an inconclusive phytol metabolite: A review.","Phytanic acid (PA: 3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) is an important biometabolite of the chlorophyll-derived diterpenoid phytol. Its biological sources (occurrence) and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) profile are well-discussed in the literature. Cumulative literature suggests that PA has beneficial as well as harmful biological roles in humans and other animals. This study aimed to sketch a brief summary of PA's beneficial and harmful pharmacological effects in test systems on the basis of existing literature reports. Literature findings propose that PA has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, anticancer, and oocyte maturation effects. Although a high plasma PA-level mediated SLS remains controversial, it is evident to link it with Refsum's disease and other peroxisomal enzyme deficiency diseases in humans, including RCDP and LD; ZHDA and Alzheimer's disease; progressive ataxia and dysarthria; and an increased risk of some lymphomas such as LBL, FL, and NHL.

Caloric Restriction Intervention Alters Specific Circulating Biomarkers of the Senescence-Associated Secretome in Middle-Aged and Older Adults With Obesity and Prediabetes in an 18-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Cellular senescence is a biological aging process that is exacerbated by obesity and leads to inflammation and age- and obesogenic-driven chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes. Caloric restriction (CR) may improve metabolic function in part by reducing cellular senescence and the pro-inflammatory senescence-associated phenotype (SASP). We conducted an ancillary investigation of an 18-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of CR (n = 31) or Control (n = 27) in 58 middle-aged/older adults (57.6 ± 5.8 years; 75% Women) with obesity and prediabetes. We measured mRNA expression of select senescence and apoptosis genes in blood CD3 + T cells (qRT-PCR) and a panel of 25 plasma SASP proteins (Luminex/multiplex; ELISA). Participants randomized to CR lost -10.8 ± 0.9 kg (-11.3% ± 5.4%) over 18 weeks compared with +0.5 ± 0.9 kg (+0.03% ± 3.5%) in Control group. T-cell expression of senescence biomarkers, p16INK4a and p21CIP1/WAF1, and apoptosis markers, BCL2L1 and BAK1, was not different between CR and Control groups in age, race, and sex-adjusted mixed models (p > .05, all). Iterative principal axis factor analysis was used to develop composite SASP Factors, and the Factors comprising TNFRI, TNFRII, uPAR, MMP1, GDF15, OPN, Fas, and MPO were significantly altered with CR intervention (age, sex, race-adjusted mixed model time × treatment F = 4.17, p ≤ .05) and associated with the degree of weight loss (R2 = 0.12, p ≤ .05).

Galantamine-memantine hybrids for Alzheimer's disease: The influence of linker rigidity in biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties.,"Neurodegenerative processes characterizing Alzheimer's disease (AD) are strictly related to the impairment of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems which provoke synaptic loss. These experimental evidences still represent the foundation of the actual standard-of-care treatment for AD, albeit palliative, consisting on the coadministration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and the NMDAR antagonist memantine. In looking for more effective treatments, we previously developed a series of galantamine-memantine hybrids where compound 1 (ARN14140) emerged with the best-balanced action toward the targets of interest paired to neuroprotective efficacy in a murine AD model. Unfortunately, it showed a suboptimal pharmacokinetic profile, which required intracerebroventricular administration for in vivo studies. In this work we designed and synthesized new hybrids with fewer rotatable bonds, which is related to higher brain exposure. Particularly, compound 2, bearing a double bond in the tether, ameliorated the biological profile of compound 1 in invitro studies, increasing cholinesterases inhibitory potencies and selective antagonism toward excitotoxic-related GluN1/2B NMDAR over beneficial GluN1/2A NMDAR. Furthermore, it showed increased plasma stability and comparable microsomal stability in vitro, paired with lower half-life and faster clearance in vivo. Remarkably, pharmacokinetic evaluations of compound 2 showed a promising increase in brain uptake in comparison to compound 1, representing the starting point for further chemical optimizations.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Cholinesterases; Drug conjugate; Galantamine; Memantine; NMDAR,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Galantamine; Memantine; Alzheimer Disease; Acetylcholinesterase; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate","Basagni, F; Ortega, JA; Bertozzi, SM; Armirotti, A; Summa, M; Bertorelli, R; Bartolini, M; Mellor, IR; Bedeschi, M; Bottegoni, G; Lembo, V; Minarini, A; Cavalli, A; Rosini, M"

Neuroimaging in Dementia: More than Typical Alzheimer Disease.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. The prevailing theory of the underlying pathology assumes amyloid accumulation followed by tau protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. However, the current antiamyloid and antitau treatments show only variable clinical efficacy. Three relevant points are important for the radiologic assessment of dementia. First, besides various dementing disorders (including AD, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies), clinical variants and imaging subtypes of AD include both typical and atypical AD. Second, atypical AD has overlapping radiologic and clinical findings with other disorders. Third, the diagnostic process should consider mixed pathologies in neurodegeneration, especially concurrent cerebrovascular disease, which is frequent in older age. Neuronal loss is often present at, or even before, the onset of cognitive decline. Thus, for effective emerging treatments, early diagnosis before the onset of clinical symptoms is essential to slow down or stop subsequent neuronal loss, requiring molecular imaging or plasma biomarkers. Neuroimaging, particularly MRI, provides multiple imaging parameters for neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease. With emerging treatments for AD, it is increasingly important to recognize AD variants and other disorders that mimic AD. Describing the individual composition of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease markers while considering overlapping and mixed diseases is necessary to better understand AD and develop efficient individualized therapies.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Molecular Imaging; Radiology,"Haller, S; Jäger, HR; Vernooij, MW; Barkhof, F"

Comparative study of Raman spectroscopy techniques in blood plasma-based clinical diagnostics: A demonstration on Alzheimer's disease.,"Nowadays, there are still many diseases with limited or no reliable methods of early diagnosis. A popular approach in clinical diagnostic research is Raman spectroscopy, as a relatively simple, cost-effective, and high-throughput method for searching for disease-specific alterations in the composition of blood plasma. However, the high variability of the experimental designs, targeted diseases, or statistical processing in the individual studies makes it challenging to compare and compile the results to critically assess the applicability of Raman spectroscopy in real clinical practice. This study aimed to compare data from a single series of blood plasma samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease and non-demented elderly controls obtained by four different techniques/experimental setups - Raman spectroscopy with excitation at 532 and 785 nm, Raman optical activity, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy. The obtained results showed that the spectra from each Raman spectroscopy technique contain different information about biomolecules of blood plasma or their conformation and may, therefore, offer diverse points of view on underlying biochemical processes of the disease. The classification models based on the datasets generated by the three non-chiroptical variants of Raman spectroscopy exhibited comparable diagnostic performance, all reaching an accuracy close to or equal to 80%. Raman optical activity achieved only 60% classification accuracy, suggesting its limited applicability in the specific case of Alzheimer's disease diagnostics. The described differences in the outputs of the four utilized techniques/setups of Raman spectroscopy imply that their choice may crucially affect the acquired results and thus should be approached carefully concerning the specific purpose.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Blood plasma; Diagnostics; Raman optical activity; Raman spectroscopy; Surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy,,"Kralova, K; Kral, M; Vrtelka, O; Setnicka, V"

Research progress on the role of extracellular vesicles in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, affect millions of people worldwide. Tremendous efforts have been put into disease-related research, but few breakthroughs have been made in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous cell-derived membrane structures that arise from the endosomal system or are directly separated from the plasma membrane. EVs contain many biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which can be transferred between different cells, tissues, or organs, thereby regulating cross-organ communication between cells during normal and pathological processes. Recently, EVs have been shown to participate in various aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Abnormal secretion and levels of EVs are closely related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to disease progression. Numerous studies have proposed EVs as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize and discuss the advanced research progress on EVs in the pathological processes of several neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we outline the latest research on the roles of EVs in neurodegenerative diseases and their therapeutic potential for the diseases.",2023,Biomarker; Central nervous system; Extracellular vesicle; Neurodegeneration; Neurodegenerative disease; Pathogenesis,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Extracellular Vesicles; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,"Li, Z; Wang, X; Wang, X; Yi, X; Wong, YK; Wu, J; Xie, F; Hu, D; Wang, Q; Wang, J; Zhong, T"

Plasma MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio serves as a novel potential biomarker in Alzheimer's disease.,"This study aimed to explore the diagnostic potential of plasma MMP-9, TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This retrospective study was performed in a cohort consisting of patients with AD (AD group) and cognitive normal subjects (HC group). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) classic biomarkers including Aβ42, Aβ40, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels, and plasma MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were measured by commercially available ELISA kits, respectively. The differential diagnostic potential of plasma MMP-9, TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. It was observed that significantly elevated levels of plasma MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio in patients with AD than HC. Both MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios were negatively correlated with CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and positively correlated with CSF p-tau in AD group. ROC curve analysis showed better diagnostic accuracy of MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio than MMP-9 for AD at a cutoff value of 1.35 with an area under the curve of 0.906 and sensitivity and specificity of 95.8% and 75%, respectively.

Using Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins as Potential Biomarkers to Discriminate between Parkinson's Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies: Exploration of a Novel Technique.,"An increase in the global aging population is leading to an increase in age-related conditions such as dementia and movement disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The accurate prediction of risk factors associated with these disorders is crucial for early diagnosis and prevention. Biomarkers play a significant role in diagnosing and monitoring diseases. In neurodegenerative disorders like α-synucleinopathies, specific biomarkers can indicate the presence and progression of disease. We previously demonstrated the pathogenic impact of fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) in α-synucleinopathies. Therefore, this study investigated FABPs as potential biomarkers for Lewy body diseases. Plasma FABP levels were measured in patients with AD, PD, DLB, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Plasma FABP3 was increased in all groups, while the levels of FABP5 and FABP7 tended to decrease in the AD group. Additionally, FABP2 levels were elevated in PD. A correlation analysis showed that higher FABP3 levels were associated with decreased cognitive function. The plasma concentrations of Tau, GFAP, NF-L, and UCHL1 correlated with cognitive decline. A scoring method was applied to discriminate between diseases, demonstrating high accuracy in distinguishing MCI vs. CN, AD vs. DLB, PD vs. DLB, and AD vs. PD. The study suggests that FABPs could serve as potential biomarkers for Lewy body diseases and aid in early disease detection and differentiation.",2023,Parkinson’s disease; biomarkers; dementia; dementia with Lewy bodies; diagnosis; discrimination technique; fatty acid-binding proteins; α-synucleinopathies,Humans; Aged; Parkinson Disease; Lewy Bodies; Synucleinopathies; Lewy Body Disease; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers,"Kawahata, I; Sekimori, T; Oizumi, H; Takeda, A; Fukunaga, K"
Identification of Plasma Proteins as Biomarkers for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease Using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"Blood proteins can be used for biomarkers to monitor the progression of cognitive decline, even in the early stages of disease. In this study, we developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based blood test to identify plasma proteins that can be used to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using this system, we quantified plasma proteins using isotope-labeled synthetic peptides. A total of 192 patients, including 63 with AD, 71 with MCI, and 58 non-demented controls (NDCs), were analyzed. Multinomial regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to identify specific combinations of plasma protein panels that could differentiate among NDCs, those with MCI, and those with AD. We identified eight plasma protein biomarker candidates that can be used to distinguish between MCI and AD. These biomarkers were associated with coagulation pathways, innate immunity, lipid metabolism, and nutrition. The clinical potential to differentiate cognitive impairment from NDC was assessed using area under the curve values from ROC analysis, which yielded values of 0.83 for males and 0.71 for females. This LC-MS-based plasma protein panel allows the pathophysiology of AD to be followed through detection of cognitive decline and disease progression markers.",2023,biomarker; dementia prevention; mass spectrometry; multiple reaction monitoring; proteomics,"Female; Male; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Chromatography, Liquid; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Blood Proteins","Inoue, M; Suzuki, H; Meno, K; Liu, S; Korenaga, T; Uchida, K"

Integrative blood-based characterization of oxidative mitochondrial DNA damage variants implicates Mexican American's metabolic risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continues to be a leading cause of death in the US. As the US aging population (ages 65 +) expands, the impact will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, e.g., Hispanic/Latino population, due to their AD-related health disparities. Age-related regression in mitochondrial activity and ethnic-specific differences in metabolic burden could potentially explain in part the racial/ethnic distinctions in etiology that exist for AD. Oxidation of guanine (G) to 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG) is a prevalent lesion and an indicator of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Damaged mtDNA (8oxoG) can serve as an important marker of age-related systemic metabolic dysfunction and upon release into peripheral circulation may exacerbate pathophysiology contributing to AD development and/or progression. Analyzing blood samples from Mexican American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants enrolled in the Texas Alzheimer's Research & Care Consortium, we used blood-based measurements of 8oxoG from both buffy coat PBMCs and plasma to determine associations with population, sex, type-2 diabetes, and AD risk. Our results show that 8oxoG levels in both buffy coat and plasma were significantly associated with population, sex, years of education, and reveal a potential association with AD. Furthermore, MAs are significantly burdened by mtDNA oxidative damage in both blood fractions, which may contribute to their metabolic vulnerability to developing AD.",2023,,"Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; DNA, Mitochondrial; Guanine; Mexican Americans; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; DNA Damage; White","Reid, DM; Barber, RC; Jones, HP; Thorpe, RJ; Sun, J; Zhou, Z; Phillips, NR"

Genome-wide analysis identifies novel loci influencing plasma apolipoprotein E concentration and Alzheimer's disease risk.,"The APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This polymorphism is also associated with variation in plasma ApoE level; while APOE*4 lowers, APOE*2 increases ApoE level. Lower plasma ApoE level has also been suggested to be a risk factor for incident dementia. To our knowledge, no large genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been reported on plasma ApoE level. This study aimed to identify new genetic variants affecting plasma ApoE level as well as to test if baseline ApoE level is associated with cognitive function and incident dementia in a longitudinally followed cohort of the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study. Baseline plasma ApoE concentration was measured in 3031 participants (95.4% European Americans (EAs)). GWAS analysis was performed on 2580 self-identified EAs where both genotype and plasma ApoE data were available. Lower ApoE concentration was associated with worse cognitive function, but not with incident dementia. As expected, the risk for AD increased from E2/2 through to E4/4 genotypes (P for trend = 4.8E-75). In addition to confirming the expected and opposite associations of APOE*2 (P = 4.73E-79) and APOE*4 (P = 8.73E-12) with ApoE level, GWAS analysis revealed nine additional independent signals in the APOE region, and together they explained about 22% of the variance in plasma ApoE level. We also identified seven new loci on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12 and 20 (P range = 5.49E-08 to 5.36E-10) that explained about 9% of the variance in ApoE level. Plasma ApoE level-associated independent variants, especially in the APOE region, were also associated with AD risk and amyloid deposition in the brain, indicating that genetically determined ApoE level variation may be a risk factor for developing AD. These results improve our understanding of the genetic determinants of plasma ApoE level and their potential value in affecting AD risk.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Apolipoproteins E; Genotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Apolipoprotein E4","Aslam, MM; Fan, KH; Lawrence, E; Bedison, MA; Snitz, BE; DeKosky, ST; Lopez, OL; Feingold, E; Kamboh, MI"
Elevated plasma sclerostin is associated with high brain amyloid-β load in cognitively normal older adults.,"Osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) mainly affect older individuals, and the possibility of an underlying link contributing to their shared epidemiological features has rarely been investigated. In the current study, we investigated the association between levels of plasma sclerostin (SOST), a protein primarily produced by bone, and brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) load, a pathological hallmark of AD. The study enrolled participants meeting a set of screening inclusion and exclusion criteria and were stratified into Aβ- (n = 65) and Aβ+ (n = 35) according to their brain Aβ load assessed using Aβ-PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Plasma SOST levels, apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) genotype and several putative AD blood-biomarkers including Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40, neurofilament light (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181 and p-tau231) were detected and compared. It was found that plasma SOST levels were significantly higher in the Aβ+ group (71.49 ± 25.00 pmol/L) compared with the Aβ- group (56.51 ± 22.14 pmol/L) (P < 0.01). Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis showed that plasma SOST concentrations were positively correlated with brain Aβ load (ρ = 0.321, P = 0.001). Importantly, plasma SOST combined with Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio significantly increased the area under the curve (AUC) when compared with using Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio alone (AUC = 0.768 vs 0.669, P = 0.027).

Metallomics analysis of metal exposure and cognitive function in older adults: A combined epidemiological and bioinformatics study.,"Dementia is a significant cause of elderly disability and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. As an early stage of AD, the mechanism related to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and heavy metals is still unclear. This study utilized a cross-sectional design and enrolled 514 older adults in Bejing, China. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and fourteen blood metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In the adjusted single-metal models, we observed that copper [Cu, β (95% CI): 3.73 (-6.42, -1.03)] and lead [Pb, β (95% CI): 0.79 (-1.26, -0.32)] demonstrated negative associations with cognitive function, while selenium [Se, β (95% CI): 2.97 (1.23, 4.70)] was beneficial to cognition. Our findings were robust in secondary analysis using multi-metal models, which included generalized linear models (GLM), Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and quantile g-computation (qgcomp). Moreover, the toxic metal mixture (Cu and Pb) exhibited a significant negative association with MMSE scores and the inclusion of Se in the metal mixture attenuated the neurotoxicity of Cu-Pb mixture. The in silico analysis was used to examine the potential molecular mechanisms (genes, biological processes, pathways, and illnesses) of interaction among metal mixtures. We identified 20 cognition-related genes that are associated with both Cu-Pb and Se. Among these genes, eight (APOE, APP, BAX, BDNF, CASP3, HMOX1, TF, and TPP1) exhibited opposite effects on protein activity, mRNA expression, or protein expression in response to Se and Cu/Pb exposure, which could be the key genes accounting for the anti-neurotoxic effects of Se. Our findings support that Se can attenuate the neurotoxicity of exposure to single Cu or Pb, and Cu-Pb mixture. More research is needed to confirm our findings and gain knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of combined metal exposure on cognitive function.",2023,Cognitive function; Copper; Lead; Metal mixture; Molecular mechanisms; Selenium,Aged; Humans; Copper; Bayes Theorem; Cross-Sectional Studies; Lead; Cognition; Computational Biology; Dementia,"Li, K; Wu, J; Mei, Y; Zhao, J; Zhou, Q; Li, Y; Yang, M; Xu, J; Zhao, M; Xu, Q"

Cost-effective Alzheimer's disease detection using plasma p-tau217-based risk stratification.,No abstract,2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Risk Assessment,
A two-step workflow based on plasma p-tau217 to screen for amyloid β positivity with further confirmatory testing only in uncertain cases.,"Cost-effective strategies for identifying amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity in patients with cognitive impairment are urgently needed with recent approvals of anti-Aβ immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood biomarkers can accurately detect AD pathology, but it is unclear whether their incorporation into a full diagnostic workflow can reduce the number of confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) tests needed while accurately classifying patients. We evaluated a two-step workflow for determining Aβ-PET status in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from two independent memory clinic-based cohorts (n = 348). A blood-based model including plasma tau protein 217 (p-tau217), age and APOE ε4 status was developed in BioFINDER-1 (area under the curve (AUC) = 89.3%) and validated in BioFINDER-2 (AUC = 94.3%). In step 1, the blood-based model was used to stratify the patients into low, intermediate or high risk of Aβ-PET positivity. In step 2, we assumed referral only of intermediate-risk patients to CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 testing, whereas step 1 alone determined Aβ-status for low- and high-risk groups. Depending on whether lenient, moderate or stringent thresholds were used in step 1, the two-step workflow overall accuracy for detecting Aβ-PET status was 88.2%, 90.5% and 92.0%, respectively, while reducing the number of necessary CSF tests by 85.9%, 72.7% and 61.2%, respectively. In secondary analyses, an adapted version of the BioFINDER-1 model led to successful validation of the two-step workflow with a different plasma p-tau217 immunoassay in patients with cognitive impairment from the TRIAD cohort (n = 84). In conclusion, using a plasma p-tau217-based model for risk stratification of patients with MCI can substantially reduce the need for confirmatory testing while accurately classifying patients, offering a cost-effective strategy to detect AD in memory clinic settings.",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Workflow; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Blood Proteins; Alzheimer Disease","Brum, WS; Cullen, NC; Janelidze, S; Ashton, NJ; Zimmer, ER; Therriault, J; Benedet, AL; Rahmouni, N; Tissot, C; Stevenson, J; Servaes, S; Triana-Baltzer, G; Kolb, HC; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Rosa-Neto, P; Blennow, K; Hansson, O"

A possible mechanism for the enhanced toxicity of beta-amyloid protofibrils in Alzheimer's disease.,"The amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) is a driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ monomers can aggregate and form larger soluble (oligomers/protofibrils) and insoluble (fibrils) forms. There is evidence that Aβ protofibrils are the most toxic form, but the reasons are not known. Consistent with a critical role for this form of Aβ in AD, a recently FDA-approved therapeutic antibody targeted against protofibrils, lecanemab, slows the progression of AD in patients. The plasma contact system, which can promote coagulation and inflammation, has been implicated in AD pathogenesis. This system is activated by Aβ which could lead to vascular and inflammatory pathologies associated with AD. We show here that the contact system is preferentially activated by protofibrils of Aβ. Aβ protofibrils bind to coagulation factor XII and high molecular weight kininogen and accelerate the activation of the system. Furthermore, lecanemab blocks Aβ protofibril activation of the contact system. This work provides a possible mechanism for Aβ protofibril toxicity in AD and why lecanemab is therapeutically effective.",2023,Alzheimer’s; beta-amyloid; coagulation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Blood Coagulation; Cytoskeleton; Factor XII,"Chen, ZL; Singh, PK; Calvano, M; Norris, EH; Strickland, S"

Perioperative brain injury marker concentrations in neonatal open-heart surgery: a prospective observational study.,"Neonates with critical congenital heart defects undergoing open-heart surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass circulation are at risk for white matter brain injury. This article reports on pre- and postoperative plasma concentrations of brain injury markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL) and Tau, and their respective associations with white matter lesions detected on postoperatively performed brain MRI. Forty term newborns with isolated critical congenital heart defects were included in a prospective observational study. Brain injury marker plasma concentrations were determined prior to surgery and at postoperative days 1, 2 and 3. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed pre- and postoperatively. Concentrations of brain injury markers were analysed using ultrasensitive single molecule array technology. Absolute pre- and postoperative plasma biomarker concentrations, and postoperative concentrations adjusted for preoperative concentrations were used for subsequent analysis. Plasma concentrations of GFAP, NfL and Tau displayed a well-defined temporal trajectory after neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass circulation. GFAP and Tau reached peak concentrations at postoperative day 2 (median concentrations 170.5 and 67.2 pg/ml, respectively), whereas NfL continued to increase throughout the study period (median concentration at postoperative day 3 191.5 pg/ml).

Association between aging-related biomarkers and longitudinal trajectories of intrinsic capacity in older adults.,"Intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of physical and mental capacities, declines with age at different rates and patterns between individuals. We aimed to investigate the association between longitudinal IC trajectories and plasma biomarkers of two hallmarks of aging-chronic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction-in older adults. From the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT), we included 1271 community-dwelling older people (mean [SD] age = 76.0 [4.3] years) with IC data over four years. Group-based multi-trajectory modeling was performed to identify clusters of the participants with similar longitudinal patterns across four IC domains: cognition, locomotion, psychology, and vitality. Five IC multi-trajectory groups were determined: low in all domains (8.4%), low locomotion (24.6%), low psychological domain (16.7%), robust (i.e., high in all domains except vitality; 28.3%), and robust with high vitality (22.0%). Compared to the best trajectory group (i.e., robust with high vitality), elevated levels of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1), and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) were associated with a higher risk of belonging to the ""low in all domains"" group (IL-6: relative risk ratio (RRR) [95% CI] = 1.42 [1.07 - 1.88]; TNFR-1: RRR = 1.46 [1.09 - 1.96]; GDF-15: RRR = 1.99 [1.45 - 2.73]). Higher IL-6 and GDF-15 also increased the risk of being in the ""low locomotion"" group. GDF-15 outperformed other biomarkers by showing the strongest associations with IC trajectory groups.

Lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in patients with Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"Lipid metabolism and oxidative stress are key mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The link between plasma lipid metabolites and oxidative stress in AD patients is poorly understood. This study was to identify markers that distinguish AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from NC, and to reveal potential links between lipid metabolites and oxidative stress. We performed non-targeted lipid metabolism analysis of plasma from patients with AD, aMCI, and NC using LC-MS/MS. The plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were assessed. We found significant differences in lipid metabolism between patients with AD and aMCI compared to those in NC. AD severity is associated with lipid metabolites, especially TG (18:0_16:0_18:0) + NH4, TG (18:0_16:0_16:0) + NH4, LPC(16:1e)-CH3, and PE (20:0_20:4)-H. SPH (d16:0) + H, SPH (d18:1) + H, and SPH (d18:0) + H were high-performance markers to distinguish AD and aMCI from NC. The AUC of three SPHs combined to predict AD was 0.990, with specificity and sensitivity as 0.949 and 1, respectively; the AUC of three SPHs combined to predict aMCI was 0.934, with specificity and sensitivity as 0.900, 0.981, respectively. Plasma MDA concentrations were higher in the AD group than in the NC group (p = 0.003), whereas plasma SOD levels were lower in the AD (p < 0.001) and aMCI (p = 0.045) groups than in NC, and GSH-Px activity were higher in the AD group than in the aMCI group (p = 0.007). In addition, lipid metabolites and oxidative stress are widely associated. In conclusion, this study distinguished serum lipid metabolism in AD, aMCI, and NC subjects, highlighting that the three SPHs can distinguish AD and aMCI from NC. Additionally, AD patients showed elevated oxidative stress, and there are complex interactions between lipid metabolites and oxidative stress.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; biomarkers; lipid metabolism; oxidative stress,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Lipid Metabolism; Chromatography, Liquid; Neuropsychological Tests; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Cognitive Dysfunction; Oxidative Stress; Lipids; Superoxide Dismutase","Nie, Y; Chu, C; Qin, Q; Shen, H; Wen, L; Tang, Y; Qu, M"

Integration of plasma and CSF metabolomics with CSF proteomic reveals novel associations between lipid mediators and central nervous system vascular and energy metabolism.,"Integration of the omics data, including metabolomics and proteomics, provides a unique opportunity to search for new associations within metabolic disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Using metabolomics, we have previously profiled oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids, and steroids in 293 CSF and 202 matched plasma samples from AD cases and healthy controls and identified both central and peripheral markers of AD pathology within inflammation-regulating cytochrome p450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway. Additionally, using proteomics, we have identified five cerebrospinal fluid protein panels, involved in the regulation of energy metabolism, vasculature, myelin/oligodendrocyte, glia/inflammation, and synapses/neurons, affected in AD, and reflective of AD-related changes in the brain. In the current manuscript, using metabolomics-proteomics data integration, we describe new associations between peripheral and central lipid mediators, with the above-described CSF protein panels. Particularly strong associations were observed between cytochrome p450/soluble epoxide hydrolase metabolites, bile acids, and proteins involved in glycolysis, blood coagulation, and vascular inflammation and the regulators of extracellular matrix. Those metabolic associations were not observed at the gene-co-expression level in the central nervous system.

Spinal cord and brain concentrations of riluzole after oral and intrathecal administration: A potential new treatment route for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Riluzole is the only treatment known to improve survival in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, oral riluzole efficacy is modest at best, further it is known to have large inter-individual variability of serum concentration and clearance, is formulated as an oral drug in a patient population plagued with dysphagia, and has known systemic side-effects like asthenia (limiting patient compliance) and elevated liver enzymes. In this context, we postulated that continuous intrathecal (IT) infusion of low doses of riluzole could provide consistent elevations of the drug spinal cord (SC) concentrations at or above those achieved with oral dosing, without increasing the risk for adverse events associated with systemic drug exposure or off-target side effects in the brain. We developed a formulation of riluzole for IT delivery and conducted our studies in purpose-bred hound dogs. Our non-GLP studies revealed that IT infusion alone was able to increase SC concentrations above those provided by oral administration, without increasing plasma concentrations. We then conducted two GLP studies that combined IT infusion with oral administration at human equivalent dose, to evaluate SC and brain concentrations of riluzole along with assessments of safety and tolerability. In the 6-week study, the highest IT dose (0.2 mg/hr) was well tolerated by the animals and increased SC concentrations above those achieved with oral riluzole alone, without increasing brain concentrations. In the 6-month study, the highest dose tested (0.4 mg/hr) was not tolerated and yielded SC significantly above those achieved in all previous studies. Our data show the feasibility and safety profile of continuous IT riluzole delivery to the spinal cord, without concurrent elevated liver enzymes, and minimal brain concentrations creating another potential therapeutic route of delivery to be used in isolation or in combination with other therapeutics.""",2023,,"Humans; Animals; Dogs; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Riluzole; Brain; Administration, Oral; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions","Keifer, OP; Gutierrez, J; Butt, MT; Cramer, SD; Bartus, R; Tansey, M; Deaver, D; Betourne, A; Boulis, NM"

We aimed to simultaneously investigate the association of circulating levels of selected gut microbiome molecules and inflammatory markers with dementia risk. This case-cohort epidemiological study included 805 individuals (83 years, 66% women) free of dementia at baseline. Plasma levels of 19 selected gut microbiome molecules comprising lipopolysaccharide, short-chain fatty acids, and indole-containing tryptophan metabolites as well as four inflammatory markers measured at baseline were linked to incident all-cause (ACD) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) in binary outcomes and time-to-dementia analyses. Independent of several covariates, seven gut microbiome molecules, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-butyric acid, indole-3-acryloylglycine, indole-3-lactic acid, indole-3-acetic acid methyl ester, isobutyric acid, and 2-methylbutyric acid, but no inflammatory markers discriminated incident dementia cases from non-cases. Furthermore, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (hazard ratio: 0.58; 0.36-0.94, P = 0.025) was associated with time-to-ACD. These molecules underpin gut microbiome-host interactions in the development of dementia and they may be crucial in its prevention and intervention strategies. Future larger epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our findings, specifically in exploring the repeatedly measured circulating levels of these molecules and investigating their causal relationship with dementia risk.",2023,Dementia; Gut microbiome molecules; Indole-containing tryptophan metabolites; Lipopolysaccharide; Short-chain fatty acids; Systemic inflammatory markers,,"Oluwagbemigun, K; Anesi, A; Vrhovsek, U; Mattivi, F; Martino Adami, P; Pentzek, M; Scherer, M; Riedel-Heller, SG; Weyerer, S; Bickel, H; Wiese, B; Schmid, M; Cryan, JF; Ramirez, A; Wagner, M; Nöthlings, U"
"Modifiable risk factors for dementia, cognition, and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 in a large-scale cohort of Australian older adults.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is preceded by years of silent pathological change. Our objective was to examine the associations between modifiable dementia risk factors, cognition, and plasma phosphorylated p-tau 181, a hallmark biomarker of AD in a large-scale community cohort. Participants (n = 738, mean age 65.41 years) from the Island Study Linking Ageing and Neurodegenerative Disease responded to online assessments collecting demographics, adherence to dementia risk factors and cognitive function, and provided a blood sample for analysis. We found less education was significantly associated with lower cognitive scores. Modifiable dementia risk factors were not associated with plasma p-tau 181. Further, we did not observe any significant relationships between plasma p-tau 181 and cognition. Nonmodifiable factors such as age, education, sex, and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 displayed significant associations with cognition and plasma p-tau 181. In a cognitively healthy community cohort of Tasmanian Australians, we did not observe any associations between modifiable risk factors for dementia and plasma p-tau 181. Nonmodifiable risk factors were associated with both cognition and plasma p-tau. This contributes to a growing body of evidence investigating confounding factors in the interpretation of blood-based biomarkers for dementia.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cognition; Dementia; Epidemiology; Modifiable risk; Public health,Humans; Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Australia; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Biomarkers; Risk Factors; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Roccati, E; Collins, JM; Bindoff, AD; Alty, JE; Bartlett, L; King, AE; Vickers, JC"
A Protease-Responsive Polymer/Peptide Conjugate and Reversible Assembly of Silver Clusters for the Detection of ,"We report the reversible aggregation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) assemblies using the combination of a cationic arginine-based peptide and sulfur-capped polyethylene glycol (PEG). The formation and dissociation of the aggregates were studied by optical methods and electron microscopy. The dissociation of silver clusters depends on the peptide sequence and PEG size. A molecular weight of 1 kDa for PEG was optimal for the dissociation. The most important feature of this dissociation method is that it can operate in complex biofluids such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell media, or even seawater without a significant decrease in performance. Moreover, the peptide-particle assemblies are highly stable and do not degrade (or express of loss of signal upon dissociation) when dried and resolubilized, frozen and thawed, or left in daylight for a month. Importantly, the dissociation capacity of PEG can be reduced via the conjugation of a peptide-cleavable substrate. The dissociation capacity is restored in the presence of an enzyme. Based on these findings, we designed a PEG-peptide hybrid molecule specific to the ",2023,P. gingivalis; PEG; peptides; periodontitis; protease sensing; reversible assembly; silver nanoparticles,Peptide Hydrolases; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Silver; Polymers; Metal Nanoparticles; Endopeptidases; Peptides; Polyethylene Glycols,"Retout, M; Amer, L; Yim, W; Creyer, MN; Lam, B; Trujillo, DF; Potempa, J; O'Donoghue, AJ; Chen, C; Jokerst, JV"
Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma: Clinical Presentation and Therapeutic Options.,"Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PES) is one of the most common causes of open-angle glaucoma, with a higher risk of vision loss, a higher maximum and mean intraocular pressure (IOP) at diagnosis, and a wider range of IOP fluctuation compared to primary open-angle glaucoma. Patients with this syndrome have a ten-fold higher risk of developing glaucoma than the normal population. A definite diagnosis can be made by the observation of pseudoexfoliation material (PEM) on the anterior lens surface, ciliary processes, zonules, and iris. PEM deposits on the zonules may explain the clinically observed zonular weakness and lens subluxation or dislocation. An increased incidence of cataract development is also associated with PES. There is growing evidence for systemic associations of PES with peripheral, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular system diseases, Alzheimer's disease, hearing loss, and increased plasma homocysteine levels. Indications for surgery are markedly more common in patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma than primary open-angle glaucoma. The goal of this article is to review the latest perspectives on the clinical features, therapy, and systemic associations of this clinically and biologically challenging disease.",2023,Pseudoexfoliation; pseudoexfoliation glaucoma; pseudoexfoliation syndrome,"Humans; Cataract; Exfoliation Syndrome; Glaucoma; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Lens Subluxation","Yüksel, N; Yılmaz Tuğan, B"

Exercise therapy to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in the elderly with dementia, memory loss, and severe cognitive impairment that imposes high medical costs on individuals. The causes of AD include increased deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau, age, mitochondrial defects, increased neuroinflammation, decreased synaptic connections, and decreased nerve growth factors (NGF). While in animals moderate-intensity exercise restores hippocampal and amygdala memory through increased levels of p-AKT, p-TrkB, and p-PKC and decreased levels of Aβ, tau phosphorylation, and amyloid precursor proteins (APP) in AD. Aerobic exercise (with an intensity of 50-75% of VO2 max) prevents hippocampal volume reduction, spatial memory reduction, and learning reduction through increasing synaptic flexibility. Exercise training induces the binding of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to TrkB and the binding of NGF to TrkA to induce cell survival and neuronal plasticity. After aerobic training and high-intensity interval training, the increase of VEGF, angiopoietin 1 and 2, NO, tPA, and HCAR1 in cerebral vessels causes increased blood flow and angiogenesis in the cerebellum, motor cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. In the hippocampus, exercise training decreases mitochondrial fragmentation, DRP1, and FIS1, improving OPA1, MFN1, MFN2, and mitochondrial morphology. In humans, acute exercise as an anti-inflammatory condition causes an acute increase in IL-6 and an increase in anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-1RA and IL-10. Moderate-intensity exercise also inhibits inflammatory markers such as IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, TNF-α, sTNFR1, COX-2, and NF-κB. Aerobic exercise significantly increases plasma levels of BDNF, nerve growth factor, synaptic plasticity, motor activity, spatial memory, and exploratory behavior in AD subjects. Irisin is a myokine released from skeletal muscle during exercise and protects the hippocampus by suppressing Aβ accumulation and promoting hippocampal proliferation through STAT3 signaling. Therefore, combined exercise training such as aerobic training, strength training, balance and coordination training, and cognitive and social activities seems to provide important benefits for people with AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; aerobic training; anaerobic training; exercise; strength training,,"Pahlavani, HA"
Electrochemical magneto-immunoassay for detection of ADAM10 Alzheimer's biomarker using gold nanoparticles as label.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative and progressive illness with no known cure, is the most frequent cause of dementia in older adults. Dementia in AD is usually preceded by a stage of cognitive decline known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI has gained attention as an ideal target for prevention and early interventions, considering its reversible characteristic. Here, we propose a magneto-immunoassay based on a low-cost screen-printed electrode for detecting soluble ADAM10 in plasma samples, a potential biomarker for early AD diagnosis. We present a sandwich immunoassay using magnetic beads modified with antibodies to capture ADAM10 from plasma samples and using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as an electrochemical label. The assay was designed to accurately detect ADAM10 in diluted plasma with a limit of detection (LoD) of 32.5 pg/mL and a dynamic linear range of 10.0-1000.0 pg/mL. Twenty-three plasma samples from the elderly, including patients with AD, MCI, and healthy subjects (negative control), were analyzed by the magneto-immunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the ADAM10 levels correlated. This work shows the potential of this protein as a biomarker in the early diagnosis and progression of AD and provides an interesting disposable device with capabilities for applications as point-of-care (PoC) to measure ADAM10 levels.",2024,ADAM10; Alzheimer's disease; Biomarkers; Early diagnosis; Magneto-immunoassay; Magneto-immunosensor,Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Immunoassay; Biomarkers; ADAM10 Protein; Membrane Proteins; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases,"de Oliveira, TR; Manzine, PR; Cominetti, MR; Leite, OD; Faria, RC"
Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers are associated with cognitive function and dementia: Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.,"Inflammatory protein biomarkers induced by immune responses have been associated with cognitive decline and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate associations between a panel of inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive function and incident dementia outcomes in the well-characterized Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. Participants aged ≥40 years and dementia-free at Exam 7 who had a stored plasma sample were selected for profiling using the OLINK proteomics inflammation panel. Cross-sectional associations of the biomarkers with cognitive domain scores (N = 708, 53% female, 22% apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers, 15% APOE ε2 carriers, mean age 61) and incident all-cause and AD dementia during up to 20 years of follow-up were tested. APOE genotype-stratified analyses were performed to explore effect modification. Higher levels of 12 and 3 proteins were associated with worse executive function and language domain factor scores, respectively. Several proteins were associated with more than one cognitive domain, including IL10, LIF-R, TWEAK, CCL19, IL-17C, MCP-4, and TGF-alpha. Stratified analyses suggested differential effects between APOE ε2 and ε4 carriers: most ε4 carrier associations were with executive function and memory domains, whereas most ε2 associations were with the visuospatial domain. Higher levels of TNFB and CDCP1 were associated with higher risks of incident all-cause and AD dementia. Our study found that TWEAK concentration was associated both with cognitive function and risks for AD dementia. The association of these inflammatory biomarkers with cognitive function and incident dementia may contribute to the discovery of therapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; cognitive aging; peripheral inflammation; protein biomarkers,"Humans; Female; Male; Apolipoprotein E2; Cross-Sectional Studies; Genotype; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Apolipoproteins E; Cognitive Dysfunction; Apolipoprotein E4; Longitudinal Studies; Biomarkers; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cell Adhesion Molecules","Chen, J; Doyle, MF; Fang, Y; Mez, J; Crane, PK; Scollard, P; Satizabal, CL; Alosco, ML; Qiu, WQ; Murabito, JM; Lunetta, KL"

Zein-Based Nanoparticles Improve the Therapeutic Efficacy of a TrkB Agonist toward Alzheimer's Disease.,"The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB pathway plays a crucial role in neural plasticity and neuronal survival but is often deficient in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). CF3CN acts as a specific TrkB agonist that displays therapeutic effects in the AD mouse model, but its brain/plasma ratio (B/P ratio) distribution is not satisfactory. To increase its brain exposure, we synthesized several derivatives and employed nanoparticle (NP) formulation to optimize the most potent #2 derivative's in vivo PK profiles. We generated stable #2-loaded zein/lactoferrin composite NPs (#2/zein/LF) using the antisolvent co-precipitation method. In vivo PK studies revealed that nanoencapsulation improved #2's oral bioavailability by approximately 2-fold and significantly enhanced its plasma ",2023,AEP; Alzheimer’s disease; TrkB; bioavailability; nanoparticles; zein,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Zein; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Brain; Nanoparticles; Disease Models, Animal; Receptor, trkB","Wang, G; Han, J; Meng, X; Kang, SS; Liu, X; Sun, YE; Luo, Q; Ye, K"

APPI-Derived Cyclic Peptide Enhances Aβ42 Aggregation and Reduces Aβ42-Mediated Membrane Destabilization and Cytotoxicity.,"An amyloid precursor protein inhibitor (APPI) and amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) are both subdomains of the human transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). In the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Aβ42 oligomerizes into aggregates of various sizes, with intermediate, low-molecular-weight Aβ42 oligomers currently being held to be the species responsible for the most neurotoxic effects associated with the disease. Strategies to ameliorate the toxicity of these intermediate Aβ42 oligomeric species include the use of short, Aβ42-interacting peptides that either inhibit the formation of the Aβ42 oligomeric species or promote their conversion to high-molecular-weight aggregates. We therefore designed such an Aβ42-interacting peptide that is based on the β-hairpin amino acid sequence of the APPI, which exhibits high similarity to the β-sheet-like aggregation site of Aβ42. Upon tight binding of this 20-mer cyclic peptide to Aβ42 (in a 1:1 molar ratio), the formation of Aβ42 aggregates was enhanced, and consequently, Aβ42-mediated cell toxicity was ameliorated. We showed that in the presence of the cyclic peptide, interactions of Aβ42 with both plasma and mitochondrial membranes and with phospholipid vesicles that mimic these membranes were inhibited. Specifically, the cyclic peptide inhibited Aβ42-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization and reduced Aβ42-mediated apoptosis and cell death. We suggest that the cyclic peptide modulates Aβ42 aggregation by enhancing the formation of large aggregates─as opposed to low-molecular-weight intermediates─and as such has the potential for further development as an AD therapeutic.",2023,APPI; Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ42; artificial membranes; neuronal cell toxicity; peptide−lipid interactions,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Peptides, Cyclic; Peptide Fragments; Alzheimer Disease","Lacham-Hartman, S; Moshe, R; Ben-Zichri, S; Shmidov, Y; Bitton, R; Jelinek, R; Papo, N"

Ameliorative and Neuroprotective Effect of Core-Shell Type Se@Au Conjugated Hesperidin Nanoparticles in Diabetes-Induced Cognitive Impairment.,"Diabetes mellitus is the most chronic metabolic ailment characterized by insulin deficiency leading to aberrant cognitive dysfunction in later stages. Hesperidin is a bioflavonoid, having different pharmacological activities, but its poor water solubility and short plasma half-life restrict its applications in the clinical field. So, the hesperidin was conjugated with gold, selenium, and core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles of gold and selenium. Different spectroscopic methods characterized the synthesized monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles. The rats were injected with streptozotocin to induce cognitive dysfunction, followed by administering HSP, HSP-Au NPs, HSP-Se NPs, and Se@Au-HSP NPs daily for 21 days. Then, the neurobehavioral studies, oxidative stress parameters, AChE and nitrite levels, the content of amyloid-β42, and inflammatory mediators were accessed to evaluate the effect of the nanoparticles against the STZ rat model. The results showed a significant increase in oxidative stress, AChE activity, amyloid-β42, nitrite levels, and neuroinflammation by upregulating the inflammatory cytokines in the streptozotocin-administered rat brain. The HSP, HSP-Au NPs, HSP-Se NPs, and Se@Au-HSP NPs effectively reversed all these effects of streptozotocin. However, the bimetallic nanoparticle Se@Au-HSP NPs revealed better neuroprotective action than HSP-Au NPs and HSP-Se NPs. Hesperidin-conjugated bimetallic nanoparticles improved learning and memory in the STZ rat model and may be an alternative approach for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Cognitive deficit; Core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles; Gold; Hesperidin; Neurodegeneration; Oxidative stress; Selenium,Animals; Rats; Hesperidin; Neuroprotective Agents; Nitrites; Selenium; Streptozocin; Diabetes Mellitus; Cognitive Dysfunction; Gold; Nanoparticles,"Behera, A; Pradhan, SP; Tejaswani, P; Sa, N; Pattnaik, S; Sahu, PK"
Evolution and Predictive Role of Plasma Alzheimer's Disease-related Pathological Biomarkers in Parkinson's Disease.,"Plasma Alzheimer's disease-related pathological biomarkers' role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. We aimed to determine whether plasma Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers can predict PD progression. A total of 184 PD patients and 86 healthy controls were included and followed up for 5 years. Plasma phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), Aβ40, and Aβ42 were measured at baseline and the 1- and 2-year follow-ups using the Quanterix-single-molecule array. Global cognitive function and motor symptoms were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III. Genetic analyses were conducted to identify APOE and MAPT genotypes. Plasma p-tau181 levels were higher in PD than healthy controls. APOE-ε4 carriers had lower plasma Aβ42 levels and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The linear mixed-effects models showed that Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were associated with plasma p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio (β -1.719 [-3.398 to -0.040], p = .045). Higher baseline plasma p-tau181 correlated with faster cognitive decline and motor symptoms deterioration in total patients (β -0.170 [-0.322 to -0.018], p = .029; β 0.329 [0.032 to 0.626], p = .030) and APOE-ε4 carriers (β -0.318 [-0.602 to -0.034], p = .030; β 0.632 [0.017 to 1.246], p = .046), but not in the noncarriers. Higher baseline plasma Aβ40 correlated with faster cognitive decline in total patients (β -0.007 [-0.015 to -0.0001], p = .047) and faster motor symptoms deterioration in total patients (β 0.026 [0.010 to 0.041], p = .001) and APOE-ε4 carriers (β 0.044 [-0.026 to 0.049], p = .020), but not in the noncarriers.

Integrated brain and plasma dual-channel metabolomics to explore the treatment effects of Alpinia oxyphyllaFructus on Alzheimer's disease.,"Alpinia oxyphylla Fructus, called Yizhi in Chinese, is the dried fruit of Alpinia oxyphylla Miquel. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat dementia and memory defects of Alzheimer's disease for many years. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we used a rat Alzheimer's disease model on intrahippocampal injection of aggregated Aβ1-42 to study the effects of Alpinia oxyphylla Fructus. A brain and plasma dual-channel metabolomics approach combined with multivariate statistical analysis was further performed to determine the effects of Alpinia oxyphylla Fructus on Alzheimer's disease animals. As a result, in the Morris water maze test, Alpinia oxyphylla Fructus had a clear ability to ameliorate the impaired learning and memory of Alzheimer's disease rats. 11 differential biomarkers were detected in AD rats' brains. The compounds mainly included amino acids and phospholipids; after Alpinia oxyphylla Fructus administration, 9 regulated biomarkers were detected compared with the AD model group. In the plasma of AD rats, 29 differential biomarkers, primarily amino acids, phospholipids and fatty acids, were identified; After administration, 23 regulated biomarkers were detected. The metabolic pathways of regulated metabolites suggest that Alpinia oxyphylla Fructus ameliorates memory and learning deficits in AD rats principally by regulating amino acid metabolism, lipids metabolism, and energy metabolism. In conclusion, our results confirm and enhance our current understanding of the therapeutic effects of Alpinia oxyphylla Fructus on Alzheimer's disease.

Association of spermidine blood levels with microstructure of sleep-implications from a population-based study.,"Deteriorations in slow wave sleep (SWS) have been linked to brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), possibly due to its key role in clearance of amyloid-beta and tau (Aß/tau), two pathogenic hallmarks of AD. Spermidine administration has been shown to improve sleep quality in animal models. So far, the association between spermidine levels in humans and parameters of SWS physiology are unknown but may be valuable for therapeutic strategies. Data from 216 participants (age range 50-81 years) of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania TREND were included in our analysis. We investigated associations between spermidine plasma levels, key parameters of sleep macroarchitecture and microarchitecture that were previously associated with AD pathology, and brain health measured via a marker of structural brain atrophy (AD score). Higher spermidine levels were significantly associated with lower coupling between slow oscillations and spindle activity. No association was evident for SWS, slow oscillatory, and spindle activity throughout non-rapid eye movement sleep. Furthermore, elevated spermidine blood levels were significantly associated with a higher AD score, while sleep markers revealed no association with AD score.

The potential of blood neurofilament light as a marker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease.,"Over the past several years, there has been a surge in blood biomarker studies examining the value of plasma or serum neurofilament light (NfL) as a biomarker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease. However, there have been limited efforts to combine existing findings to assess the utility of blood NfL as a biomarker of neurodegeneration for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we still need better insight into the specific aspects of neurodegeneration that are reflected by the elevated plasma or serum concentration of NfL. In this review, we survey the literature on the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between blood-based NfL levels and other, neuroimaging-based, indices of neurodegeneration in individuals on the Alzheimer's continuum. Then, based on the biomarker classification established by the FDA-NIH Biomarker Working group, we determine the utility of blood-based NfL as a marker for monitoring the disease status (i.e. monitoring biomarker) and predicting the severity of neurodegeneration in older adults with and without cognitive decline (i.e. a prognostic or a risk/susceptibility biomarker). The current findings suggest that blood NfL exhibits great promise as a monitoring biomarker because an increased NfL level in plasma or serum appears to reflect the current severity of atrophy, hypometabolism and the decline of white matter integrity, particularly in the brain regions typically affected by Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal evidence indicates that blood NfL can be useful not only as a prognostic biomarker for predicting the progression of neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease but also as a susceptibility/risk biomarker predicting the likelihood of abnormal alterations in brain structure and function in cognitively unimpaired individuals with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (e.g. those with a higher amyloid-β). There are still limitations to current research, as discussed in this review. Nevertheless, the extant literature strongly suggests that blood NfL can serve as a valuable prognostic and susceptibility biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration in clinical settings, as well as in research settings.",2024,atrophy; dementia; glucose metabolism; white matter microstructure,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofilament Proteins; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intermediate Filaments; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Jung, Y; Damoiseaux, JS"
[How Helpful are Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for the Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease?].,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies on imaging and fluid biomarkers to objectively detect and quantitatively evaluate brain AD pathologies. Amyloid- and tau-PET scans recently enabled clinicians to make definitive diagnoses based on abnormal amyloid/tau deposition in the human brain. Since PET scans and blood-based biomarkers are mutually complementary, the identification of suitable blood-based biomarkers is essential for screening brain AD pathologies. According to the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) Research Framework published in 2018, AD is defined by its underlying pathologic processes, which can be diagnosed in vivo using suitable biomarkers. These biomarkers are categorized under the ATN classification system, including β amyloid deposition (A), pathologic tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N). Originally, all the ATN fluid biomarkers were assessed using cerebrospinal fluid, but currently these biomarkers can be quantified using blood samples. Among those blood-based ATN biomarkers, the plasma levels of Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) representing ""A,"" ""T,"" and ""N"" biomarkers, respectively, are useful in the early diagnosis of AD. However, further studies and additional data are required before utilizing these blood-based biomarkers as stand-alone diagnostic markers for AD.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Early Diagnosis; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Tokuda, T"
Plasma neurofilament light chain in relation to 10-year change in cognition and neuroimaging markers: a population-based study.,"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising biomarker for risk stratification and disease monitoring of dementia, but its utility in the preclinical disease stage remains uncertain. We determined the association of plasma NfL with (change in) neuroimaging markers and cognition in the population-based Rotterdam Study, using linear and logistic regression and mixed-effects models. Plasma NfL levels were measured using the Simoa NF-light™ assay in 4705 dementia-free participants (mean age 71.9 years, 57% women), who underwent cognitive assessment and brain MRI with repeated assessments over a 10-year follow-up period. Higher plasma NfL was associated with worse cognitive performance at baseline (g-factor: β =  - 0.12 (- 0.15; - 0.09), p < 0.001), and accelerated cognitive decline during follow-up on the Stroop color naming task (β = 0.04 (0.02; 0.06), p < 0.001), with a smaller trend for decline in global cognition (g-factor β =  - 0.02 (- 0.04; 0.00), p = 0.044). In the subset of 975 participants with brain MRI, higher NfL was associated with poorer baseline white matter integrity (e.g., global mean diffusivity: β = 0.12 (0.06; 0.19), p < 0.001), with similar trends for volume of white matter hyperintensities (β = 0.09 (0.02; 0.16), p = 0.011) and presence of lacunes (OR = 1.55 (1.13; 2.14), p = 0.007). Plasma NfL was not associated with volumes or thickness of the total gray matter, hippocampus, or Alzheimer signature regions. In conclusion, higher plasma NfL levels are associated with cognitive decline and larger burden of primarily white matter pathology in the general population.",2024,Cognition; Neurofilament light chain; Neuroimaging; Population-based,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Intermediate Filaments; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuroimaging,"van Arendonk, J; Wolters, FJ; Neitzel, J; Vinke, EJ; Vernooij, MW; Ghanbari, M; Ikram, MA"

CETP inhibitor evacetrapib enters mouse brain tissue.,"High levels of plasma cholesterol, especially high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), have been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in plasma distributes cholesteryl esters between lipoproteins and increases LDL-C in plasma. Epidemiologically, decreased CETP activity has been associated with sustained cognitive performance during aging, longevity, and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, pharmacological CETP inhibitors could be repurposed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease as they are safe and effective at lowering CETP activity and LDL-C. Although CETP is mostly expressed by the liver and secreted into the bloodstream, it is also expressed by astrocytes in the brain. Therefore, it is important to determine whether CETP inhibitors can enter the brain. Here, we describe the pharmacokinetic parameters of the CETP inhibitor evacetrapib in the plasma, liver, and brain tissues of CETP transgenic mice. We show that evacetrapib crosses the blood-brain barrier and is detectable in brain tissue 0.5 h after a 40 mg/kg i.v. injection in a non-linear function. We conclude that evacetrapib may prove to be a good candidate to treat CETP-mediated cholesterol dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; PBPK model; brain; cholesterol; cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP); evacetrapib; inhibitor; pharmacokinetic,,"Phénix, J; Côté, J; Dieme, D; Recinto, SJ; Oestereich, F; Efrem, S; Haddad, S; Bouchard, M; Munter, LM"
"Associations of plasma NfL, GFAP, and t-tau with cerebral small vessel disease and incident dementia: longitudinal data of the AGES-Reykjavik Study.","We investigated the associations of plasma neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and total tau (t-tau) with markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and with incident dementia. We also investigated whether associations of NfL, GFAP, and t-tau with incident dementia were explained by SVD. Data are from a random subsample (n = 1069) of the population-based AGES-Reykjavik Study who underwent brain MRI and in whom plasma NfL, GFAP, and t-tau were measured at baseline (76.1 ± 5.4 years/55.9% women/baseline 2002-2006/follow-up until 2015). A composite SVD burden score was calculated using white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), subcortical infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and large perivascular spaces. Dementia was assessed in a 3-step process and adjudicated by specialists. Higher NfL was associated with a higher SVD burden score. Dementia occurred in 225 (21.0%) individuals. The SVD burden score significantly explained part of the association between NfL and incident dementia. WMHV mostly strongly contributed to the explained effect. GFAP was not associated with the SVD burden score, but was associated with WMHV, and WMHV significantly explained part of the association between GFAP and incident dementia. T-tau was associated with WMHV, but not with incident dementia. In conclusion, the marker most strongly related to SVD is plasma NfL, for which the association with WMHV appeared to explain part of its association with incident dementia. This study suggests that plasma NfL may reflect the contribution of co-morbid vascular disease to dementia. However, the magnitude of the explained effect was relatively small, and further research is required to investigate the clinical implications of this finding.",2024,Cerebral small vessel disease; Dementia; Epidemiology; Plasma GFAP; Plasma NfL; Plasma t-tau,Female; Humans; Male; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Dementia; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Intermediate Filaments; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; tau Proteins,"van Gennip, ACE; Satizabal, CL; Tracy, RP; Sigurdsson, S; Gudnason, V; Launer, LJ; van Sloten, TT"

"Simultaneous Intranasal Codelivery of Donepezil and Memantine in a Nanocolloidal Carrier: Optimization, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics Studies.","This work focuses on developing nanoemulsions using a low-energy emulsification method for the codelivery of donepezil and memantine in one dosage form intended to be administered via the intranasal route for enhanced brain delivery. The nanoemulsion formulation was prepared using a low emulsification technique and characterized using various microscopy and nasal ciliotoxicity studies. The safe nanoemulsion was intended for preclinical pharmacokinetics with brain distribution and pharmacodynamics in a scopolamine-induced murine model. The formulated nanoemulsion was 16 nm in size, with a zeta potential of -7.22 mV, and exhibited a spherical shape. The brain concentration of IN-administered NE for DPZ and MEM was ∼678 and 249 ng/mL after 15 min. This concentration is more than 2 times higher in amount when compared with NE administered via PO, free drug solution administered via IN and PO route both. However, the plasma concentration of IN-administered NE for DPZ and MEM was ∼3 and 28 ng/mL after 15 min. In pharmacodynamic studies, the efficacy of NE administered via the IN route was higher when compared with other groups in neurobehavioral, biochemical estimation, and gene expression studies. The results suggest that the IN route can be explored in the future for the delivery of actives via nanocolloidal carriers in the brain for neurological disorders and can serve as promising alternatives for conventional dosage forms and routes.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; donepezil; memantine; nanoemulsion; pine oil; scopolamine,"Mice; Animals; Donepezil; Memantine; Administration, Intranasal; Brain; Scopolamine; Emulsions; Nanoparticles; Particle Size","Handa, M; Sanap, SN; Bhatta, RS; Patil, GP; Palkhade, R; Singh, DP; Shukla, R"

Structural basis for membrane-proximal proteolysis of substrates by ADAM10.,"The endopeptidase ADAM10 is a critical catalyst for the regulated proteolysis of key drivers of mammalian development, physiology, and non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP as the primary α-secretase. ADAM10 function requires the formation of a complex with a C8-tetraspanin protein, but how tetraspanin binding enables positioning of the enzyme active site for membrane-proximal cleavage remains unknown. We present here a cryo-EM structure of a vFab-ADAM10-Tspan15 complex, which shows that Tspan15 binding relieves ADAM10 autoinhibition and acts as a molecular measuring stick to position the enzyme active site about 20 Å from the plasma membrane for membrane-proximal substrate cleavage. Cell-based assays of N-cadherin shedding establish that the positioning of the active site by the interface between the ADAM10 catalytic domain and the bound tetraspanin influences selection of the preferred cleavage site. Together, these studies reveal the molecular mechanism underlying ADAM10 proteolysis at membrane-proximal sites and offer a roadmap for its modulation in disease.",2023,APP; Alzheimer’s disease; Notch signaling; alpha-secretase; ectodomain shedding; metalloprotease; tetraspanin,Animals; ADAM10 Protein; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Mammals; Proteolysis; Tetraspanins; Humans,"Lipper, CH; Egan, ED; Gabriel, KH; Blacklow, SC"

Twelve-lead ECGs were obtained at 3 time points within 1 hour prior to dosing to establish a baseline and then serially postdose. Concentration-QTc analysis of plasma concentrations of ANAVEX3-71 and metabolite M8 was conducted. ANAVEX3-71 at the studied doses did not have a clinically relevant effect on heart rate or on the PR and QRS intervals.

The Potential Therapeutic Application of Simvastatin for Brain Complications and Mechanisms of Action.,"Statins are common drugs that are clinically used to reduce elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Based on their solubility, statins are considered to be either hydrophilic or lipophilic. Amongst them, simvastatin has the highest lipophilicity to facilitate its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Recent studies have suggested that simvastatin could be a promising therapeutic option for different brain complications and diseases ranging from brain tumors (i.e., medulloblastoma and glioblastoma) to neurological disorders (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease). Specific mechanisms of disease amelioration, however, are still unclear. Independent studies suggest that simvastatin may reduce the risk of developing certain neurodegenerative disorders. Meanwhile, other studies point towards inducing cell death in brain tumor cell lines.

We aimed to characterize mtDNA methylation alterations in the plasma cfDNA of 31 AD patients and 26 age- and sex-matched cognitively normal control subjects. We found that the mtDNA methylation patterns differed between AD patients and control subjects. The mtDNA was predominantly hypomethylated in the plasma cfDNA of AD patients. The hypomethylation sites or regions were mainly located in mt-rRNA, mt-tRNA, and D-Loop regions. The hypomethylation of the D-Loop region in plasma cfDNA of AD patients was consistent with that in previous studies.

Yet, in the plasma P-tau231 literature, findings with regard to its diagnostic utility have been inconsistent, and thus, we aimed to statistically investigate the potential of plasma P-tau231 in the context of AD via meta-analysis. Publications on plasma P-tau231 were systematically retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and Web of Science databases. A total of 10 studies covering 2007 participants were included, and we conducted random-effect or fixed-effect meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis using the STATA SE 14.0 software. According to our quantitative integration, plasma P-tau231 increased from cognitively unimpaired (CU) populations to mild cognitive impairment to AD and showed significant changes in pairwise comparisons of AD, mild cognitive impairment and CU. Plasma P-tau231 level was significantly higher in CU controls with positive amyloid-β (Aβ) status compared with Aβ-negative CU group. Additionally, the excellent diagnostic accuracy of plasma P-tau231 for asymptomatic Aβ pathology was verified by the pooled value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (standard mean difference [95% confidence interval]: .75 [.69, .81], P < 0.00001). Overall, the increased plasma P-tau231 concentrations were found in relation to the early development and progression of AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; biomarker; dementia; meta-analysis; mild cognitive impairment; tau phosphorylation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Xu, C; Zhao, L; Dong, C"
Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: a multicenter-based cross-sectional and longitudinal study in China.,"Discrepancies in diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) may arise from racial disparities, risk factors, or lifestyle differences. Moreover, there has been a lack of systematic and multicenter studies to evaluate baselines of the AD biomarkers in Chinese populations. Thus, there is an urgent need for research to investigate the effectiveness of blood biomarkers for AD, specifically in the Chinese Han population, using a multicenter approach. In the present multicenter-based cross-sectional and longitudinal study, we evaluated 817 blood samples from 6 different clinical centers. We measured plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)-40, Aβ42, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau), total tau (tTau), serum neurofilament light (NFL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).

Changes in miR-134-3p expression and zDHHC3-AMPARs axis in association with aluminum neurotoxicity.,"Aluminum (Al) is a neurotoxic substance associated with cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanisms for aluminum neurotoxicity remain to be identified. In this work, we try to investigate a novel potential biomarker of cognitive dysfunction following aluminum exposure and the mechanism involved. Recently, miR-134-3p was reported as a novel regulator of cognitive function. To address this, we investigate the expression level of miR-134-3p in plasma from 280 aluminum factory workers and analyzed the correlation between miRNA-134-3p, blood Al concentration, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA scale) score. The results implied that occupational aluminum exposure elevated miR-134-3p expression in the plasma of workers accompanied by cognitive impairment. Our experiment studies using both animal models and PC12 cells validated the upregulation of miR-134-3p caused by aluminum. In addition, we identified that palmitoylation enzyme zDHHC3 was the target of miR-134-3p, and the decreasing AMPAR receptor (AMPAR) trafficking was related to the learning and memory impairment induced by aluminum. More importantly, using transfection and interference approaches in PC12 cells, inhibition of miR-134-3p resulted in a recovery of zDHHC3-AMPARs axis to a certain extent in response to aluminum. In summary, miR-134-3p was found to be involved in aluminum neurotoxicity by targeting zDHHC3-AMPARs axis and could serve as a potential biomarker or helpful target.",2023,AMPA receptor; Aluminum; Cognitive impairment; Neurotoxicity; microRNA-134-3p; zDHHC3,Rats; Animals; MicroRNAs; Aluminum; Up-Regulation; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Song, J; Li, W; Yuan, C; Gao, T; Lu, X; Wang, L; Niu, Q"

Pathological and therapeutic effects of extracellular vesicles in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.,"Extracellular vesicles are released by all cell types and contain proteins, microRNAs, mRNAs, and other bioactive molecules. Extracellular vesicles play an important role in intercellular communication and in the modulation of the immune system and neuroinflammation. The cargo of extracellular vesicles (e.g., proteins and microRNAs) is altered in pathological situations. Extracellular vesicles contribute to the pathogenesis of many pathologies associated with sustained inflammation and neuroinflammation, including cancer, diabetes, hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy, and other neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Extracellular vesicles may cross the blood-brain barrier and transfer pathological signals from the periphery to the brain. This contributes to inducing neuroinflammation and cognitive and motor impairment in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy and in neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanisms involved are beginning to be understood. For example, increased tumor necrosis factor α in extracellular vesicles from plasma of hyperammonemic rats induces neuroinflammation and motor impairment when injected into normal rats. Identifying the mechanisms by which extracellular vesicles contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases will help to develop new treatments and diagnostic tools for their easy and early detection. In contrast, extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells have therapeutic utility in many of the above pathologies, by reducing inflammation and neuroinflammation and improving cognitive and motor function. These extracellular vesicles recapitulate the beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells and have advantages as therapeutic tools: they are less immunogenic, may not differentiate to malignant cells, cross the blood-brain barrier, and may reach more easily target organs. Extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells have beneficial effects in models of ischemic brain injury, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, hyperammonemia, and hepatic encephalopathy. Extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells modulate the immune system, promoting the shift from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state. For example, extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells modulate the Th17/Treg balance, promoting the anti-inflammatory Treg. Extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells may also act directly in the brain to modulate microglia activation, promoting a shift from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state. This reduces neuroinflammation and improves cognitive and motor function. Two main components of extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells which contribute to these beneficial effects are transforming growth factor-β and miR-124. Identifying the mechanisms by which extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells induce the beneficial effects and the main molecules (e.g., proteins and mRNAs) involved may help to improve their therapeutic utility. The aims of this review are to summarize the knowledge of the pathological effects of extracellular vesicles in different pathologies, the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells to recover cognitive and motor function and the molecular mechanisms for these beneficial effects on neurological function.",2024,cognitive function; extracellular vesicles; inflammation; mesenchymal stem cells; neurodegenerative diseases; neuroinflammation; therapy; transforming growth factor-β,,"Izquierdo-Altarejos, P; Moreno-Manzano, V; Felipo, V"

Palmitoylation of solute carriers.,"Post-translational modifications are an important mechanism in the regulation of protein expression, function, and degradation. Well-known post-translational modifications are phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. However, lipid modifications, including myristoylation, prenylation, and palmitoylation, are poorly studied. Since the early 2000s, researchers have become more interested in lipid modifications, especially palmitoylation. The number of articles in PubMed increased from about 350 between 2000 and 2005 to more than 600 annually during the past ten years. S-palmitoylation, where the 16-carbon saturated (C16:0) palmitic acid is added to free cysteine residues of proteins, is a reversible protein modification that can affect the expression, membrane localization, and function of the modified proteins. Various diseases like Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease have been linked to changes in protein palmitoylation. In humans, the addition of palmitic acid is mediated by 23 palmitoyl acyltransferases, also called DHHC proteins. The modification can be reversed by a few thioesterases or hydrolases. Numerous soluble and membrane-attached proteins are known to be palmitoylated, but among the approximately 400 solute carriers that are classified in 66 families, only 15 found in 8 families have so far been documented to be palmitoylated. Among the best-characterized transporters are the glucose transporters GLUT1 (SLC2A1) and GLUT4 (SLC2A4), the three monoamine transporters norepinephrine transporter (NET; SLC6A2), dopamine transporter (DAT; SLC6A3), and serotonin transporter (SERT; SLC6A4), and the sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1 (SLC8A1). While there is evidence from recent proteomics experiments that numerous solute carriers are palmitoylated, no details beyond the 15 transporters covered in this review are available.",2023,Post-translational modification; S-palmitoylation; Solute carrier; Transport,"Humans; Palmitic Acid; Lipoylation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Phosphorylation; Membrane Proteins; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins","Villanueva, CE; Hagenbuch, B"
Selection of regioselective DNA aptamer for detection of homocysteine in nondeproteinized human plasma.,"Small molecule-binding aptamers often suffer from high cross reactivity to structure analogues in biological samples, limiting their value for clinical diagnosis. Herein, we present a method to overcome this issue, by performing binding-inhibited organic reaction-based regioselective selection of aptamers against homocysteine (Hcy), which is a marker for diagnosing many disorders including stroke and Alzheimer's. This approach has led to isolation of a DNA aptamer that binds to the alkane thiol chain of Hcy with exceptional specificity against cysteine. It also binds with oxidized Hcy at weaker affinity. Using this new aptamer, we produced a reusable fluorescent optical fiber aptasensor for direct and validated detection of both free and total Hcy in nondeproteinized patient plasma in the diagnostic concentration range. The binding site-specific aptamer selection and optical-fiber-sensing strategy can expand the practical utility of aptamers in clinical diagnosis.",2023,Aptamer; Aptasensor; Fiber-optic sensor; Free homocysteine; Molecular evolution; Total homocysteine,"Humans; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Limit of Detection; Biosensing Techniques; SELEX Aptamer Technique","Zhou, J; Li, H; Li, J; Liu, X; Zhao, J; Wang, N; Wang, Y; Zhang, Y; Zhang, X; Xin, Y; Li, X; Wang, Z; Shao, N; Lou, X"
Neuroprotective Effects of Nanowired Delivery of Cerebrolysin with Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Monoclonal Antibodies to Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase in Brain Pathology Following Alzheimer's Disease Exacerbated by Concussive Head Injury.,"Concussive head injury (CHI) is one of the major risk factors in developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in military personnel at later stages of life. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in CHI leads to extravasation of plasma amyloid beta protein (ΑβP) into the brain fluid compartments precipitating AD brain pathology. Oxidative stress in CHI or AD is likely to enhance production of nitric oxide indicating a role of its synthesizing enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in brain pathology. Thus, exploration of the novel roles of nanomedicine in AD or CHI reducing NOS upregulation for neuroprotection are emerging. Recent research shows that stem cells and neurotrophic factors play key roles in CHI-induced aggravation of AD brain pathologies. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that CHI exacerbates AD brain pathology in model experiments. Accordingly, it is quite likely that nanodelivery of NOS antibodies together with cerebrolysin and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will induce superior neuroprotection in AD associated with CHI.

To investigate the pharmacokinetics and acute toxicity of PT109B in rodents, we first developed and validated a UPLC-MS/MS analytical method to detect PT109B concentration in the biological matrix. The proposed method could separate and quantify the PT109B with good precision and accuracy. The pharmacokinetic results showed that the concentrations of PT109B in rat plasma increased with the dose, but not proportionally. Meanwhile, the double-peak phenomenon disappeared when decreasing the oral administration dosage. In addition, we found that PT109B could be detected in the central nervous system, and highly distributed in the liver and kidney. At the same time, the gender difference of PT109B in rats was observed, and the exposure of PT109B in female rats was significantly higher than that in male rats after oral administration. Finally, we found that oral administration of 750 mg/kg PT109B to C57 BL/6 mice caused significant liver injury in females, which was specifically manifested as hepatomegaly, increased liver coefficient, and hepatocyte ballooning. However, no significant damage was observed in other organs, which may be related to the distribution of PT109B in the liver.

PKCα Isoform Inhibits Insulin Signaling and Aggravates Neuronal Insulin Resistance.,"Overexpression of PKCα has been linked to inhibit insulin signaling disrupting IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylations in skeletal muscle. PKCα inhibits IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylations, but not required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscles. Inhibition of PKCα increased whereas in some studies decreased GLUT-4 levels at the plasma membrane in skeletal muscles and adipocytes. Controversial studies have reported opposite expression pattern of PKCα expression in insulin-resistant skeletal muscles. These findings indicate that the role of PKCα on insulin signaling is controversial and could be tissue specific. Evidently, studies are required to decipher the role of PKCα in regulating insulin signaling and preferably in other cellular systems. Utilizing neuronal cells, like Neuro-2a, SHSY-5Y and insulin-resistant diabetic mice brain tissues; we have demonstrated that PKCα inhibits insulin signaling, through IRS-Akt pathway in PP2A-dependent mechanism by an AS160-independent route involving 14-3-3ζ. Inhibition and silencing of PKCα improves insulin sensitivity by increasing GLUT-4 translocation to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake. PKCα regulates GSK3 isoforms in an opposite manner in insulin-sensitive and in insulin-resistant condition. Higher activity of PKCα aggravates insulin-resistant neuronal diabetic condition through GSK3β but not GSK3α. Our results mechanistically explored the contribution of PKCα in regulating neuronal insulin resistance and diabetes, which opens up new avenues in dealing with metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Insulin resistance; Insulin signaling; Neuron; PKCα,,"Mishra, D; Reddy, I; Dey, CS"

Proteomics analysis of plasma from middle-aged adults identifies protein markers of dementia risk in later life.,"A diverse set of biological processes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. However, there is limited understanding of the peripheral biological mechanisms relevant in the earliest phases of the disease. Here, we used a large-scale proteomics platform to examine the association of 4877 plasma proteins with 25-year dementia risk in 10,981 middle-aged adults. We found 32 dementia-associated plasma proteins that were involved in proteostasis, immunity, synaptic function, and extracellular matrix organization. We then replicated the association between 15 of these proteins and clinically relevant neurocognitive outcomes in two independent cohorts. We demonstrated that 12 of these 32 dementia-associated proteins were associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD, neurodegeneration, or neuroinflammation. We found that eight of these candidate protein markers were abnormally expressed in human postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD, although some of the proteins that were most strongly associated with dementia risk, such as GDF15, were not detected in these brain tissue samples. Using network analyses, we found a protein signature for dementia risk that was characterized by dysregulation of specific immune and proteostasis/autophagy pathways in adults in midlife ~20 years before dementia onset, as well as abnormal coagulation and complement signaling ~10 years before dementia onset. Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization genetically validated nine of our candidate proteins as markers of AD in midlife and inferred causality of SERPINA3 in AD pathogenesis.

"Therapeutic Potential of Myricetin in the Treatment of Neurological, Neuropsychiatric, and Neurodegenerative Disorders.","Myricetin (MC), 3,5,7,3',4',5'-hexahydroxyflavone, chemically belongs to a flavonoid category known to confer antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and neuroprotective effects. MC is known to suppress the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (MDA), and inflammatory markers. It has been reported to improve insulin function in the human brain and periphery. Besides this, it modulates several neurochemicals including glutamate, GABA, serotonin, etc. MC has been shown to reduce the expression of the enzyme Mono Amine Oxidase (MAO), which is responsible for the metabolism of monoamines. MC treatment reduces levels of plasma corticosterone and restores hippocampal BDNF (full form) protein in stressed animals. Further, MC has shown its protective effect against amyloid-beta, MPTP, rotenone, 6-OHDA, etc. suggesting its potential role against neurodegenerative disorders.

"Rapid screening of active ingredients and action mechanisms of Ecliptae Herba for treating Alzheimer's disease by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and ""component-target-pathway"" network.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. The drugs widely used in clinic are mainly single-target drugs for symptomatic treatment, which can only alleviate symptoms to a certain extent. Ecliptae Herba (EH) is considered a potential therapeutic drug for AD due to its neuroprotective effects. Although EH has a clear anti-AD effect, the material basis and mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, we adopted an efficient analytical technique, namely ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), combined with ""component-target-pathway"" network to explore the active components and potential mechanisms of EH in treating AD. Due to the high sensitivity of UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, a total of 50 components were identified in EH. Among them, 20 and 12 compounds were found in plasma and brain samples, respectively. The network pharmacology analysis revealed that apigenin, luteolin, ecliptasaponin A, chlorogenic acid, wedelolactone, and quercetin were the active components, which could affect the serotonergic synapse, calcium and cAMP signaling pathways by regulating related targets such as EGFR, PRKCA, BRAF and ERBB2. This study clarified that EH can exert anti-AD effect through multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway characteristics. Furthermore, it offers a good foundation for further in-depth research on the anti-AD effects of EH, and provides a valuable approach for the rapid screening of active components and potential mechanisms of other medicinal plants, potentially bringing changes to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,Active components; Alzheimer's disease; Ecliptae Herba; Network pharmacology; Potential mechanisms,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Molecular Structure; Plasma; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Molecular Docking Simulation","Wei, J; Wang, Y; Wang, X; Zhang, Y; Zheng, Y; Shao, J; Cheng, W; Li, Y"

Metabolic profiling of Alzheimer's disease: Untargeted metabolomics analysis of plasma samples.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often not recognized or is diagnosed very late, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of available pharmacological treatments. Metabolomic analyzes have great potential for improving existing knowledge about the pathogenesis and etiology of AD and represent a novel approach towards discovering biomarkers that could be used for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy monitoring. In this study, we applied the untargeted metabolomic approach to investigate the changes in biochemical pathways related to AD pathology. We used gas chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively) to identify metabolites whose levels have changed in subjects with AD diagnosis (N = 40) compared to healthy controls (N = 40) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 40). The GC-MS identified significant differences between groups in levels of metabolites belonging to the classes of benzene and substituted derivatives, carboxylic acids and derivatives, fatty acyls, hydroxy acids and derivatives, keto acids and derivatives, and organooxygen compounds. Most of the compounds identified by the LC-MS were various fatty acyls, glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. All of these compounds were decreased in AD patients and in subjects with MCI compared to healthy controls. The results of the study indicate disturbed metabolism of lipids and amino acids and an imbalance of metabolites involved in energy metabolism in individuals diagnosed with AD, compared to healthy controls and MCI subjects.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Metabolomics; Mild cognitive impairment; Plasma; Untargeted,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Metabolomics; Metabolome; Mass Spectrometry; Biomarkers,"Milos, T; Rojo, D; Nedic Erjavec, G; Konjevod, M; Tudor, L; Vuic, B; Svob Strac, D; Uzun, S; Mimica, N; Kozumplik, O; Barbas, C; Zarkovic, N; Pivac, N; Nikolac Perkovic, M"
TNAP and P2X7R: New Plasma Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Over the last few years, intense research efforts have been made to anticipate or improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by detecting blood biomarkers. However, the most promising blood biomarkers identified to date have some limitations, most of them related to the techniques required for their detection. Hence, new blood biomarkers should be identified to improve the diagnosis of AD, better discriminate between AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and identify cognitively unimpaired (CU) older individuals at risk for progression to AD. Our previous studies demonstrated that both the purinergic receptor P2X7 and the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ectoenzyme (TNAP) are upregulated in the brains of AD patients. Since both proteins are also present in plasma, we investigated whether plasma P2X7R and TNAP are altered in MCI and AD patients and, if so, their potential role as AD biomarkers. We found that AD but not MCI patients present increased plasma P2X7R levels. Nevertheless, TNAP plasma activity was increased in MCI patients and decreased in the AD group. ROC curve analysis indicated that measuring both parameters has a reasonable discriminating capability to diagnose MCI and AD conditions. In addition to confirming that individuals progressing to MCI have increased TNAP activity in plasma, longitudinal studies also revealed that CU individuals have lower plasma TNAP activity than stable controls. Thus, we propose that P2X7 and TNAP could serve as new plasma biomarkers for MCI and AD.",2023,Alzheimer; P2X7R; TNAP; biomarker,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Alkaline Phosphatase; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Longitudinal Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Progression; tau Proteins,"Aivar, P; Bianchi, C; Di Lauro, C; Soria-Tobar, L; Alvarez-Castelao, B; Calero, M; Medina, M; Diaz-Hernandez, M"
Effect of the Lipid Landscape on the Efficacy of Cell-Penetrating Peptides.,"Every cell biological textbook teaches us that the main role of the plasma membrane is to separate cells from their neighborhood to allow for a controlled composition of the intracellular space. The mostly hydrophobic nature of the cell membrane presents an impenetrable barrier for most hydrophilic molecules larger than 1 kDa. On the other hand, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are capable of traversing this barrier without compromising membrane integrity, and they can do so on their own or coupled to cargos. Coupling biologically and medically relevant cargos to CPPs holds great promise of delivering membrane-impermeable drugs into cells. If the cargo is able to interact with certain cell types, uptake of the CPP-drug complex can be tailored to be cell-type-specific. Besides outlining the major membrane penetration pathways of CPPs, this review is aimed at deciphering how properties of the membrane influence the uptake mechanisms of CPPs. By summarizing an extensive body of experimental evidence, we argue that a more ordered, less flexible membrane structure, often present in the very diseases planned to be treated with CPPs, decreases their cellular uptake. These correlations are not only relevant for understanding the cellular biology of CPPs, but also for rationally improving their value in translational or clinical applications.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cell-penetrating peptides; cholesterol; diabetes mellitus; lipid rafts; membrane biophysics; membrane fluidity,Cell-Penetrating Peptides; Biological Transport; Cell Membrane; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Lipids,"Zakany, F; Mándity, IM; Varga, Z; Panyi, G; Nagy, P; Kovacs, T"

inMTSCCA: An Integrated Multi-task Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multi-omic Brain Imaging Genetics.,"Identifying genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. To date, different endophenotypes, such as imaging-derived endophenotypes and proteomic expression-derived endophenotypes, have shown the great value in uncovering risk genes compared to case-control studies. Biologically, a co-varying pattern of different omics-derived endophenotypes could result from the shared genetic basis. However, existing methods mainly focus on the effect of endophenotypes alone; the effect of cross-endophenotype (CEP) associations remains largely unexploited. In this study, we used both endophenotypes and their CEP associations of multi-omic data to identify genetic risk factors, and proposed two integrated multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis (inMTSCCA) methods, i.e., pairwise endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (pcMTSCCA) and high-order endophenotype correlation-guided MTSCCA (hocMTSCCA). pcMTSCCA employed pairwise correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived, plasma-derived, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived endophenotypes as an additional penalty. hocMTSCCA used high-order correlations among these multi-omic data for regularization. To figure out genetic risk factors at individual and group levels, as well as altered endophenotypic markers, we introduced sparsity-inducing penalties for both models. We compared pcMTSCCA and hocMTSCCA with three related methods on both simulation and real (consisting of neuroimaging data, proteomic analytes, and genetic data) datasets. The results showed that our methods obtained better or comparable canonical correlation coefficients (CCCs) and better feature subsets than benchmarks. Most importantly, the identified genetic loci and heterogeneous endophenotypic markers showed high relevance. Therefore, jointly using multi-omic endophenotypes and their CEP associations is promising to reveal genetic risk factors.

Detection of early Alzheimer's disease-like molecular alterations in a mouse model expressing human ApoE4.,"The E4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) is a key genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), increasing the risk of developing the disease by up to three-fold. However, the mechanisms by which ApoE4 contributes to AD pathogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we utilize a mouse model expressing either human ApoE3 or human ApoE4 to examine the effects of the E4 allele on a wide range of genetic and molecular pathways that are altered in early AD pathology. We demonstrate that ApoE4-expressing mice begin to show early differential expression of multiple genes, leading to alterations in downstream pathways related to neural cell maintenance, insulin signaling, amyloid processing and clearance, and synaptic plasticity. These alterations may result in the earlier accumulation of pathological proteins such as β-amyloid that may build up within cells, leading to the accelerated degeneration of neurons and astrocytes as observed in ApoE4-positive individuals. We also examine the metabolic effects associated with a high-fat diet (HFD) in male ApoE4-expressing mice compared with regular chow diet (RD) fed mice at different ages. We found that young ApoE4-expressing mice fed HFD developed metabolic disturbances, such as elevated weight gain, blood glucose, and plasma insulin levels that cumulatively have been observed to increase the risk of AD in humans. Taken together, our results reveal early pathways that could mediate ApoE4-related AD risk and may help identify more tractable therapeutic targets for treating ApoE4-associated AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Apolipoprotein E; amyloid; diabetes; high-fat diet,"Humans; Mice; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Mice, Transgenic; Brain; Apolipoproteins E; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E3; Insulins","Rai, A; Ojiakor, OA; Rylett, RJ"

Hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase activity regulates cerebral Aβ metabolism and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease in mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. However, how the role of peripheral organ changes in response to environmental stimuli during aging in AD pathogenesis remains unknown. Hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) activity increases with age. Hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally attenuates brain amyloid-β (Aβ) burden, tauopathy, and cognitive deficits in AD mouse models. Moreover, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma level of 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (-EET), which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and modulates brain Aβ metabolism through multiple pathways.

HLA-A23/HLA-A24 serotypes and dementia interaction in the elderly: Association with increased soluble HLA class I molecules in plasma.,"MHC class I molecules regulate brain development and plasticity in mice and HLA class I molecules are associated with brain disorders in humans. We investigated the relationship between plasma-derived soluble human HLA class I molecules (sHLA class I), HLA class I serotypes and dementia. A cohort of HLA class I serotyped elderly subjects with no dementia/pre-dementia (NpD, n = 28), or with dementia (D, n = 28) was studied. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the influence of dementia and HLA class I serotype on sHLA class I levels, and to compare sHLA class I within four groups according to the presence or absence of HLA-A23/A24 and dementia. HLA-A23/A24 and dementia, but not age, significantly influenced the level of sHLA class I. Importantly, the concurrent presence of HLA-A23/A24 and dementia was associated with higher levels of sHLA class I (p < 0.001). This study has shown that the simultaneous presence of HLA-A23/HLA-A24 and dementia is associated with high levels of serum sHLA class I molecules. Thus, sHLA class I could be considered a biomarker of neurodegeneration in certain HLA class I carriers.",2023,Alzheimer's; MHC; Parkinson's; biomarkers; dementia; immunoregulation; neurodegeneration; soluble HLA class I,Humans; Animals; Mice; Aged; HLA-A24 Antigen; Serogroup; Alleles; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Dementia,"Cardoso, EM; Lourenço-Gomes, V; Esgalhado, AJ; Reste-Ferreira, D; Oliveira, N; Amaral, AS; Martinho, A; Gama, JMR; Verde, I; Lourenço, O; Fonseca, AM; Buchli, R; Arosa, FA"

Antioxidant system alterations and physiological characteristics of neonatal and juvenile DAT-KO rats.,"Dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) rats represent a valuable rodent model for studying the molecular and phenotypical outcomes of the effects of excessive dopamine accumulation in the synaptic cleft and the prolonged action of dopamine on neurons. Animals with DAT deficiency are characterized by hyperactivity, stereotypy, cognitive deficits, and impairments in behavioral and biochemical indicators. Several key pathophysiological mechanisms are known to be common to psychiatric, neurodegenerative, metabolic, and other diseases. Among these mechanisms, oxidative stress systems play a particularly important role. One of the main antioxidant systems in the brain is glutathione: specifically, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and catalase play a significant role in the regulation of vital oxidative processes, and their dysfunction has been shown in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. The current study aimed to analyze the dynamics of the activity levels of glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase in erythrocytes, as well as catalase in the blood plasma, of DAT-deficient, homo- and heterozygous, neonatal and juvenile rats (both male and female). Their behavioral and physiological parameters were evaluated at the age of 1.5 months. For the first time, changes in physiological and biochemical parameters were shown in DAT-KO rats at 1.5 months of postnatal life. The key role of glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and catalase in the regulation of oxidative stress in DAT-KO rats at the 5th week of life was demonstrated. A positive effect of a slightly increased dopamine level on memory function was shown in DAT-heterozygous animals.",2023,catalase; dopamine transporter; glutathione S-transferase; glutathione reductase; oxidative stress,Rats; Male; Female; Animals; Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Antioxidants; Catalase; Dopamine; Glutathione; Glutathione Transferase,"Apryatin, SA; Traktirov, DS; Karpenko, MN; Ivleva, IS; Pestereva, NS; Bolshakova, MV; Trofimov, AN; Fesenko, ZS; Klimenko, VM"

Atypical White Matter Hyperintensities Markedly Impact Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain Variability in GRN Patients.,"GRN mutations, causing frontotemporal dementia, can be associated with atypical white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We hypothesized that the presence of WMH may impact neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, markers of neuroaxonal damage. We analyzed plasma NfL in 20 GRN patients and studied their association to visually-scored WMH burden. The 12 patients displaying atypical WMH had significantly higher NfL levels (98.4±34.9 pg/mL) than those without WMH (47.2±29.4 pg/mL, p = 0.003), independently from age, disease duration and Fazekas-Schmidt grade.

Advances in peripheral blood biomarkers of patients with Alzheimer's disease: Moving closer to personalized therapies.,"Recently, measurable peripheral biomarkers in the plasma of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have gained considerable clinical interest. Several studies have identified one or more blood signatures that may facilitate the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. For instance, changes in peripheral amyloid β42 (Aβ42) levels have been largely investigated in patients with AD and correlated with the progression of the pathology, although with controversial results. In addition, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) has been identified as an inflammatory biomarker strongly associated with AD, and several studies have consistently suggested the pharmacological targeting of TNFα to reduce systemic inflammation and prevent neurotoxicity in AD. Moreover, alterations in plasma metabolite levels appear to predict the progression of systemic processes relevant to brain functions. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the levels of Aβ42, TNFα, and plasma metabolites in subjects with AD and compared the results with those in healthy elderly (HE) subjects. Differences in plasma metabolites of patients with AD were analyzed with respect to Aβ42, TNFα, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, searching for plasma signatures that changed simultaneously. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of the Tyr682 residue of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which we previously proposed as a biomarker of AD, were measured in five HE and five AD patients, in whom the levels of Aβ42, TNFα, and two plasma lipid metabolites increased simultaneously. Overall, this study highlights the potential of combining different plasma signatures to define specific clinical phenotypes of patient subgroups, thus paving the way for the stratification of patients with AD and development of personalized approaches.",2023,APP Tyr682; Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ42; Peripheral blood biomarkers; Phosphatidylcholines; Plasma metabolites; TNFα,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Peptide Fragments; tau Proteins,"Ferretti, G; Serafini, S; Angiolillo, A; Monterosso, P; Di Costanzo, A; Matrone, C"

PETCH-DB: a Portal for Exploring Tissue-specific and Complex disease-associated 5-Hydroxymethylcytosines.,"Epigenetic modifications play critical roles in gene regulation and disease pathobiology. Highly sensitive enabling technologies, including microarray- and sequencing-based approaches have allowed genome-wide profiling of cytosine modifications in DNAs in clinical samples to facilitate discovery of epigenetic biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Historically, many previous studies, however, did not distinguish the most investigated 5-methylcytosines (5mC) from other modified cytosines, especially the biochemically stable 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), which have been shown to have a distinct genomic distribution and regulatory role from 5mC. Notably, during the past several years, the 5hmC-Seal, a highly sensitive chemical labeling technique, has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in clinically feasible biospecimens (e.g. a few milliliter of plasma or serum). The 5hmC-Seal technique has been utilized by our team in biomarker discovery for human cancers and other complex diseases using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), as well as the characterization of the first 5hmC Human Tissue Map. Convenient access to the accumulating 5hmC-Seal data will allow the research community to validate and re-use these results, potentially providing novel insights into epigenetic contribution to a range of human diseases. Here we introduce the PETCH-DB, an integrated database that was implemented to provide 5hmC-related results generated using the 5hmC-Seal technique. We aim the PETCH-DB to be a central portal, which will be available to the scientific community with regularly updated 5hmC data in clinical samples to reflect current advances in this field.

The Therapeutic Potential of Novel Carnosine Formulations: Perspectives for Drug Development.,"Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is an endogenous dipeptide synthesized via the activity of the ATP-dependent enzyme carnosine synthetase 1 and can be found at a very high concentration in tissues with a high metabolic rate, including muscles (up to 20 mM) and brain (up to 5 mM). Because of its well-demonstrated multimodal pharmacodynamic profile, which includes anti-aggregant, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as its ability to modulate the energy metabolism status in immune cells, this dipeptide has been investigated in numerous experimental models of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, and at a clinical level. The main limit for the therapeutic use of carnosine is related to its rapid hydrolysis exerted by carnosinases, especially at the plasma level, reason why the development of new strategies, including the chemical modification of carnosine or its vehiculation into innovative drug delivery systems (DDS), aiming at increasing its bioavailability and/or at facilitating the site-specific transport to different tissues, is of utmost importance. In the present review, after a description of carnosine structure, biological activities, administration routes, and metabolism, we focused on different DDS, including vesicular systems and metallic nanoparticles, as well as on possible chemical derivatization strategies related to carnosine. In particular, a basic description of the DDS employed or the derivatization/conjugation applied to obtain carnosine formulations, followed by the possible mechanism of action, is given. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that includes all the new formulations of carnosine (DDS and derivatives), allowing a decrease or complete prevention of the hydrolysis of this dipeptide exerted by carnosinases, the simultaneous blood-brain barrier crossing, the maintenance or enhancement of carnosine biological activity, and the site-specific transport to different tissues, which then offers perspectives for the development of new drugs.",2023,carnosine; conjugates; derivatives; drug delivery; drug development; nanoparticles; vesicular systems,,"Bonaccorso, A; Privitera, A; Grasso, M; Salamone, S; Carbone, C; Pignatello, R; Musumeci, T; Caraci, F; Caruso, G"

Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution of Bee Venom-Derived Phospholipase A2 Using a Sandwich ELISA after Subcutaneous Injection of New Composition Bee Venom in Rats.,"Bee venom is a traditional drug used to treat the nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and autoimmune diseases. A previous study found that bee venom and one of its components, phospholipase A2, can protect the brain by suppressing neuroinflammation and can also be used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Thus, new composition bee venom (NCBV), which has an increased phospholipase A2 content of up to 76.2%, was developed as a treatment agent for Alzheimer's disease by INISTst (Republic of Korea). The aim of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of phospholipase A2 contained in NCBV in rats. Single subcutaneous administration of NCBV at doses ranging from 0.2 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg was conducted, and pharmacokinetic parameters of bee venom-derived phospholipase A2 (bvPLA2) increased in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, no accumulation was observed following multiple dosings (0.5 mg/kg/week), and other constituents of NCBV did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of bvPLA2. After subcutaneous injection of NCBV, the tissue-to-plasma ratios of bvPLA2 for the tested nine tissues were all <1.0, indicating a limited distribution of the bvPLA2 within the tissues. The findings of this study may help understand the pharmacokinetic characteristics of bvPLA2 and provide useful information for the clinical application of NCBV.",2023,bee venom-derived phospholipase A2; new composition bee venom; pharmacokinetics; rats; tissue distribution,"Animals; Rats; Alzheimer Disease; Bee Venoms; Injections, Subcutaneous; Phospholipases A2; Tissue Distribution","Chae, SU; Jo, SJ; Lee, CB; Lee, S; Park, JH; Jung, JS; Park, ES; Bae, H; Bae, SK"
Metabolic Pathway Pairwise-Based Signature as a Potential Non-Invasive Diagnostic Marker in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Early screening, particularly in blood plasma, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to the diagnosis and prevention of AD. In addition, metabolic dysfunction has been demonstrated to be closely related to AD, which might be reflected in the whole blood transcriptome. Hence, we hypothesized that the establishment of a diagnostic model based on the metabolic signatures of blood is a workable strategy. To that end, we initially constructed metabolic pathway pairwise (MPP) signatures to characterize the interplay among metabolic pathways. Then, a series of bioinformatic methodologies, e.g., differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, network analysis, etc., were used to investigate the molecular mechanism behind AD. Moreover, an unsupervised clustering analysis based on the MPP signature profile via the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm was utilized to stratify AD patients. Finally, aimed at distinguishing AD patients from non-AD groups, a metabolic pathway-pairwise scoring system (MPPSS) was established using multi-machine learning methods. As a result, many metabolic pathways correlated to AD were disclosed, including oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, etc. NMF clustering analysis divided AD patients into two subgroups (S1 and S2), which exhibit distinct activities of metabolism and immunity. Typically, oxidative phosphorylation in S2 exhibits a lower activity than that in S1 and non-AD group, suggesting the patients in S2 might possess a more compromised brain metabolism. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis showed that the patients in S2 might have phenomena of immune suppression compared with S1 and the non-AD group. These findings indicated that S2 probably has a more severe progression of AD. Finally, MPPSS could achieve an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.77) in the training dataset, 0.71 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.77) in the testing dataset, and an AUC of 0.99 (95%CI: 0.96, 1.00) in one external validation dataset. Overall, our study successfully established a novel metabolism-based scoring system for AD diagnosis using the blood transcriptome and provided new insight into the molecular mechanism of metabolic dysfunction implicated in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; metabolic abnormalities; multi-machine learning; noninvasive diagnosis; peripheral blood,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Algorithms; Machine Learning; Cluster Analysis; Metabolic Networks and Pathways,"Feng, Y; Chen, X; Zhang, XD; Huang, C"

Transfusion with Blood Plasma from Young Mice Affects rTg4510 Transgenic Tau Mice Modeling of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain. Tangles are formed when the stabilizing protein, tau, becomes hyperphosphorylated and clumps together. There are limited treatments for AD; therefore, the exploration of new treatments is warranted. Previous research showed that plasma transfusion from young donor mice improved spatial memory and increased synaptic proteins in old transgenic APP/PS1 mice, suggesting a remediation of memory and synaptic function. In the current study, plasma was transfused from 2-3-month-old young wildtype mice (WT) to 8-month-old rTg4510 mice expressing human tau (Tau). One week after the transfusions, behavior and tau pathology were examined. We found that Tau mice injected with plasma had lower expression of phosphorylated tau (ptau) in the brain, accompanied by fewer tau tangles in the cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus and smaller tau tangles in the cortex, when compared to Tau mice injected with saline. Despite no improvement in behavior, the decreased level of ptau and tangles open the door to future studies involving plasma transfusions.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood plasma; blood transfusion; neurofibrillary tangles,,"Hernandez, CM; Barkey, RE; Craven, KM; Pedemonte, KA; Alisantosa, B; Sanchez, JO; Flinn, JM"
Leveraging Plasma Membrane Repair Therapeutics for Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Plasma membrane repair is an essential cellular mechanism that reseals membrane disruptions after a variety of insults, and compromised repair capacity can contribute to the progression of many diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are marked by membrane damage from many sources, reduced membrane integrity, elevated intracellular calcium concentrations, enhanced reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and widespread neuronal death. While the toxic intracellular effects of these changes in cellular physiology have been defined, the specific mechanism of neuronal death in certain neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. An abundance of recent evidence indicates that neuronal membrane damage and pore formation in the membrane are key contributors to neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. In this review, we have outlined evidence supporting the hypothesis that membrane damage is a contributor to neurodegenerative diseases and that therapeutically enhancing membrane repair can potentially combat neuronal death.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Parkinson’s Disease; membrane repair; neurodegeneration,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Cell Death; Cell Membrane,"Bulgart, HR; Goncalves, I; Weisleder, N"

Diagnostic Biomarkers of Amyloid and Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease: An Overview of Tests for Clinical Practice in the United States and Europe.,"Amyloid and tau biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease are widely recognized diagnostic tools for the identification of Alzheimer's disease pathology antemortem and are recommended by the most recent clinical and research guidelines. Approved biomarkers include positron emission tomography (PET)- and fluid-based markers derived from cerebrospinal fluid and, more recently, plasma. These biomarkers are still infrequently used in clinical practice, potentially due to challenges in access to and understanding of individual assay information and methodology. We provide an overview of the diagnostic biomarkers for amyloid and tau pathology that are currently available in the US and/or EU for clinical use. Available performance data from both labels/instructions for use and the scientific literature (with focus on autopsy or PET as standard of truth) are summarized to help healthcare providers navigate the biomarker landscape. All available PET amyloid and tau biomarkers demonstrate high accuracy in identifying amyloid and tau Alzheimer's disease pathology, respectively, at autopsy. Among cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, all showed accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease pathology, either based on autopsy or PET findings; greater accuracy was evident for concentration ratios (Aβ42/40 or P-tau181/Aβ42) versus individual biomarker concentrations. Among plasma biomarkers, Aβ42/40 and P-tau181 demonstrated high agreement with PET findings. Overall, we conclude that commercially available PET, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma assays accurately identify Alzheimer's disease amyloid and tau pathology. The recent development of fully automated tests for fluid-based biomarkers improves test reliability. The continued development of plasma biomarkers holds promise for the future management of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; diagnostic biomarker; tau,Humans; United States; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Reproducibility of Results; Amyloid; Biomarkers,"Iaccarino, L; Burnham, SC; Dell'Agnello, G; Dowsett, SA; Epelbaum, S"
Can We Use Blood Biomarkers as Entry Criteria and for Monitoring Drug Treatment Effects in Clinical Trials? A Report from the EU/US CTAD Task Force.,"In randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers are currently used for the detection and monitoring of AD pathological features. The use of less resource-intensive plasma biomarkers could decrease the burden to study volunteers and limit costs and time for study enrollment. Blood-based markers (BBMs) could thus play an important role in improving the design and the conduct of RCTs on AD.

Viewpoint: Clinicians' Perspectives on How Disease Modifying Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease Impact Specialty Care.,"Clinicians specialized in the diagnosis and management of persons living with early-stage Alzheimer's disease need to enable access, for those meeting criteria, to the new class of disease modifying drugs (DMDs). These drugs act on amyloid β42 and delay progression of symptoms. Thus, there will be interest from patients and families. Over the short term, the use of antibodies administered intravenously with serial MRIs to detect amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may require participation in structured phase 4 studies or in registries with third party funding for support staff and MRI scans. In the mid term, the availability of oral anti-amyloid therapy, likely with lower risk of ARIA, may transform clinical practice to a model of screening suitable patients using plasma biomarkers, with a subsequent rapid referral to a specialized memory clinic. Eventually, the biological profile of patients for amyloid, tau, and inflammation will determine which type of DMD to use. We are optimistic that clinicians will gain confidence with the use DMDs and answer the increasing needs of our aging population.",2023,Alzheimer disease; disease-modifying treatments; health care resources; patients selection,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Amyloid; Aging; Biomarkers,"Gauthier, S; Ismail, Z; Goodarzi, Z; Ng, KP; Rosa-Neto, P"

With an aging population, AD has become a major public health problem in China and worldwide. However, the physiological and pathological mechanisms of AD have not been fully elucidated, and there is a lack of effective prevention and clinical treatment methods. Many studies have found that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a good therapeutic effect on cognitive function in AD patients.

CSF proteomics in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease highlights parallels with sporadic disease.,"Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) offers a unique opportunity to study pathophysiological changes in a relatively young population with few comorbidities. A comprehensive investigation of proteome changes occurring in ADAD could provide valuable insights into AD-related biological mechanisms and uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Furthermore, ADAD might serve as a model for sporadic AD, but in-depth proteome comparisons are lacking. We aimed to identify dysregulated CSF proteins in ADAD and determine the degree of overlap with sporadic AD. We measured 1472 proteins in CSF of PSEN1 or APP mutation carriers (n = 22) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 20) from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort using proximity extension-based immunoassays (PEA). We compared protein abundance between groups with two-sided t-tests and identified enriched biological pathways. Using the same protein panels in paired plasma samples, we investigated correlations between CSF proteins and their plasma counterparts. Finally, we compared our results with recently published PEA data from an international cohort of sporadic AD (n = 230) and non-AD dementias (n = 301). All statistical analyses were false discovery rate-corrected. We detected 66 differentially abundant CSF proteins (65 increased, 1 decreased) in ADAD compared to controls (q < 0.05). The most strongly upregulated proteins (fold change >1.8) were related to immunity (CHIT1, ITGB2, SMOC2), cytoskeletal structure (MAPT, NEFL) and tissue remodelling (TMSB10, MMP-10). Significant CSF-plasma correlations were found for the upregulated proteins SMOC2 and LILR1B. Of the 66 differentially expressed proteins, 36 had been measured previously in the sporadic dementias cohort, 34 of which (94%) were also significantly upregulated in sporadic AD, with a strong correlation between the fold changes of these proteins in both cohorts (rs = 0.730, P < 0.001). Twenty-nine of the 36 proteins (81%) were also upregulated among non-AD patients with suspected AD co-pathology. This CSF proteomics study demonstrates substantial biochemical similarities between ADAD and sporadic AD, suggesting involvement of the same biological processes. Besides known AD-related proteins, we identified several relatively novel proteins, such as TMSB10, MMP-10 and SMOC2, which have potential as novel biomarkers. With shared pathophysiological CSF changes, ADAD study findings might be translatable to sporadic AD, which could greatly expedite therapy development.",2023,dementia; familial; genetic; olink; proteome,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Matrix Metalloproteinase 10; Proteomics; Proteome; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"van der Ende, EL; In 't Veld, SGJG; Hanskamp, I; van der Lee, S; Dijkstra, JIR; Hok-A-Hin, YS; Blujdea, ER; van Swieten, JC; Irwin, DJ; Chen-Plotkin, A; Hu, WT; Lemstra, AW; Pijnenburg, YAL; van der Flier, WM; Del Campo, M; Teunissen, CE; Vermunt, L"

Expansion Microscopy Application for Calcium Protein Clustering Imaging in Cells and Brain Tissues.,"Many biological studies require high-resolution imaging and subsequent analysis of cell organelles and molecules. Some membrane proteins form tight clusters, and this process is directly linked to their function. In most studies, these small protein clusters have been investigated by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which enables imaging with high spatial resolution within 100 nm of the membrane surface. Recently developed expansion microscopy (ExM) makes it possible to achieve nanometer resolution using a conventional fluorescence microscope by physically expanding the sample. In this article, we describe implementation of ExM for imaging of protein clusters formed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium sensor protein STIM1. This protein translocates during ER store depletion and forms clusters that support contact with plasma membrane (PM) calcium-channel proteins. ER calcium channels such as the type 1 inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) also form clusters, but their investigation by TIRF microscopy is impossible due to the large distance from the PM. In this article, we demonstrate how to investigate IP3R clustering using ExM in hippocampal brain tissues. We compare IP3R clustering in the CA1 area of the hippocampus of wild-type and 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease model mice. To facilitate future applications, we describe experimental protocols and image processing guidelines for application of ExM to membrane and ER protein clustering studies in cultured cells and brain tissues. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

"Perivascular spaces in Alzheimer's disease are associated with inflammatory, stress-related, and hypertension biomarkers.","Perivascular spaces (PVS) are fluid-filled spaces surrounding the brain vasculature. Literature suggests that PVS may play a significant role in aging and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cortisol, a stress hormone, has been implicated in the development and progression of AD. Hypertension, a common condition in older adults, has been found to be a risk factor for AD. Hypertension may contribute to PVS enlargement, impairing the clearance of waste products from the brain and promoting neuroinflammation. This study aims to understand the potential interactions between PVS, cortisol, hypertension, and inflammation in the context of cognitive impairment. Using MRI scans acquired at 1.5T, PVS were quantified in a cohort of 465 individuals with cognitive impairment. PVS was calculated in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale using an automated segmentation approach. Levels of cortisol and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (an indicator of hypertension) were measured from plasma. Inflammatory biomarkers, such as cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, were analyzed using advanced laboratory techniques. Main effect and interaction analyses were performed to examine the associations between PVS severity, cortisol levels, hypertension, and inflammatory biomarkers. In the centrum semiovale, higher levels of inflammation reduced cortisol associations with PVS volume fraction. For ACE, an inverse association with PVS was seen only when interacting with TNFr2 (a transmembrane receptor of TNF). There was also a significant inverse main effect of TNFr2. In the PVS basal ganglia, a significant positive association was found with TRAIL (a TNF receptor inducing apoptosis). These findings show for the first time the intricate relationships between PVS structure and the levels of stress-related, hypertension, and inflammatory biomarkers. This research could potentially guide future studies regarding the underlying mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and the potential development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these inflammation factors.",2023,,,"Sibilia, F; Sheikh-Bahaei, N; Mack, WJ; Choupan, J"

Plasma NfL as a prognostic biomarker for enriching HD-ISS stage 1 categorisation: a cross-sectional study.,"The recently proposed Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System (HD-ISS) categorises individuals with the Huntintin genetic mutation into disease progression cohorts based on quantitative neuroimaging, cognitive, and functional markers for research purposes. Unfortunately, many research studies do not collect quantitative neuroimaging data, and so the authors of the HD-ISS have subsequently provided approximated cohort thresholds based on disease and clinical data alone. However, these are rough proxies that aim to maximise stage separation, and should not be considered as 1:1 substitutes for the HD-ISS. Notably, no wet biomarker met the stringent criteria required to be considered a landmark for HD-ISS categorisation. We have previously shown that levels of plasma neurofilament light (NfL), a neuronal marker associated with axonal injury, are associated with predicted years to clinical motor diagnosis (CMD).

Associations of Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Aβ and tau Levels with Renal Function.,"Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that brain-derived Aβ and tau can be cleared through transport into the periphery, and the kidneys may be vital organs involved in the clearance of Aβ and tau. However, the effects of deficiency in the clearance of Aβ and tau by the kidneys on brain AD-type pathologies in humans remain largely unknown. In this study, we first recruited 41 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 40 age- and sex-matched controls with normal renal function to analyze the associations of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with plasma Aβ and tau levels. To analyze the associations of eGFR with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, we recruited 42 cognitively normal CKD patients and 150 cognitively normal controls with CSF samples. Compared with controls with normal renal function, CKD patients had higher plasma levels of Aβ40, Aβ42 and total tau (T-tau), lower CSF levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 and higher levels of CSF T-tau/Aβ42 and phosphorylated tau (P-tau)/Aβ42. Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and T-tau levels were negatively correlated with eGFR. In addition, eGFR was negatively correlated with CSF levels of T-tau, T-tau/Aβ42, and P-tau/Aβ42 but positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores.

To study the effect of ER flux with buffer on the neuronal calcium.,"Calcium signaling is decisive for cellular functions. This calcium random walk stipulates neuronal functions. Calcium concentration could provoke gene transcription, apoptosis, neuronal plasticity, etc. A malformation in calcium could change the neuron's intracellular behavior. Calcium concentration balancing is a complex cellular mechanism. This occurrence can be handled with the Caputo fractional reaction-diffusion equation. In this mathematical modeling, we have included the STIM-Orai mechanism and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) flux, Inositol Triphosphate Receptor (IPR), SERCA, plasma membrane flux, voltage-gated calcium entry, and different buffer interactions. A hybrid integral transform and Green's function approach were taken to solve the initial boundary problem. A closed-form solution of a Mittag-Leffler family function plotted using MATLAB software. Different parameters impact changes in the spatiotemporal behavior of the calcium concentration. Specific roles of organelles involved in Alzheimer's disease-affected neurons are computed. Ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), and S100B protein effects are also observed. In all simulations, we can say S100B and the STIM-Orai effect cannot be neglected. This model lights up the different approaches for calcium signaling pathway simulation. As a consequence, we determine that a generalized reaction-diffusion approach is a better fit realistic model.",2023,,,"Vatsal, VH; Jha, BK; Singh, TP"
A Targeted Mass Spectrometry Approach to Identify Peripheral Changes in Metabolic Pathways of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. Since its original description, there has been intense debate regarding the factors that trigger its pathology. It is becoming apparent that AD is more than a brain disease and harms the whole-body metabolism. We analyzed 630 polar and apolar metabolites in the blood of 20 patients with AD and 20 healthy individuals, to determine whether the composition of plasma metabolites could offer additional indicators to evaluate any alterations in the metabolic pathways related to the illness. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that there were at least 25 significantly dysregulated metabolites in patients with AD compared with the controls. Two membrane lipid components, glycerophospholipids and ceramide, were upregulated, whereas glutamic acid, other phospholipids, and sphingolipids were downregulated. The data were analyzed using metabolite set enrichment analysis and pathway analysis using the KEGG library. The results showed that at least five pathways involved in the metabolism of polar compounds were dysregulated in patients with AD. Conversely, the lipid pathways did not show significant alterations. These results support the possibility of using metabolome analysis to understand alterations in the metabolic pathways related to AD pathophysiology.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; lipidomic profile; metabolomic profile; targeted mass spectrometry,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Metabolomics; Metabolome; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolic Networks and Pathways,"Reveglia, P; Paolillo, C; Angiolillo, A; Ferretti, G; Angelico, R; Sirabella, R; Corso, G; Matrone, C; Di Costanzo, A"

Sexual dimorphic metabolic and cognitive responses of C57BL/6 mice to Fisetin or Dasatinib and quercetin cocktail oral treatment.,"Senolytic treatment in aged mice clears senescent cell burden leading to functional improvements. However, less is known regarding the effects of these compounds when administered prior to significant senescent cell accumulation. From 4-13 months of age, C57BL/6 male and female mice received monthly oral dosing of either 100 mg/kg Fisetin or a 5 mg/kg Dasatinib (D) plus 50 mg/kg Quercetin (Q) cocktail. During treatment, several aspects of healthy aging were assayed including glucose metabolism using an insulin and glucose tolerance test, cognitive performance using Morris water maze and novel object recognition, and energy metabolism using indirect calorimetry. Afterwards, mice were euthanized for plasma, tissue specific markers of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and white adipose tissue accumulation (WAT). Sexually dimorphic treatment effects were observed. Fisetin treated male mice had reduced SASP, enhanced glucose and energy metabolism, improved cognitive performance, and increased mRNA expression of adiponectin receptor 1 and glucose transporter 4. D + Q treatment had minimal effects in male C57BL/6 mice, but was detrimental to females causing increased SASP expression along with accumulation of WAT depots. Reduced energy metabolism and cognitive performance were also noted. Fisetin treatment had no effect in female C57BL/6 mice potentially due to a slower rate of biological aging. In summary, the senolytic treatment in young adulthood, has beneficial, negligible, or detrimental effects in C57BL/6 mice dependent upon sex and treatment. These observations should serve as a note of caution in this rapidly evolving and expanding field of investigation. Male and female C57BL/6 mice were treated with once monthly oral doses of either Dasatinib (D) + Quercetin (Q) or Fisetin from 4-13 months of age. Males treated with Fisetin had reduced SASP markers (blue spheres) as well as improved metabolism (red flame) and cognition. Females treated with D + Q had increased adiposity and SASP markers (red spheres) along with decreased metabolism (blue flame) and cognitive performance.

"Location of pathogenic variants in PSEN1 impacts progression of cognitive, clinical, and neurodegenerative measures in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.","Although pathogenic variants in PSEN1 leading to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) are highly penetrant, substantial interindividual variability in the rates of cognitive decline and biomarker change are observed in ADAD. We hypothesized that this interindividual variability may be associated with the location of the pathogenic variant within PSEN1. PSEN1 pathogenic variant carriers participating in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study were grouped based on whether the underlying variant affects a transmembrane (TM) or cytoplasmic (CY) protein domain within PSEN1. CY and TM carriers and variant non-carriers (NC) who completed clinical evaluation, multimodal neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture for collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as part of their participation in DIAN were included in this study. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine differences in clinical, cognitive, and biomarker measures between the NC, TM, and CY groups. While both the CY and TM groups were found to have similarly elevated Aβ compared to NC, TM carriers had greater cognitive impairment, smaller hippocampal volume, and elevated phosphorylated tau levels across the spectrum of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of disease as compared to CY, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. As distinct portions of PSEN1 are differentially involved in APP processing by γ-secretase and the generation of toxic β-amyloid species, these results have important implications for understanding the pathobiology of ADAD and accounting for a substantial portion of the interindividual heterogeneity in ongoing ADAD clinical trials.",2023,PSEN1; Presenilin-1; Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD); heterogeneity; neurodegeneration,Humans; Male; Female; Adult; Brain; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Presenilin-1; Mutation; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Biomarkers,"Schultz, SA; Shirzadi, Z; Schultz, AP; Liu, L; Fitzpatrick, CD; McDade, E; Barthelemy, NR; Renton, A; Esposito, B; Joseph-Mathurin, N; Cruchaga, C; Chen, CD; Goate, A; Allegri, RF; Benzinger, TLS; Berman, S; Chui, HC; Fagan, AM; Farlow, MR; Fox, NC; Gordon, BA; Day, GS; Graff-Radford, NR; Hassenstab, JJ; Hanseeuw, BJ; Hofmann, A; Jack, CR; Jucker, M; Karch, CM; Koeppe, RA; Lee, JH; Levey, AI; Levin, J; Martins, RN; Mori, H; Morris, JC; Noble, J; Perrin, RJ; Rosa-Neto, P; Salloway, SP; Sanchez-Valle, R; Schofield, PR; Xiong, C; Johnson, KA; Bateman, RJ; Sperling, RA; Chhatwal, JP"

Biomarkers of central and peripheral inflammation mediate the association between HIV and depressive symptoms.,"People living with HIV are at increased risk for depression, though the underlying mechanisms for this are unclear. In the general population, depression is associated with peripheral and central inflammation. Given this, and since HIV infection elicits inflammation, we hypothesised that peripheral and central inflammatory biomarkers would at least partly mediate the association between HIV and depressive symptoms. People living with HIV (n = 125) and without HIV (n = 79) from the COmorBidity in Relation to AIDS (COBRA) cohort were included in this study. Participants living with and without HIV had similar baseline characteristics. All participants living with HIV were on antiretroviral therapy and were virally suppressed. Plasma, CSF, and brain MR spectroscopy (MRS) biomarkers were measured. Using logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, we found that participants with HIV were more likely to have Any Depressive Symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score >4) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 3.27 [1.46, 8.09]). We then sequentially adjusted the models for each biomarker separately to determine the mediating role of each biomarker, with a >10% reduction in OR considered as evidence of potential mediation. Of the biomarkers analysed, MIG (-15.0%) and TNF-α (-11.4%) in plasma and MIP1-α (-21.0%) and IL-6 (-18.0%) in CSF mediated the association between HIV and depressive symptoms in this sample. None of the other soluble or neuroimaging biomarkers substantially mediated this association.

Genetic risk scores enhance the diagnostic value of plasma biomarkers of brain amyloidosis.,"Blood-based biomarkers offer strong potential to revolutionize diagnosis, trial enrolment and treatment monitoring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, further advances are needed before these biomarkers can achieve wider deployment beyond selective research studies and specialty memory clinics, including the development of frameworks for optimal interpretation of biomarker profiles. We hypothesized that integrating Alzheimer's disease genetic risk score (AD-GRS) data would enhance the diagnostic value of plasma AD biomarkers by better capturing extant disease heterogeneity. Analysing 962 individuals from a population-based sample, we observed that an AD-GRS was independently associated with amyloid PET levels (an early marker of AD pathophysiology) over and above APOE ε4 or plasma p-tau181, amyloid-β42/40, glial fibrillary acidic protein or neurofilament light chain. Among individuals with a high or moderately high plasma p-tau181, integrating AD-GRS data significantly improved classification accuracy of amyloid PET positivity, including the finding that the combination of a high AD-GRS and high plasma p-tau181 outperformed p-tau181 alone in classifying amyloid PET positivity (88% versus 68%; P = 0.001). A machine learning approach incorporating plasma biomarkers, demographics and the AD-GRS was highly accurate in predicting amyloid PET levels (90% training set; 89% test set) and Shapley value analyses (an explainer method based in cooperative game theory) indicated that the AD-GRS and plasma biomarkers had differential importance in explaining amyloid deposition across individuals. Polygenic risk for AD dementia appears to account for a unique portion of disease heterogeneity, which could non-invasively enhance the interpretation of blood-based AD biomarker profiles in the population.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); PET; amyloid; plasma biomarkers; polygenic risk score,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Amyloidosis; Brain; Biomarkers; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Risk Factors,"Ramanan, VK; Gebre, RK; Graff-Radford, J; Hofrenning, E; Algeciras-Schimnich, A; Figdore, DJ; Lowe, VJ; Mielke, MM; Knopman, DS; Ross, OA; Jack, CR; Petersen, RC; Vemuri, P"
Concentration of Phosphatidylserine Influence Rates of Insulin Aggregation and Toxicity of Amyloid Aggregates In Vitro.,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a negatively charged lipid that plays a critically important role in cell apoptosis. Under physiological conditions, PS is localized on the cytosolic side of plasma membranes via ATP-dependent flippase-mediated transport. A decrease in the ATP levels in the cell, which is taken place upon pathological processes, results in the increase in PS concentration on the exterior part of the cell membranes. PS on the outer membrane surfaces attracts and activates phagocytes, which trigger cell apoptosis. This programed irreversible cell death is observed upon the progressive neurodegeneration, a hallmark of numerous amyloid associated pathologies, such as diabetes type 2 and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigate the extent to which the rates of protein aggregation, which occurs upon amyloid pathologies, can be altered by the concentration of PS in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). We found that with an increase in the concentration of PS from 20 to 40% relative to the concentration of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the rate of insulin aggregation, protein linked to diabetes type 2, and injection amyloidosis drastically increased. Furthermore, the concentration of PS in LUVs determined the secondary structure of protein aggregates formed in their presence. We also found that these structurally different aggregates exerted distinctly different cell toxicities. These findings suggest that a substantial decrease in cell viability, which is likely to take place upon aging, results in the increase in the concentration of PS in the outer plasma membranes, where it triggers the irreversible self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins, which, in turn, causes the progressive neurodegeneration.",2023,AFM-IR; fibrils; insulin; oligomers; phosphatidylserine,"Humans; Phosphatidylserines; Insulin; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Amyloid; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Adenosine Triphosphate","Matveyenka, M; Zhaliazka, K; Kurouski, D"

Gamma neuromodulation improves episodic memory and its associated network in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: a pilot study.,"Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease associated with dysfunctional episodic memory and limited treatment options.

Feasibility, episodic memory, and plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers were assessed. Neuroplastic changes were characterized by resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance. Gamma tACS was feasible and aMCI participants demonstrated improvement in multiple metrics of episodic memory, but no changes in biomarkers. Improvements in episodic memory were most pronounced in participants who had the highest modeled tACS-induced electric fields and exhibited the greatest changes in RSFC. Increased RSFC was also associated with greater hippocampal excitability and higher baseline white matter integrity.

Plasma biomarkers for prediction of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change.,"While plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasingly being evaluated for clinical diagnosis and prognosis, few population-based autopsy studies have evaluated their utility in the context of predicting neuropathological changes. Our goal was to investigate the utility of clinically available plasma markers in predicting Braak staging, neuritic plaque score, Thal phase, and overall AD neuropathological change (ADNC).We utilized a population-based prospective study of 350 participants with autopsy and antemortem plasma biomarker testing using clinically available antibody assay (Quanterix) consisting of Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL. We utilized a variable selection procedure in cross-validated (CV) logistic regression models to identify the best set of plasma predictors along with demographic variables, and a subset of neuropsychological tests comprising the Mayo Clinic Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (Mayo-PACC). ADNC was best predicted with plasma GFAP, NfL, p-tau181 biomarkers along with APOE ε4 carrier status and Mayo-PACC cognitive score (CV AUC = 0.798). Braak staging was best predicted using plasma GFAP, p-tau181, and cognitive scores (CV AUC = 0.774). Neuritic plaque score was best predicted using plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL biomarkers (CV AUC = 0.770). Thal phase was best predicted using GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, APOE ε4 carrier status and Mayo-PACC cognitive score (CV AUC = 0.754). We found that GFAP and p-tau provided non-overlapping information on both neuritic plaque and Braak stage scores whereas Aβ42/40 and NfL were mainly useful for prediction of neuritic plaque scores. Separating participants by cognitive status improved predictive performance, particularly when plasma biomarkers were included.

Higher immune-related gene expression in major depression is independent of CRP levels: results from the BIODEP study.,"Compelling evidence demonstrates that some individuals suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit increased levels of inflammation. Most studies focus on inflammation-related proteins, such as serum or plasma C-reactive protein (CRP). However, the immune-related modifications associated with MDD may be not entirely captured by CRP alone. Analysing mRNA gene expression levels, we aimed to identify broader molecular immune-related phenotypes of MDD. We examined 168 individuals from the non-interventional, case-control, BIODEP study, 128 with a diagnosis of MDD and 40 healthy controls. Individuals with MDD were further divided according to serum high-sensitivity (hs)CRP levels (n = 59 with CRP <1, n = 33 with CRP 1-3 and n = 36 with CRP >3 mg/L). We isolated RNA from whole blood and performed gene expression analyses using RT-qPCR. We measured the expression of 16 immune-related candidate genes: A2M, AQP4, CCL2, CXCL12, CRP, FKBP5, IL-1-beta, IL-6, ISG15, MIF, GR, P2RX7, SGK1, STAT1, TNF-alpha and USP18. Nine of the 16 candidate genes were differentially expressed in MDD cases vs. controls, with no differences between CRP-based groups. Only CRP mRNA was clearly associated with serum CRP. In contrast, plasma (proteins) IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-16, IL-17A, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, and neutrophils counts, were all differentially regulated between CRP-based groups (higher in CRP >3 vs. CRP <1 and/or controls), reflecting the gradient of CRP values. Secondary analyses on MDD individuals and controls with CRP values <1 mg/L (usually interpreted as 'no inflammation') confirmed MDD cases still had significantly different mRNA expression of immune-related genes compared with controls. These findings corroborate an immune-related molecular activation in MDD, which appears to be independent of serum CRP levels. Additional biological mechanisms may then be required to translate this mRNA signature into inflammation at protein and cellular levels. Understanding these mechanisms will help to uncover the true immune abnormalities in depression, opening new paths for diagnosis and treatment.",2023,,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Depression; Interleukin-6; C-Reactive Protein; Inflammation; RNA, Messenger; Gene Expression; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","Sforzini, L; Cattaneo, A; Ferrari, C; Turner, L; Mariani, N; Enache, D; Hastings, C; Lombardo, G; Nettis, MA; Nikkheslat, N; Worrell, C; Zajkowska, Z; Kose, M; Cattane, N; Lopizzo, N; Mazzelli, M; Pointon, L; Cowen, PJ; Cavanagh, J; Harrison, NA; Jones, D; Drevets, WC; Mondelli, V; Bullmore, ET; Pariante, CM"
Effects of donepezil treatment on plasma and urine metabolites in amyloid beta-induced Alzheimer's disease rats.,"Accumulated clinical and biomedical evidence suggests that abnormalities in systemic metabolic processes such as fatty acid and amino acid metabolism can affect the brain function and behavior of various central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, metabolic profiling was used to investigate changes in plasma and urine metabolites following stereotactic injection of amyloid β (Aβ) and treatment with donepezil in rats. Aβ causes cognitive impairment, while donepezil treatment successfully improves memory impairment. Donepezil improves Aβ-induced plasma fatty acid and bile acid metabolism disorders, as well as Aβ-induced urine phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolism disorders in rats. More specifically, the plasma fatty acids improved by donepezil include alpha-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid, among others. Additionally, donepezil significantly restored the downregulation of bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and glycocholic acid caused by Aβ. As for urine metabolites, phenylacetylglycine, epinephrine, and other phenylalanine metabolites, as well as kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, and other tryptophan metabolites, were worsened by Aβ and improved by donepezil. These findings suggest that the cognitive impairment induced by Aβ and the improvement by donepezil are associated with changes in metabolic disorders in rats. This study provides basic data for the effects of Aβ and donepezil on plasma and urine metabolites in Aβ-induced AD rat models.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Donepezil; Metabolomics; UPLC-Q-TOF-MS,"Rats; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Donepezil; Tryptophan; Fatty Acids; Disease Models, Animal","Huang, H; Fang, C; Niu, H; Yin, X; Ruan, J; Wei, M; Zhou, Y"

Astrocyte reactivity influences amyloid-β effects on tau pathology in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"An unresolved question for the understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology is why a significant percentage of amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals do not develop detectable downstream tau pathology and, consequently, clinical deterioration. In vitro evidence suggests that reactive astrocytes unleash Aβ effects in pathological tau phosphorylation. Here, in a biomarker study across three cohorts (n = 1,016), we tested whether astrocyte reactivity modulates the association of Aβ with tau phosphorylation in CU individuals.

TREM2 Expression and Amyloid-Beta Phagocytosis in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of dementia; its key pathological findings include the deposition of extracellular-neurotoxic-plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Ab). AD-pathogenesis involves mechanisms that operate outside the brain, and new researches indicate that peripheral inflammation is an early event in the disease. Herein, we focus on a receptor known as triggering-receptor-expressed-on-myeloid-cells2 (TREM2), which promotes the optimal immune cells function required to attenuate AD-progression and is, therefore, a potential target as peripheral diagnostic and prognostic-biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease. The objective of this exploratory study was to analyze: (1) soluble-TREM2 (sTREM2) plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentration, (2) TREM2-mRNA, (3) the percentage of TREM2-expressing monocytes, and (4) the concentration of miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p suspected to influence TREM2 transcription.

Pathophysiological Role of Microglial Activation Induced by Blood-Borne Proteins in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts entry of neurotoxic plasma components, blood cells, and pathogens into the brain, leading to proper neuronal functioning. BBB impairment leads to blood-borne protein infiltration such as prothrombin, thrombin, prothrombin kringle-2, fibrinogen, fibrin, and other harmful substances. Thus, microglial activation and release of pro-inflammatory mediators commence, resulting in neuronal damage and leading to impaired cognition via neuroinflammatory responses, which are important features observed in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Moreover, these blood-borne proteins cluster with the amyloid beta plaque in the brain, exacerbating microglial activation, neuroinflammation, tau phosphorylation, and oxidative stress. These mechanisms work in concert and reinforce each other, contributing to the typical pathological changes in AD in the brain. Therefore, the identification of blood-borne proteins and the mechanisms involved in microglial activation and neuroinflammatory damage can be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD prevention. In this article, we review the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of microglial activation-mediated neuroinflammation caused by the influx of blood-borne proteins into the brain via BBB disruption. Subsequently, the mechanisms of drugs that inhibit blood-borne proteins, as a potential therapeutic approach for AD, along with the limitations and potential challenges of these approaches, are also summarized.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; blood-borne protein; blood–brain barrier; microglia; neurodegeneration; neuroinflammation,,"Kim, S; Sharma, C; Jung, UJ; Kim, SR"

Low circulating adropin concentrations predict increased risk of cognitive decline in community-dwelling older adults.,"The secreted peptide adropin is highly expressed in human brain tissues and correlates with RNA and proteomic risk indicators for dementia. Here we report that plasma adropin concentrations predict risk for cognitive decline in the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT00672685; mean age 75.8y, SD = 4.5 years, 60.2% female, n = 452). Cognitive ability was evaluated using a composite cognitive score (CCS) that assessed four domains: memory, language, executive function, and orientation. Relationships between plasma adropin concentrations and changes in CCS (∆CCS) were examined using Cox Proportional Hazards Regression, or by grouping into tertiles ranked low to high by adropin values and controlling for age, time between baseline and final visits, baseline CCS, and other risk factors (e.g., education, medication, APOE4 status). Risk of cognitive decline (defined as a ∆CCS of - 0.3 or more) decreased with increasing plasma adropin concentrations (hazard ratio = 0.873, 95% CI 0.780-0.977, P = 0.018).

Plasma Extracellular Vesicle MicroRNA Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Reveals Dysfunction of a Neural Correlation Network.,"Small extracellular vesicle (sEV) is an emerging source of potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in sEV is not well understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sEV-derived miRNAs in AD using small RNA sequencing and coexpression network analysis. We examined a total of 158 samples, including 48 from AD patients, 48 from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 62 from healthy controls. We identified an miRNA network module (M1) that was strongly linked to neural function and showed the strongest association with AD diagnosis and cognitive impairment. The expression of miRNAs in the module was decreased in both AD and MCI patients compared to controls. Conservation analysis revealed that M1 was highly preserved in the healthy control group but dysfunctional in the AD and MCI groups, suggesting that changes in the expression of miRNAs in this module may be an early response to cognitive decline prior to the appearance of AD pathology. We further validated the expression levels of the hub miRNAs in M1 in an independent population. The functional enrichment analysis showed that 4 hub miRNAs might interact with a GDF11-centered network and play a critical role in the neuropathology of AD. In summary, our study provides new insights into the role of sEV-derived miRNAs in AD and suggests that M1 miRNAs may serve as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD.",2023,,,"Sun, Y; Hefu, Z; Li, B; Lifang, W; Zhijie, S; Zhou, L; Deng, Y; Zhili, L; Ding, J; Li, T; Zhang, W; Chao, N; Rong, S"

New insights into the function and pathophysiology of the ectodomain sheddase A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10).,"The 'A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 10' (ADAM10) has gained considerable attention due to its discovery as an 'α-secretase' involved in the nonamyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, thereby possibly preventing the excessive generation of the amyloid beta peptide, which is associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. ADAM10 was found to exert many additional functions, cleaving about 100 different membrane proteins. ADAM10 is involved in many pathophysiological conditions, ranging from cancer and autoimmune disorders to neurodegeneration and inflammation. ADAM10 cleaves its substrates close to the plasma membrane, a process referred to as ectodomain shedding. This is a central step in the modulation of the functions of cell adhesion proteins and cell surface receptors. ADAM10 activity is controlled by transcriptional and post-translational events. The interaction of ADAM10 with tetraspanins and the way they functionally and structurally depend on each other is another topic of interest. In this review, we will summarize findings on how ADAM10 is regulated and what is known about the biology of the protease. We will focus on novel aspects of the molecular biology and pathophysiology of ADAM10 that were previously poorly covered, such as the role of ADAM10 on extracellular vesicles, its contribution to virus entry, and its involvement in cardiac disease, cancer, inflammation, and immune regulation. ADAM10 has emerged as a regulator controlling cell surface proteins during development and in adult life. Its involvement in disease states suggests that ADAM10 may be exploited as a therapeutic target to treat conditions associated with a dysfunctional proteolytic activity.",2024,ADAM10; cancer; ectodomain shedding; immune system; regulation,Humans; ADAM10 Protein; Animals; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Membrane Proteins; Neoplasms; Alzheimer Disease; Inflammation,"Rosenbaum, D; Saftig, P"

Brain-derived extracellular vesicles promote bone-fat imbalance in Alzheimer's disease.,"Inadequate osteogenesis and excessive adipogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are key factors in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a higher incidence of osteoporosis than healthy adults, but the underlying mechanism is not clear.

Long-term clinical intervention is necessary for neurological diseases where neural stem cell transplantation has made substantial progress. However, many risks remain for cell therapy, such as puncture bleeding, postoperative infection, low transplantation success rate, and tumor formation. Sustained drug delivery, which aims to maintain the desired steady-state drug concentrations in plasma or local injection sites, is considered as a feasible option to help overcome side effects and improve the therapeutic efficiency of drugs on neurological diseases. Natural polymers such as silk fibroin have excellent biocompatibility, which can be prepared for various end-use material formats, such as microsphere, gel, coating/film, scaffold/conduit, microneedle, and enables the dynamic release of loaded drugs to achieve a desired therapeutic response. Sustained-release drug delivery systems are based on the mechanism of diffusion and degradation by altering the structures of silk fibroin and drugs, factors, and cells, which can induce nerve recovery and restore the function of the nervous system in a slow and persistent manner. Based on these desirable properties of silk fibroin as a carrier with sustained-release capacity, this paper discusses the role of various forms of silk fibroin-based drug delivery materials in treating neurological diseases in recent years.",2023,TBI; drug delivery; neurological diseases; silk fibroin; sustained release; traumatic brain injury,,"Huang, X; An, Y; Yuan, S; Chen, C; Shan, H; Zhang, M"
Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 elevation contributes to age-associated cognitive decline.,"Elderly individuals frequently report cognitive decline, while various studies indicate hippocampal functional declines with advancing age. Hippocampal function is influenced by ghrelin through hippocampus-expressed growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) is an endogenous GHSR antagonist that attenuates ghrelin signaling. Here, we measured plasma ghrelin and LEAP2 levels in a cohort of cognitively normal individuals older than 60 and found that LEAP2 increased with age while ghrelin (also referred to in literature as ""acyl-ghrelin"") marginally declined. In this cohort, plasma LEAP2/ghrelin molar ratios were inversely associated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Studies in mice showed an age-dependent inverse relationship between plasma LEAP2/ghrelin molar ratio and hippocampal lesions. In aged mice, restoration of the LEAP2/ghrelin balance to youth-associated levels with lentiviral shRNA Leap2 downregulation improved cognitive performance and mitigated various age-related hippocampal deficiencies such as CA1 region synaptic loss, declines in neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation. Our data collectively suggest that LEAP2/ghrelin molar ratio elevation may adversely affect hippocampal function and, consequently, cognitive performance; thus, it may serve as a biomarker of age-related cognitive decline. Moreover, targeting LEAP2 and ghrelin in a manner that lowers the plasma LEAP2/ghrelin molar ratio could benefit cognitive performance in elderly individuals for rejuvenation of memory.",2023,Aging; Alzheimer disease; G protein–coupled receptors; Memory; Neuroscience,"Animals; Mice; Cognitive Dysfunction; Ghrelin; Hepcidins; Hippocampus; Receptors, Ghrelin; Humans; Middle Aged; Aging","Tian, J; Guo, L; Wang, T; Jia, K; Swerdlow, RH; Zigman, JM; Du, H"

Targeting apolipoprotein E and N-terminal amyloid β-protein precursor interaction improves cognition and reduces amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's mice.,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) interaction with amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) has garnered attention as the therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Having discovered the apoE antagonist (6KApoEp) that blocks apoE binding to N-terminal APP, we tested the therapeutic potential of 6KApoEp on AD-relevant phenotypes in amyloid β-protein precursor/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice that express each human apoE isoform of apoE2, apoE3, or apoE4 (designated APP/PS1/E2, APP/PS1/E3, or APP/PS1/E4 mice). At 12 months of age, we intraperitoneally administered 6KApoEp (250 μg/kg) or vehicle once daily for 3 months. At 15 months of age, blockage of apoE and N-terminal APP interaction by 6KApoEp treatment improved cognitive impairment in most tests of learning and memory, including novel object recognition and maze tasks in APP/PS1/E2, APP/PS1/E3, and APP/PS1/E4 mice versus each vehicle-treated mouse line and did not alter behavior in nontransgenic littermates. Moreover, 6KApoEp therapy ameliorated brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits and decreased abundance of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in APP/PS1/E2, APP/PS1/E3, and APP/PS1/E4 mice versus each vehicle-treated mouse group. Notably, the highest effect in Aβ-lowering by 6KApoEp treatment was observed in APP/PS1/E4 mice versus APP/PS1/E2 or APP/PS1/E3 mice. These effects occured through shifting toward lessened amyloidogenic APP processing due to decreasing APP abundance at the plasma membrane, reducing APP transcription, and inhibiting p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Our findings provide the preclinical evidence that 6KApoEp therapy aimed at targeting apoE and N-terminal APP interaction is a promising strategy and may be suitable for patients with AD carrying the apoE4 isoform.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid β-protein; amyloid β-protein precursor; apolipoprotein E; isoform; low-density lipoprotein receptor,"Animals; Humans; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Apolipoproteins E; Cognition; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Transgenic; Neuroprotective Agents; Peptide Fragments","Sawmiller, D; Koyama, N; Fujiwara, M; Segawa, T; Maeda, M; Mori, T"
The association between personality and plasma biomarkers of astrogliosis and neuronal injury.,"Personality traits have been associated with the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, including amyloid and tau. This study examines whether personality traits are concurrently related to plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrogliosis, and neurofilament light (NfL), a marker of neuronal injury. Cognitively unimpaired participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (N = 786; age: 22-95) were assayed for plasma GFAP and NfL and completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, which measures 5 domains and 30 facets of personality. Neuroticism (particularly vulnerability to stress, anxiety, and depression) was associated with higher GFAP and NfL. Conscientiousness was associated with lower GFAP. Extraversion (particularly positive emotions, assertiveness, and activity) was related to lower GFAP and NfL. These associations were independent of demographic, behavioral, and health covariates and not moderated by age, sex, or apolipoprotein E genotype. The personality correlates of astrogliosis and neuronal injury tend to be similar, are found in individuals without cognitive impairment, and point to potential neurobiological underpinnings of the association between personality traits and neurodegenerative diseases.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Astrogliosis; Glial fibrillary acidic protein; Neurodegeneration; Neurofilament light; Personality; Plasma biomarkers,"Humans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Gliosis; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Personality; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Terracciano, A; Walker, K; An, Y; Luchetti, M; Stephan, Y; Moghekar, AR; Sutin, AR; Ferrucci, L; Resnick, SM"

Genetic architecture of plasma Alzheimer disease biomarkers.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarker levels have identified novel genes implicated in disease risk, onset and progression. However, lumbar punctures have limited availability and may be perceived as invasive. Blood collection is readily available and well accepted, but it is not clear whether plasma biomarkers will be informative for genetic studies. Here we perform genetic analyses on concentrations of plasma amyloid-β peptides Aβ40 (n = 1,467) and Aβ42 (n = 1,484), Aβ42/40 (n = 1467) total tau (n = 504), tau phosphorylated (p-tau181; n = 1079) and neurofilament light (NfL; n = 2,058). GWAS and gene-based analysis was used to identify single variant and genes associated with plasma levels. Finally, polygenic risk score and summary statistics were used to investigate overlapping genetic architecture between plasma biomarkers, CSF biomarkers and AD risk. We found a total of six genome-wide significant signals. APOE was associated with plasma Aβ42, Aβ42/40, tau, p-tau181 and NfL. We proposed 10 candidate functional genes on the basis of 12 single nucleotide polymorphism-biomarker pairs and brain differential gene expression analysis. We found a significant genetic overlap between CSF and plasma biomarkers. We also demonstrate that it is possible to improve the specificity and sensitivity of these biomarkers, when genetic variants regulating protein levels are included in the model. This current study using plasma biomarker levels as quantitative traits can be critical to identification of novel genes that impact AD and more accurate interpretation of plasma biomarker levels.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Bradley, J; Gorijala, P; Schindler, SE; Sung, YJ; Ances, B; Fernandez, MV; Cruchaga, C"

The innate inflammatory cGAS/STING pathway plays a pivotal role in metabolic dysfunction and is an emerging target of interest in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including AD/ADRD.

Detection and treatment of Alzheimer's disease in its preclinical stage.,"Longitudinal multimodal biomarker studies reveal that the continuum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes a long latent phase, referred to as preclinical AD, which precedes the onset of symptoms by decades. Treatment during the preclinical AD phase offers an optimal opportunity for slowing the progression of disease. However, trial design in this population is complex. In this Review, we discuss the recent advances in accurate plasma measurements, new recruitment approaches, sensitive cognitive instruments and self-reported outcomes that have facilitated the successful launch of multiple phase 3 trials for preclinical AD. The recent success of anti-amyloid immunotherapy trials in symptomatic AD has increased the enthusiasm for testing this strategy at the earliest feasible stage. We provide an outlook for standard screening of amyloid accumulation at the preclinical stage in clinically normal individuals, during which effective therapy to delay or prevent cognitive decline can be initiated.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloidogenic Proteins,"Rafii, MS; Aisen, PS"
Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice and trials.,"Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials. Longitudinal measurements of such biomarkers will also improve the detection of relevant disease-modifying effects of new drugs or lifestyle interventions.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers","Hansson, O; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Dage, J"

Mass spectrometric simultaneous quantification of tau species in plasma shows differential associations with amyloid and tau pathologies.,"Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, at differing sites, demonstrate high accuracy to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, knowledge on the optimal marker for disease identification across the AD continuum and the link to pathology is limited. This is partly due to heterogeneity in analytical methods. In this study, we employed an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry method to simultaneously quantify six phosphorylated (p-tau181, p-tau199, p-tau202, p-tau205, p-tau217 and p-tau231) and two non-phosphorylated plasma tau peptides in a total of 214 participants from the Paris Lariboisière and Translational Biomarkers of Aging and Dementia cohorts. Our results indicate that p-tau217, p-tau231 and p-tau205 are the plasma tau forms that best reflect AD-related brain changes, although with distinct emergences along the disease course and correlations with AD features-amyloid and tau. These findings support the differential association of blood p-tau variants with AD pathology, and our method offers a potential tool for disease staging in clinical trials.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Biomarkers; Brain; tau Proteins,"Montoliu-Gaya, L; Benedet, AL; Tissot, C; Vrillon, A; Ashton, NJ; Brum, WS; Lantero-Rodriguez, J; Stevenson, J; Nilsson, J; Sauer, M; Rahmouni, N; Brinkmalm, G; Lussier, FZ; Pascoal, TA; Skoog, I; Kern, S; Zetterberg, H; Paquet, C; Gobom, J; Rosa-Neto, P; Blennow, K"
Viral-induced neuronal necroptosis: Detrimental to brain function and regulation by necroptosis inhibitors.,"Neuronal necroptosis (programmed necrosis) in the CNS naturally occurs through a caspase-independent way and, especially in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parknson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and viral infections. Understanding necroptosis pathways (death receptor-dependent and independent), and its connections with other cell death pathways could lead to new insights into treatment. Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) mediates necroptosis via mixed-lineage kinase-like (MLKL) proteins. RIPK/MLKL necrosome contains FADD, procaspase-8-cellular FLICE-inhibitory proteins (cFLIPs), RIPK1/RIPK3, and MLKL.

Changes in Plasma Neutral and Ether-Linked Lipids Are Associated with The Pathology and Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Aberrant lipid metabolism has been strongly linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the role of lipids in the pathophysiological processes of AD and their clinical progression is unclear. We hypothesized that plasma lipids are associated with the pathological hallmarks of AD, progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, and the rate of cognitive decline in MCI patients. To evaluate our hypotheses, we analysed the plasma lipidome profile by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in an LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS platform for 213 subjects recruited consecutively: 104 AD, 89 MCI, and 20 control subjects. Forty-seven (52.8%) MCI patients progressed to AD during follow-up (58 ± 12.5 months). We found that higher plasma levels of sphingomyelin SM(36:0) and diglyceride DG(44:3) were associated with an increased risk of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) positivity in CSF, while levels of SM(40:1) were associated with a reduced risk. Higher plasma levels of ether-linked triglyceride TG(O-60:10) were negatively associated with pathological levels of phosphorylated tau in CSF. Plasma levels of fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid FAHFA(34:0) and ether-linked phosphatidylcholine PC(O-36:1) were positively associated with pathological levels of total tau in CSF. Regarding the plasma lipids most associated with progression from MCI to AD, our analysis detected phosphatidyl-ethanolamine plasmalogen PE(P-36:4), TG(59:12), TG(46:0), and TG(O-62:7). Furthermore, TG(O-62:7) was the lipid that was most strongly associated with the rate of progression. In conclusion, our results indicate that neutral and ether-linked lipids are involved in the pathophysiological processes of AD and the progression from MCI to AD dementia, suggesting the involvement of lipid-mediated antioxidant mechanisms in AD.",2023,,,"Dakterzada, F; Jové, M; Huerto, R; Carnes, A; Sol, J; Pamplona, R; Piñol-Ripoll, G"
Inhibition of discoidin domain receptor (DDR)-1 with nilotinib alters CSF miRNAs and is associated with reduced inflammation and vascular fibrosis in Alzheimer's disease.,"Discoidin Domain Receptor (DDR)-1 is activated by collagen. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA-approved for leukemia and potently inhibits DDR-1. Individuals diagnosed with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated with nilotinib (versus placebo) for 12 months showed reduction of amyloid plaque and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid, and attenuation of hippocampal volume loss. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we explored unbiased next generation whole genome miRNA sequencing from AD patients CSF and miRNAs were matched with their corresponding mRNAs using gene ontology. Changes in CSF miRNAs were confirmed via measurement of CSF DDR1 activity and plasma levels of AD biomarkers. Approximately 1050 miRNAs are detected in the CSF but only 17 miRNAs are specifically altered between baseline and 12-month treatment with nilotinib versus placebo. Treatment with nilotinib significantly reduces collagen and DDR1 gene expression (upregulated in AD brain), in association with inhibition of CSF DDR1. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins and chemokines are reduced along with caspase-3 gene expression. Specific genes that indicate vascular fibrosis, e.g., collagen, Transforming Growth Factors (TGFs) and Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteases (TIMPs) are altered by DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib. Specific changes in vesicular transport, including the neurotransmitters dopamine and acetylcholine, and autophagy genes, including ATGs, indicate facilitation of autophagic flux and cellular trafficking. Inhibition of DDR1 with nilotinib may be a safe and effective adjunct treatment strategy involving an oral drug that enters the CNS and adequately engages its target. DDR1 inhibition with nilotinib exhibits multi-modal effects not only on amyloid and tau clearance but also on anti-inflammatory markers that may reduce cerebrovascular fibrosis.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Chemokines; Collagen; Cytokines; Discoidin domain receptor 1; MicroRNAs; Nilotinib,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; MicroRNAs; Discoidin Domain Receptors; Pyrimidines; Collagen; Fibrosis; Inflammation,"Stevenson, M; Varghese, R; Hebron, ML; Liu, X; Ratliff, N; Smith, A; Turner, RS; Moussa, C"

MiR-431 attenuates synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.,"Synaptic plasticity impairment plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRs) are alternative biomarkers and therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in AD. In this study, we found that the level of miR-431 was downregulated in the plasma of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD. In addition, it was decreased in the hippocampus and plasma of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. Lentivirus-mediated miR-431 overexpression in the hippocampus CA1 ameliorated synaptic plasticity and memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice, while it did not affect amyloid-β levels. Smad4 was identified as a target of miR-431, and Smad4 knockdown modulated the expression of synaptic proteins, including SAP102, and protected against synaptic plasticity and memory dysfunctions in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, Smad4 overexpression reversed the protective effects of miR-431, indicating that miR-431 attenuated synaptic impairment at least partially by Smad4 inhibition.

However, imaging cerebral transition metals in vivo can be extremely challenging. As the retina is a known accessible extension of the central nervous system, we examined whether changes in the hippocampus and cortex metal load are also mirrored in the retina.

The Effect of the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter Inhibitor on Cognition and Metabolic Parameters in a Rat Model of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD), and antidiabetic drugs, including the sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLTI), are being studied as possible sAD therapy. We have explored whether the SGLTI phloridzin may influence metabolic and cognitive parameters in a rat model of sAD. Adult male Wistar rats were randomized to a control (CTR), an sAD-model group induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ-icv; 3 mg/kg), a CTR+SGLTI, or an STZ-icv+SGLTI group. Two-month-long oral (gavage) SGLTI treatment (10 mg/kg) was initiated 1 month after STZ-icv and cognitive performance tested prior to sacrifice. SGLTI treatment significantly decreased plasma glucose levels only in the CTR group and failed to correct STZ-icv-induced cognitive deficit. In both the CTR and STZ-icv groups, SGLTI treatment diminished weight gain, decreased amyloid beta (Aβ) 1-42 in duodenum, and decreased the plasma levels of total glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), while the levels of active GLP-1, as well as both total and active glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, remained unchanged, compared to their respective controls. The increment in GLP-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and its effect on Aβ 1-42 in duodenum could be one of the molecular mechanisms by which SGLTIs indirectly induce pleiotropic beneficial effects.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; glucagon-like peptide 1; sodium–glucose cotransporter inhibitor; streptozotocin,,"Osmanović Barilar, J; Babić Perhoč, A; Knezović, A; Homolak, J; Virag, D; Šalković-Petrišić, M"
"Haptoglobin-Related Protein without Signal Peptide as Biomarker of Renal Salt Wasting in Hyponatremia, Hyponatremia-Related Diseases and as New Syndrome in Alzheimer's Disease.","The application of pathophysiologic tenets has created significant changes in our approach to hyponatremia and hyponatremia-related conditions. This new approach incorporated the determination of fractional excretion (FE) of urate before and after the correction of hyponatremia and the response to isotonic saline infusion to differentiate the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) from renal salt wasting (RSW). FEurate simplified the identification of the different causes of hyponatremia, especially the diagnosis of a reset osmostat and Addison's disease. Differentiating SIADH from RSW has been extremely difficult because both syndromes present with identical clinical parameters, which could be overcome by successfully carrying out the difficult protocol of this new approach. A study of 62 hyponatremic patients from the general medical wards of the hospital identified 17 (27%) to have SIADH, 19 (31%) with reset osmostat, and 24 (38%) with RSW with 21 of these RSW patients presenting without clinical evidence of cerebral disease to warrant changing the nomenclature from cerebral to renal salt wasting. The natriuretic activity found in the plasma of 21 and 18 patients with neurosurgical and Alzheimer's disease, respectively, was later identified as haptoglobin-related protein without signal peptide (HPRWSP). The high prevalence of RSW creates a therapeutic dilemma of deciding whether to water-restrict water-logged patients with SIADH as compared to administering saline to volume-depleted patients with RSW. Future studies will hopefully achieve the following: 1. Abandon the ineffective volume approach; 2. Develop HPRWSP as a biomarker to identify hyponatremic and a projected large number of normonatremic patients at risk of developing RSW, including Alzheimer's disease; 3.

"Glymphatic clearance estimated using diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces is reduced after traumatic brain injury and correlates with plasma neurofilament light, a biomarker of injury severity.","The glymphatic system is a perivascular fluid clearance system, most active during sleep, considered important for clearing the brain of waste products and toxins. Glymphatic failure is hypothesized to underlie brain protein deposition in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Preclinical evidence suggests that a functioning glymphatic system is also essential for recovery from traumatic brain injury, which involves release of debris and toxic proteins that need to be cleared from the brain. In a cross-sectional observational study, we estimated glymphatic clearance using diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces, an MRI-derived measure of water diffusivity surrounding veins in the periventricular region, in 13 non-injured controls and 37 subjects who had experienced traumatic brain injury ∼5 months previously. We additionally measured the volume of the perivascular space using ",2023,MRI; clearance; glymphatic; perivascular; traumatic brain injury,,"Butler, T; Zhou, L; Ozsahin, I; Wang, XH; Garetti, J; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Jamison, K; de Leon, MJ; Li, Y; Kuceyeski, A; Shah, SA"

Predictive blood biomarkers and brain changes associated with age-related cognitive decline.,"Growing evidence supports the use of plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, amyloid-β, neurofilament light and glial fibrillary acidic protein as promising biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. While these blood biomarkers are promising for distinguishing people with Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls, their predictive validity for age-related cognitive decline without dementia remains unclear. Further, while tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 is a promising biomarker, the distribution of this phospho-epitope of tau in the brain is unknown. Here, we tested whether plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, amyloid-β, neurofilament light and fibrillary acidic protein predict cognitive decline between ages 72 and 82 in 195 participants in the Lothian birth cohorts 1936 study of cognitive ageing. We further examined post-mortem brain samples from temporal cortex to determine the distribution of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 in the brain. Several forms of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 have been shown to contribute to synapse degeneration in Alzheimer's disease, which correlates closely with cognitive decline in this form of dementia, but to date, there have not been investigations of whether tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 is found in synapses in Alzheimer's disease or healthy ageing brain. It was also previously unclear whether tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 accumulated in dystrophic neurites around plaques, which could contribute to tau leakage to the periphery due to impaired membrane integrity in dystrophies. Brain homogenate and biochemically enriched synaptic fractions were examined with western blot to examine tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 levels between groups (",2023,array tomography; cognition; cognitive ageing; plasma biomarkers; western blotting,,"Saunders, TS; Pozzolo, FE; Heslegrave, A; King, D; McGeachan, RI; Spires-Jones, MP; Harris, SE; Ritchie, C; Muniz-Terrera, G; Deary, IJ; Cox, SR; Zetterberg, H; Spires-Jones, TL"

The cross-sectional association between amyloid burden and white matter hyperintensities in older adults without cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins into plaques. Individuals with AD frequently show mixed pathologies, often caused by cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), resulting in lesions such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH). The current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the cross-sectional relationship between amyloid burden and WMH in older adults without objective cognitive impairment. A systematic search performed in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO yielded 13 eligible studies. Aβ was assessed using PET, CSF, or plasma measurements. Two meta-analyses were performed: one on Cohen's d metrics and one on correlation coefficients. The meta-analyses revealed an overall weighted small-to-medium Cohen's d of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.31-0.78) in CSF, an overall correlation of 0.31 (0.09-0.50) in CSF, and a large Cohen's d of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.66-1.27) in PET. Only two studies assessed this relationship in plasma, with an effect size of - 0.20 (95% CI: -0.75 to 0.34). These findings indicate a relationship between both amyloid and vascular pathologies in cognitively normal adults in PET and CSF. Future studies should assess the possible relationship of blood amyloid-beta and WMH for broader identification of at risk individuals showing mixed pathology in preclinical stages.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Amyloid; Dementia; White matter hyperintensities,Humans; Aged; White Matter; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Twait, EL; Min, B; Beran, M; Vonk, JMJ; Geerlings, MI"
Mechano-Chemistry across Phase Transitions in Heated Albumin Protein Solutions.,"The presence of certain proteins in biofluids such as synovial fluid, blood plasma, and saliva gives these fluids non-Newtonian viscoelastic properties. The amount of these protein macromolecules in biofluids is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of various health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disorders, and joint quality. However, existing technologies for measuring the behavior of macromolecules in biofluids have limitations, such as long turnaround times, complex protocols, and insufficient sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose non-contact, optical Brillouin and Raman spectroscopy to assess the viscoelasticity and chemistry of non-Newtonian solutions, respectively, at different temperatures in several minutes. In this work, bovine and human serum albumin solution-based biopolymers were studied to obtain both their collective dynamics and molecular chemical evolution across heat-driven phase transitions at various protein concentrations. The observed phase transitions at elevated temperatures could be fully delayed in heated biopolymers by appropriately raising the level of protein concentration. The non-contact optical monitoring of viscoelastic and chemical property evolution could represent novel potential mechano-chemical biomarkers for disease diagnosis and subsequent treatment applications, including hyperthermia.",2023,Brillouin scattering; Raman scattering; albumin; denaturation; gelation; heating; mechano-chemical; phase transitions; polymer; protein; viscoelastic,,"Kharmyssov, C; Sekerbayev, K; Nurekeyev, Z; Gaipov, A; Utegulov, ZN"
The Effects of Methylfolate on Cognitive Decline and Dementia: A Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Dementia and cognitive decline are highly prevalent in later life and are growing public health concerns worldwide due to the increasing aging population. Individuals diagnosed with dementia have reduced mental function, resulting in social and cognitive skill deficits, increased dependence, and reduced autonomy-all of which are conditions associated with higher mortality rates. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of treating dementia and cognitive decline with methylfolate.

Blood-Based Proteomic Profiling Identifies Potential Biomarker Candidates and Pathogenic Pathways in Dementia.,"Dementia is a progressive and debilitating neurological disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Identifying the minimally invasive biomarkers associated with dementia that could provide insights into the disease pathogenesis, improve early diagnosis, and facilitate the development of effective treatments is pressing. Proteomic studies have emerged as a promising approach for identifying the protein biomarkers associated with dementia. This pilot study aimed to investigate the plasma proteome profile and identify a panel of various protein biomarkers for dementia. We used a high-throughput proximity extension immunoassay to quantify 1090 proteins in 122 participants (22 with dementia, 64 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 36 controls with normal cognitive function). Limma-based differential expression analysis reported the dysregulation of 61 proteins in the plasma of those with dementia compared with controls, and machine learning algorithms identified 17 stable diagnostic biomarkers that differentiated individuals with AUC = 0.98 ± 0.02. There was also the dysregulation of 153 plasma proteins in individuals with dementia compared with those with MCI, and machine learning algorithms identified 8 biomarkers that classified dementia from MCI with an AUC of 0.87 ± 0.07. Moreover, multiple proteins selected in both diagnostic panels such as NEFL, IL17D, WNT9A, and PGF were negatively correlated with cognitive performance, with a correlation coefficient (r",2023,MCI; Olink assay; biomarkers; dementia; machine learning; plasma proteomics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Proteomics; Pilot Projects; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Ehtewish, H; Mesleh, A; Ponirakis, G; De la Fuente, A; Parray, A; Bensmail, I; Abdesselem, H; Ramadan, M; Khan, S; Chandran, M; Ayadathil, R; Elsotouhy, A; Own, A; Al Hamad, H; Abdelalim, EM; Decock, J; Alajez, NM; Albagha, O; Thornalley, PJ; Arredouani, A; Malik, RA; El-Agnaf, OMA"

Senolytic therapy to modulate the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (SToMP-AD) - Outcomes from the first clinical trial of senolytic therapy for Alzheimer's disease.,"Cellular senescence has been identified as a pathological mechanism linked to tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clearance of senescent cells using the senolytic compounds dasatinib (D) and quercetin (Q) reduced neuropathological burden and improved clinically relevant outcomes in the mice. Herein, we conducted a vanguard open-label clinical trial of senolytic therapy for AD with the primary aim of evaluating central nervous system (CNS) penetrance, as well as exploratory data collection relevant to safety, feasibility, and efficacy. Participants with early-stage symptomatic AD were enrolled in an open-label, 12-week pilot study of intermittent orally-delivered D+Q. CNS penetrance was assessed by evaluating drug levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Safety was continuously monitored with adverse event reporting, vitals, and laboratory work. Cognition, neuroimaging, and plasma and CSF biomarkers were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. Five participants (mean age: 76±5 years; 40% female) completed the trial. The treatment increased D and Q levels in the blood of all participants ranging from 12.7 to 73.5 ng/ml for D and 3.29-26.30 ng/ml for Q. D levels were detected in the CSF of four participants ranging from 0.281 to 0.536 ng/ml (t(4)=3.123, p=0.035); Q was not detected. Treatment was well-tolerated with no early discontinuation and six mild to moderate adverse events occurring across the study. Cognitive and neuroimaging endpoints did not significantly differ from baseline to post-treatment. CNS levels of IL-6 and GFAP increased from baseline to post-treatment (t(4)=3.913, p=008 and t(4)=3.354, p=0.028, respectively) concomitant with decreased levels of several cytokines and chemokines associated with senescence, and a trend toward higher levels of Aβ42 (t(4)=-2.338, p=0.079). Collectively the data indicate the CNS penetrance of D and provide preliminary support for the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of the intervention and suggest that astrocytes and Aβ may be particularly responsive to the treatment.

Inhibition of ACAT as a Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease Is Independent of ApoE4 Lipidation.,"APOE4, encoding apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), compared to the common APOE3. While the mechanism(s) underlying APOE4-induced AD risk remains unclear, increasing the lipidation of apoE4 is an important therapeutic target as apoE4-lipoproteins are poorly lipidated compared to apoE3-lipoproteins. ACAT (acyl-CoA: cholesterol-acyltransferase) catalyzes the formation of intracellular cholesteryl-ester droplets, reducing the intracellular free cholesterol (FC) pool. Thus, inhibiting ACAT increases the FC pool and facilitates lipid secretion to extracellular apoE-containing lipoproteins. Previous studies using commercial ACAT inhibitors, including avasimibe (AVAS), as well as ACAT-knock out (KO) mice, exhibit reduced AD-like pathology and amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in familial AD (FAD)-transgenic (Tg) mice. However, the effects of AVAS with human apoE4 remain unknown. In vitro, AVAS induced apoE efflux at concentrations of AVAS measured in the brains of treated mice.

Age-dependent differences and similarities in the plasma proteomic signature of postoperative delirium.,"Delirium is an acute confusional state and a common postoperative morbidity. Prevalent in older adults, delirium occurs at other ages but it is unclear whether the pathophysiology and biomarkers for the condition are independent of age. We quantified expression of 273 plasma proteins involved in inflammation and cardiovascular or neurologic conditions in 34 middle-aged and 42 older patients before and one day after elective spine surgery. Delirium was identified by the 3D-CAM and comprehensive chart review. Protein expression was measure by Proximity Extension Assay and results were analyzed by logistic regression, gene set enrichment, and protein-protein interactions. Twenty-two patients developed delirium postoperatively (14 older; 8 middle-aged) and 89 proteins in pre- or 1-day postoperative plasma were associated with delirium. A few proteins (IL-8, LTBR, TNF-R2 postoperatively; IL-8, IL-6, LIF, ASGR1 by pre- to postoperative change) and 12 networks were common to delirium in both age groups. However, there were marked differences in the delirium proteome by age; older patients had many more delirium-associated proteins and pathways than middle-aged subjects even though both had the same clinical syndrome. Therefore, there are age-dependent similarities and differences in the plasma proteomic signature of postoperative delirium, which may signify age differences in pathogenesis of the syndrome.",2023,,Middle Aged; Humans; Aged; Emergence Delirium; Proteomics; Interleukin-8; Postoperative Complications; Delirium; Asialoglycoprotein Receptor,"Oren, RL; Kim, EJ; Leonard, AK; Rosner, B; Chibnik, LB; Das, S; Grodstein, F; Crosby, G; Culley, DJ"
Enlarged perivascular spaces and plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in older adults without dementia.,"Dilation of perivascular spaces (PVS) in the brain may indicate poor fluid drainage due to the accumulation of perivascular cell debris, waste, and proteins, including amyloid-beta (Aβ).

Independently living older adults (N = 56, mean age = 68.2 years; Standard deviation (SD) = 6.5; 30.4% male) free of dementia or clinical stroke were recruited from the community and underwent brain MRI and venipuncture. PVS were qualitatively scored and dichotomized to low PVS burden (scores 0-1,) or high PVS burden (score>1). Plasma was assayed using a Quanterix Simoa Kit to quantify Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels.

Microglial P2X4 receptors promote ApoE degradation and contribute to memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.,"Numerous evidences support that microglia contributes to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. P2X4 receptors are ATP-gated channels with high calcium permeability, which are de novo expressed in a subset of reactive microglia associated with various pathological contexts, contributing to microglial functions. P2X4 receptors are mainly localized in lysosomes and trafficking to the plasma membrane is tightly regulated. Here, we investigated the role of P2X4 in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using proteomics, we identified Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) as a specific P2X4 interacting protein.

Fluid and Biopsy Based Biomarkers in Parkinson's Disease.,"Several advances in fluid and tissue-based biomarkers for use in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies have been made in the last several years.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathology is commonly found postmortem in PD, especially in those who develop dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Biofluid biomarkers for tau and amyloid beta species can detect AD co-pathology in PD and DLB, which does have relevance for prognosis, but further work is needed to understand the interplay of aSyn tau, amyloid beta, and other pathological changes to generate comprehensive biomarker profiles for patients in a manner translatable to clinical trial design and individualized therapies.",2023,Alpha-synuclein; Biopsy; Immunofluorescence; Parkinson’s disease; Protein misfolding cyclic amplification; Real-time quaking induced conversion,Humans; Parkinson Disease; alpha-Synuclein; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Biopsy; Biomarkers,"Coughlin, DG; Irwin, DJ"

Butyrylcholinesterase in lipid metabolism: A new outlook.,"Cholinesterase enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are traditionally associated with the termination of acetylcholine mediated neural signaling. The fact that these ubiquitous enzymes are also found in tissues not involved in neurotransmission has led to search for alternative functions for these enzymes. Cholinesterases are reported to be involved in many lipid related disease states. Taking into view that lipases and cholinesterases belong to the same enzyme class and by comparing the catalytic sites, we propose a new outlook on the link between BChE and lipid metabolism. The lipogenic substrates of BChE that have recently emerged in contrast to traditional cholinesterase substrates are explained through the hydrolytic capacity of BChE for ghrelin, 4-methyumbelliferyl (4-mu) palmitate, and arachidonoylcholine and through endogenous lipid mediators such as cannabinoids like anandamide and essential fatty acids. The abundance of BChE in brain, intestine, liver, and plasma, tissues with active lipid metabolism, supports the idea that BChE may be involved in lipid hydrolysis. BChE is also regulated by various lipids such as linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid or dioctanoylglycerol, whereas AChE is inhibited. The finding that BChE is able to hydrolyze 4-mu palmitate at a pH where lipases are less efficient points to its role as a backup in lipolysis. In diseases such as Alzheimer, in which elevated BChE and impaired lipid levels are observed, the lipolytic activity of BChE might be involved. It is possible to suggest that fatty acids such as 4-mu palmitate, ghrelin, arachidonoylcholine, essential fatty acids, and other related lipid mediators regulate cholinesterases, which could lead to some sort of compensatory mechanism at high lipid concentrations.",2024,butyrylcholinesterase; endogenous lipid modulators; essential fatty acids; lipid hydrolysis; lipid metabolism; palmitate,Acetylcholinesterase; Butyrylcholinesterase; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Fatty Acids; Ghrelin; Linoleic Acid; Lipid Metabolism; Palmitates,"Gok, M; Cicek, C; Bodur, E"
APP and Bace1: Differential effect of cholesterol enrichment on processing and plasma membrane mobility.,"High cholesterol levels are a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease. Experiments investigating the influence of cholesterol on the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β-secretase Bace1 and on their proximity in cells have led to conflicting results. By using a fluorescence bioassay coupled with flow cytometry we found a direct correlation between the increase in membrane cholesterol amount and the degree of APP shedding in living human neuroblastoma cells. Analogue results were obtained for cells overexpressing an APP mutant that cannot be processed by α-secretase, highlighting the major influence of cholesterol enrichment on the cleavage of APP carried out by Bace1.

An important role in this process is played by vascular disorders, in particular, a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB controls the entry of Aβ from plasma to the brain via the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and the removal of brain-derived Aβ via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1). The balance between the input of Aβ to the brain from the periphery and its output is disturbed during AD. Aβ changes the redox-status of BBB cells, which in turn changes the functioning of mitochondria and disrupts the barrier function of endothelial cells by affecting tight junction proteins. Aβ oligomers have the greatest toxic effect on BBB cells, and oligomers are most rapidly transferred by transcytosis from the brain side of the BBB to the blood side. Both the cytotoxic effect of Aβ and the impairment of barrier function are partly due to the interaction of Aβ monomers and oligomers with membrane-bound RAGE. AD therapies based on the disruption of this interaction or the creation of decoys for Aβ are being developed. The question of the transfer of various Aβ isoforms through the BBB is important, since it can influence the development of AD. It is shown that the rate of input of Aβ",2023,Beta-amyloid; Blood-brain barrier; LRP1; Mitochondria; RAGE; Redox status,,"Petrushanko, IY; Mitkevich, VA; Makarov, AA"
Sex differences in the progression of glucose metabolism dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid plaques and impaired brain metabolism. Because women have a higher prevalence of AD than men, sex differences are of great interest. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal data, we showed sex-dependent metabolic dysregulations in the brains of AD patients. Cohort 1 (South Korean, n = 181) underwent Pittsburgh compound B-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood biomarker (plasma tau and beta-amyloid 42 and 40) measurements at baseline and two-year follow-ups. Transcriptome analysis of data from Cohorts 2 and 3 (European, n = 78; Singaporean, n = 18) revealed sex differences in AD-related alterations in brain metabolism. In women (but not in men), all imaging indicators displayed consistent correlation curves with AD progression. At the two-year follow-up, clear brain metabolic impairment was revealed only in women, and the plasma beta-amyloid 42/40 ratio was a possible biomarker for brain metabolism in women. Furthermore, our transcriptome analysis revealed sex differences in transcriptomes and metabolism in the brains of AD patients as well as a molecular network of 25 female-specific glucose metabolic genes (FGGs). We discovered four key-attractor FGG genes (ALDOA, ENO2, PRKACB, and PPP2R5D) that were associated with amyloid/tau-related genes (APP, MAPT, BACE1, and BACE2). Furthermore, these genes successfully distinguished amyloid positivity in women. Understanding sex differences in the pathogenesis of AD and considering these differences will improve development of effective diagnostics and therapeutic treatments for AD.",2023,,Humans; Female; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Sex Characteristics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Biomarkers; Amyloid; Glucose; Disease Progression; Protein Phosphatase 2,"Park, JC; Lim, H; Byun, MS; Yi, D; Byeon, G; Jung, G; Kim, YK; Lee, DY; Han, SH; Mook-Jung, I"
Protective Alzheimer's disease-associated APP A673T variant predominantly decreases sAPPβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid and 2D/3D cell culture models.,"The rare A673T variant was the first variant found within the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene conferring protection against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thereafter, different studies have discovered that the carriers of the APP A673T variant show reduced levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the plasma and better cognitive performance at high age. Here, we analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of APP A673T carriers and control individuals using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify differentially regulated targets in an unbiased manner. Furthermore, the APP A673T variant was introduced into 2D and 3D neuronal cell culture models together with the pathogenic APP Swedish and London mutations. Consequently, we now report for the first time the protective effects of the APP A673T variant against AD-related alterations in the CSF, plasma, and brain biopsy samples from the frontal cortex. The CSF levels of soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) and Aβ42 were significantly decreased on average 9-26% among three APP A673T carriers as compared to three well-matched controls not carrying the protective variant. Consistent with these CSF findings, immunohistochemical assessment of cortical biopsy samples from the same APP A673T carriers did not reveal Aβ, phospho-tau, or p62 pathologies. We identified differentially regulated targets involved in protein phosphorylation, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in the CSF and plasma samples of APP A673T carriers. Some of the identified targets showed inverse levels in AD brain tissue with respect to increased AD-associated neurofibrillary pathology. In 2D and 3D neuronal cell culture models expressing APP with the Swedish and London mutations, the introduction of the APP A673T variant resulted in lower sAPPβ levels. Concomitantly, the levels of sAPPα were increased, while decreased levels of CTFβ and Aβ42 were detected in some of these models. Our findings emphasize the important role of APP-derived peptides in the pathogenesis of AD and demonstrate the effectiveness of the protective APP A673T variant to shift APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway in vitro even in the presence of two pathogenic mutations.",2023,2D/3D cell models; APP A673T variant; Alzheimer's disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Protective mechanisms,Humans; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Heterozygote; Brain,"Wittrahm, R; Takalo, M; Kuulasmaa, T; Mäkinen, PM; Mäkinen, P; Končarević, S; Fartzdinov, V; Selzer, S; Kokkola, T; Antikainen, L; Martiskainen, H; Kemppainen, S; Marttinen, M; Jeskanen, H; Rostalski, H; Rahunen, E; Kivipelto, M; Ngandu, T; Natunen, T; Lambert, JC; Tanzi, RE; Kim, DY; Rauramaa, T; Herukka, SK; Soininen, H; Laakso, M; Pike, I; Leinonen, V; Haapasalo, A; Hiltunen, M"

CSF tau phosphorylation occupancies at T217 and T205 represent improved biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)42/Aβ40 and the concentration of tau phosphorylated at site 181 (p-tau181) are well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study used mass spectrometry to measure concentrations of nine phosphorylated and five nonphosphorylated tau species and phosphorylation occupancies (percentage phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated) at ten sites. In the present study we show that, in 750 individuals with a median age of 71.2 years, CSF pT217/T217 predicted the presence of brain amyloid by positron emission tomography (PET) slightly better than Aβ42/Aβ40 (P = 0.02). Furthermore, for individuals with positive brain amyloid by PET (n = 263), CSF pT217/T217 was more strongly correlated with the amount of amyloid (Spearman's ρ = 0.69) than Aβ42/Aβ40 (ρ = -0.42, P < 0.0001). In two independent cohorts of participants with symptoms of AD dementia (n = 55 and n = 90), CSF pT217/T217 and pT205/T205 were better correlated with tau PET measures than CSF p-tau181 concentration. These findings suggest that CSF pT217/T217 and pT205/T205 represent improved CSF biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in AD.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Phosphorylation; Peptide Fragments; Amyloid; Biomarkers,"Barthélemy, NR; Saef, B; Li, Y; Gordon, BA; He, Y; Horie, K; Stomrud, E; Salvadó, G; Janelidze, S; Sato, C; Ovod, V; Henson, RL; Fagan, AM; Benzinger, TLS; Xiong, C; Morris, JC; Hansson, O; Bateman, RJ; Schindler, SE"

CAA is associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of small vessel disease (SVD). Since Aβ is also accumulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the brain parenchyma, we aimed to study if several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with AD were also associated with CAA pathology.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Metabolomics: Pilot Study of Using Metabolomics to Assess Diet and Metabolic Interventions in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Brain glucose hypometabolism is an early sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and interventions which offset this deficit, such as ketogenic diets, show promise as AD therapeutics. Conversely, high-fat feeding may exacerbate AD risk. We analyzed the metabolomic profile of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a pilot study of older adults who underwent saline and triglyceride (TG) infusions. Older adults (12 cognitively normal (CN), age 65.3 ± 8.1, and 9 with cognitive impairment (CI), age 70.9 ± 8.6) underwent a 5 h TG or saline infusion on different days using a random crossover design; CSF was collected at the end of infusion. Aqueous metabolites were measured using a targeted mass spectroscopy (MS) platform focusing on 215 metabolites from over 35 different metabolic pathways. Data were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 and SAS. Of the 215 targeted metabolites, 99 were detectable in CSF. Only one metabolite significantly differed by treatment: the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (HBA). Post hoc analyses showed that HBA levels were associated with age and markers of metabolic syndrome and demonstrated different correlation patterns for the two treatments. When analyzed by cognitive diagnosis group, TG-induced increases in HBA were over 3 times higher for those with cognitive impairment (change score CN +9.8 uM ± 8.3, CI +32.4 ± 7.4, ",2023,Alzheimer’s; blood brain barrier; cerebrospinal fluid; ketone bodies; metabolomics,,"Hanson, AJ; Banks, WA; Bettcher, LF; Pepin, R; Raftery, D; Navarro, SL; Craft, S"

Vascular Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease: Alterations in the Plasma Contact and Fibrinolytic Systems.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting millions of people worldwide. The classical hallmarks of AD include extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, although they are often accompanied by various vascular defects. These changes include damage to the vasculature, a decrease in cerebral blood flow, and accumulation of Aβ along vessels, among others. Vascular dysfunction begins early in disease pathogenesis and may contribute to disease progression and cognitive dysfunction. In addition, patients with AD exhibit alterations in the plasma contact system and the fibrinolytic system, two pathways in the blood that regulate clotting and inflammation. Here, we explain the clinical manifestations of vascular deficits in AD. Further, we describe how changes in plasma contact activation and the fibrinolytic system may contribute to vascular dysfunction, inflammation, coagulation, and cognitive impairment in AD. Given this evidence, we propose novel therapies that may, alone or in combination, ameliorate AD progression in patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; beta-amyloid; contact system; fibrinogen; vasculature,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Inflammation,"Badimon, A; Torrente, D; Norris, EH"

Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and risk variant carriers.,"Genetic studies of Alzheimer disease (AD) have prioritized variants in genes related to the amyloid cascade, lipid metabolism, and neuroimmune modulation. However, the cell-specific effect of variants in these genes is not fully understood. Here, we perform single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on nearly 300,000 nuclei from the parietal cortex of AD autosomal dominant (APP and PSEN1) and risk-modifying variant (APOE, TREM2 and MS4A) carriers. Within individual cell types, we capture genes commonly dysregulated across variant groups. However, specific transcriptional states are more prevalent within variant carriers. TREM2 oligodendrocytes show a dysregulated autophagy-lysosomal pathway, MS4A microglia have dysregulated complement cascade genes, and APOEε4 inhibitory neurons display signs of ferroptosis. All cell types have enriched states in autosomal dominant carriers. We leverage differential expression and single-nucleus ATAC-seq to map GWAS signals to effector cell types including the NCK2 signal to neurons in addition to the initially proposed microglia.

Apolipoprotein E O-glycosylation is associated with amyloid plaques and APOE genotype.,"Although the APOE ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), the relationship between apolipoprotein (apoE) and AD pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Relatively little is known about the apoE protein species, including post-translational modifications, that exist in the human periphery and CNS. To better understand these apoE species, we developed a LC-MS/MS assay that simultaneously quantifies both unmodified and O-glycosylated apoE peptides. The study cohort included 47 older individuals (age 75.6 ± 5.7 years [mean ± standard deviation]), including 23 individuals (49%) with cognitive impairment. Paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples underwent analysis. We quantified O-glycosylation of two apoE protein residues - one in the hinge region and one in the C-terminal region - and found that glycosylation occupancy of the hinge region in the plasma was significantly correlated with plasma total apoE levels, APOE genotype and amyloid status as determined by CSF Aβ42/Aβ40. A model with plasma glycosylation occupancy, plasma total apoE concentration, and APOE genotype distinguished amyloid status with an AUROC of 0.89.

Characterization of Pairs of Toxic and Nontoxic Misfolded Protein Oligomers Elucidates the Structural Determinants of Oligomer Toxicity in Protein Misfolding Diseases.,"The aberrant misfolding and aggregation of peptides and proteins into amyloid aggregates occurs in over 50 largely incurable protein misfolding diseases. These pathologies include Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, which are global medical emergencies owing to their prevalence in increasingly aging populations worldwide. Although the presence of mature amyloid aggregates is a hallmark of such neurodegenerative diseases, misfolded protein oligomers are increasingly recognized as of central importance in the pathogenesis of many of these maladies. These oligomers are small, diffusible species that can form as intermediates in the amyloid fibril formation process or be released by mature fibrils after they are formed. They have been closely associated with the induction of neuronal dysfunction and cell death. It has proven rather challenging to study these oligomeric species because of their short lifetimes, low concentrations, extensive structural heterogeneity, and challenges associated with producing stable, homogeneous, and reproducible populations. Despite these difficulties, investigators have developed protocols to produce kinetically, chemically, or structurally stabilized homogeneous populations of protein misfolded oligomers from several amyloidogenic peptides and proteins at experimentally ameneable concentrations. Furthermore, procedures have been established to produce morphologically similar but structurally distinct oligomers from the same protein sequence that are either toxic or nontoxic to cells. These tools offer unique opportunities to identify and investigate the structural determinants of oligomer toxicity by a close comparative inspection of their structures and the mechanisms of action through which they cause cell dysfunction.This Account reviews multidisciplinary results, including from our own groups, obtained by combining chemistry, physics, biochemistry, cell biology, and animal models for pairs of toxic and nontoxic oligomers. We describe oligomers comprised of the amyloid-β peptide, which underlie Alzheimer's disease, and α-synuclein, which are associated with Parkinson's disease and other related neurodegenerative pathologies, collectively known as synucleinopathies.

Biological brain age prediction using machine learning on structural neuroimaging data: Multi-cohort validation against biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration stratified by sex.,"Brain-age can be inferred from structural neuroimaging and compared to chronological age (brain-age delta) as a marker of biological brain aging. Accelerated aging has been found in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its validation against markers of neurodegeneration and AD is lacking. Here, imaging-derived measures from the UK Biobank dataset (N=22,661) were used to predict brain-age in 2,314 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals at higher risk of AD and mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients from four independent cohorts with available biomarker data: ALFA+, ADNI, EPAD, and OASIS.

Association of biological sex with clinical outcomes and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.,"The study of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease is increasingly recognized as a key priority in research and clinical development. People with Down syndrome represent the largest population with a genetic link to Alzheimer's disease (>90% in the 7th decade). Yet, sex differences in Alzheimer's disease manifestations have not been fully investigated in these individuals, who are key candidates for preventive clinical trials. In this double-centre, cross-sectional study of 628 adults with Down syndrome [46% female, 44.4 (34.6; 50.7) years], we compared Alzheimer's disease prevalence, as well as cognitive outcomes and AT(N) biomarkers across age and sex. Participants were recruited from a population-based health plan in Barcelona, Spain, and from a convenience sample recruited via services for people with intellectual disabilities in England and Scotland. They underwent assessment with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome, modified cued recall test and determinations of brain amyloidosis (CSF amyloid-β 42 / 40 and amyloid-PET), tau pathology (CSF and plasma phosphorylated-tau181) and neurodegeneration biomarkers (CSF and plasma neurofilament light, total-tau, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and MRI). We used within-group locally estimated scatterplot smoothing models to compare the trajectory of biomarker changes with age in females versus males, as well as by apolipoprotein ɛ4 carriership. Our work revealed similar prevalence, age at diagnosis and Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome scores by sex, but males showed lower modified cued recall test scores from age 45 compared with females. AT(N) biomarkers were comparable in males and females. When considering apolipoprotein ɛ4, female ɛ4 carriers showed a 3-year earlier age at diagnosis compared with female non-carriers (50.5 versus 53.2 years, ",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Down syndrome; gender; precision medicine; sex,,"Iulita, MF; Bejanin, A; Vilaplana, E; Carmona-Iragui, M; Benejam, B; Videla, L; Barroeta, I; Fernández, S; Altuna, M; Pegueroles, J; Montal, V; Valldeneu, S; Giménez, S; González-Ortiz, S; Torres, S; El Bounasri El Bennadi, S; Padilla, C; Rozalem Aranha, M; Estellés, T; Illán-Gala, I; Belbin, O; Valle-Tamayo, N; Camacho, V; Blessing, E; Osorio, RS; Videla, S; Lehmann, S; Holland, AJ; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Alcolea, D; Clarimón, J; Zaman, SH; Blesa, R; Lleó, A; Fortea, J"

A quantitative analysis method for a new glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor and its pharmacokinetics in rats.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), as a chronic and frequent neurodegenerative disease in the elderly population, has caused a huge economic burden to society, family, and other aspects. (E)-N-(4-(((2-amino-5-phenylpyridin-3-yl) imino) methyl) pyridine-2-yl) cyclopropanecarboxamide (PIMPC), a new glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor, has been designed and synthesized as a potential anti-AD compound with antioxidant and metal chelating properties. In this study, we established an HPLC method for the determination of PIMPC, which has high accuracy, good sensitivity, and repeatability. This method determined the PIMPC content in rat plasma at different time points after intragastric administration to understand the pharmacokinetics (PK) process of PIMPC in rats. In addition, we preliminarily evaluated the effect of PIMPC on the liver and kidney in rats at pharmacodynamic doses. In conclusion, we have established a quantitative analysis method for PIMPC with excellent performance. And the PK process of PIMPC in rats, which was characterized by fast absorption, rapid distribution, and rapid elimination, conformed to the characteristics of the two-compartment model. In addition, long-term administration of PIMPC at therapeutic doses would not affect liver and kidney function. These studies have a certain reference for the development and research of PIMPC as a potential anti-AD drug.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; HPLC; glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor; pharmacokinetics,Aged; Rats; Humans; Animals; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease,"Wu, D; Bai, X; Yu, J; Guo, L; Zhao, Y; Liu, P"
Non-Ceruloplasmin Copper Identifies a Subtype of Alzheimer's Disease (CuAD): Characterization of the Cognitive Profile and Case of a CuAD Patient Carrying an ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia whose cause is incompletely defined. Copper (Cu) involvement in AD etiology was confirmed by a meta-analysis on about 6000 participants, showing that Cu levels were decreased in AD brain specimens, while Cu and non-bound ceruloplasmin Cu (non-Cp Cu) levels were increased in serum/plasma samples. Non-Cp Cu was advocated as a stratification add-on biomarker of a Cu subtype of AD (CuAD subtype). To further circumstantiate this concept, we evaluated non-Cp Cu reliability in classifying subtypes of AD based on the characterization of the cognitive profile. The stratification of the AD patients into normal AD (non-Cp Cu ≤ 1.6 µmol/L) and CuAD (non-Cp Cu > 1.6 µmol/L) showed a significant difference in executive function outcomes, even though patients did not differ in disease duration and severity. Among the Cu-AD patients, a 76-year-old woman showed significantly abnormal levels in the Cu panel and underwent whole exome sequencing.

IL-6 Enhances the Negative Impact of Cortisol on Cognition among Community-Dwelling Older People without Dementia.,"There is growing evidence that high basal cortisol levels and systemic inflammation independently contribute to cognitive decline among older people without dementia.

Plasma neurodegeneration biomarker concentrations associate with glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic measures in neurological disorders.,"Clearance of neurotoxic brain proteins via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to blood has recently emerged to be crucial, and plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration were newly introduced to predict neurological disease. This study examines in 106 individuals with neurological disorders associations between plasma biomarkers [40 and 42 amino acid-long amyloid-β (Aβ40 and Aβ42), total-tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL)] and magnetic resonance imaging measures of CSF-mediated clearance from brain via extra-vascular pathways (proxy of glymphatic function) and CSF-to-blood clearance variables from pharmacokinetic modeling (proxy of meningeal lymphatic egress). We also examine how biomarkers vary during daytime and associate with subjective sleep quality. Plasma concentrations of neurodegeneration markers associate with indices of glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic functions in individual- and disease-specific manners, vary during daytime, but are unaffected by sleep quality.

Impaired glucose metabolism reduces glucose flux through the hexosamine metabolic pathway triggering attenuated O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) protein modification.

"Plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 in discriminating PART, AD and other key neuropathologies in older adults.","We examined whether plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 are specific biomarkers of pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, we investigated the utility of plasma p-tau for differentiating AD from primary age-related tauopathy (PART), as well as AD with mixed pathologies. Data came from 269 older adults who participated in the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Blood samples were collected during annual clinical evaluations. Participants died and underwent brain autopsy. P-tau181 and p-tau217 were quantified in the plasma samples proximate to death (average interval before death: 1.4 years) using Lilly-developed MSD immunoassays. Uniform neuropathologic evaluations assessed AD, PART, and other common degenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. Plasma p-tau217 was more strongly correlated with brain β-amyloid and paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) tangles than p-tau181. Both p-tau markers were associated with greater odds of AD, but p-tau217 had higher accuracy (area under the ROC curve (AUC): 0.83) than p-tau181 (AUC: 0.76). Plasma p-tau markers were almost exclusively associated with AD pathologic indices with the exception of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Compared to p-tau181, p-tau217 showed a higher AUC (0.82 versus 0.74) in differentiating AD from PART. For either p-tau, we did not observe a level difference between individuals with AD alone and those with mixed AD pathologies. In summary, plasma p-tau181and p-tau217 were specifically associated with AD pathological changes. Further, our data provide initial evidence that p-tau217 may be able to differentiate between AD and PART in individuals with comparable burdens of tau tangle pathology. These results demonstrate the specificity of p-tau217 for AD, supporting its use to identify patients suitable for anti-AD therapies including β-amyloid immunotherapies.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Mixed pathologies; PART; Plasma p-tau217; p-tau181,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Brain; Aging; Biomarkers,"Yu, L; Boyle, PA; Janelidze, S; Petyuk, VA; Wang, T; Bennett, DA; Hansson, O; Schneider, JA"
A tailored tetravalent peptide displays dual functions to inhibit amyloid β production and aggregation.,"Inhibition of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is a promising approach for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is produced by β-secretase and γ-secretase in endosomes via sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Aβ and APP have a common feature to readily cluster to form multimers. Here, using multivalent peptide library screens, we identified a tetravalent peptide, LME-tet, which binds APP and Aβ via multivalent interactions. In cells, LME-tet-bound APP in the plasma membrane is transported to endosomes, blocking Aβ production through specific inhibition of β-cleavage, but not γ-cleavage. LME-tet further suppresses Aβ aggregation by blocking formation of the β-sheet conformation. Inhibitory effects are not observed with a monomeric peptide, emphasizing the significance of multivalent interactions for mediating these activities. Critically, LME-tet efficiently reduces Aβ levels in the brain of AD model mice, suggesting it may hold promise for treatment of AD.",2023,,Mice; Animals; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Brain; Cell Membrane,"Sato, W; Watanabe-Takahashi, M; Murata, T; Utsunomiya-Tate, N; Motoyama, J; Anzai, M; Ishihara, S; Nishioka, N; Uchiyama, H; Togashi, J; Nishihara, S; Kawasaki, K; Saito, T; Saido, TC; Funamoto, S; Nishikawa, K"

We aimed to assess the longitudinal relationships of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake as well as blood biomarkers with risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia, or cognitive decline. Longitudinal data were derived from 1135 participants without dementia (mean age = 73 y) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort to evaluate the associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and blood biomarkers with incident AD during the 6-y follow-up. A meta-analysis of published cohort studies was further conducted to test the longitudinal relationships of dietary intake of omega-3 and its peripheral markers with all-cause dementia or cognitive decline. Causal dose-response analyses were conducted using the robust error meta-regression model. In the ADNI cohort, long-term users of omega-3 fatty acid supplements exhibited a 64% reduced risk of AD (hazard ratio: 0.36, 95% confidence interval: 0.18, 0.72; P = 0.004). After incorporating 48 longitudinal studies involving 103,651 participants, a moderate-to-high level of evidence suggested that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids could lower risk of all-cause dementia or cognitive decline by ∼20%, especially for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake (relative risk [RR]: 0.82, I",2023,AD; biomarker; cognitive decline; dementia; dietary; omega-3 fatty acid,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Prospective Studies; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Eicosapentaenoic Acid; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dietary Supplements; Cohort Studies; Eating","Wei, BZ; Li, L; Dong, CW; Tan, CC; Xu, W"

Because of the complexity of genomic data, current statistical analyses cannot comprehensively capture the polygenic risk of AD, resulting in unsatisfactory disease risk prediction.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in the central nervous system.,"The gene encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and its protein product have been widely studied for their role in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. PCSK9 increases the rate of metabolic degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors, preventing the diffusion of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from plasma into cells and contributes to high lipoprotein-bound cholesterol levels in the plasma. While most research has focused on the regulation and disease relevance of PCSK9 to the cardiovascular system and lipid metabolism, there is a growing body of evidence that PCSK9 plays a crucial role in pathogenic processes in other organ systems, including the central nervous system. PCSK9's impact on the brain is not yet fully understood, though several recent studies have sought to illuminate its impact on various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, as well as its connection with ischemic stroke. Cerebral PCSK9 expression is low but is highly upregulated during disease states. Among others, PCSK9 is known to play a role in neurogenesis, neural cell differentiation, central LDL receptor metabolism, neural cell apoptosis, neuroinflammation, Alzheimer's Disease, Alcohol Use Disorder, and stroke. The PCSK9 gene contains several polymorphisms, including both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations which profoundly impact normal PCSK9 signaling and cholesterol metabolism. Gain-of-function mutations lead to persistent hypercholesterolemia and poor health outcomes, while loss-of-function mutations generally lead to hypocholesterolemia and may serve as a protective factor against diseases of the liver, cardiovascular system, and central nervous system. Recent genomic studies have sought to identify the end-organ effects of such mutations and continue to identify evidence of a much broader role for PCSK9 in extrahepatic organ systems. Despite this, there remain large gaps in our understanding of PCSK9, its regulation, and its effects on disease risk outside the liver. This review, which incorporates data from a wide range of scientific disciplines and experimental paradigms, is intended to describe PCSK9's role in the central nervous system as it relates to cerebral disease and neuropsychiatric disorders, and to examine the clinical potential of PCSK9 inhibitors and genetic variation in the PCSK9 gene on disease outcomes, including neurological and neuropsychiatric disease.",2023,Apoptosis; Brain; Cholesterol; LDL; Neuroinflammation; PCSK9,"Humans; Proprotein Convertase 9; Lipoproteins, LDL; Brain; Subtilisins","Bell, AS; Wagner, J; Rosoff, DB; Lohoff, FW"

Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) and blood biomarker measurements to examine differences in neuroinflammation and beta-amyloid (Aβ) and their association in cognitively unimpaired homozygotes, heterozygotes, or non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, the strongest genetic risk for sporadic AD.",2023,APOE; Alzheimer’s disease; Apolipoprotein E; Astrocytes; Beta-amyloid; Biomarker; GFAP; Microglia; PET; TSPO,"Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E4; Biomarkers; Genotype; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Positron-Emission Tomography; Receptors, GABA; Gene Dosage","Snellman, A; Ekblad, LL; Tuisku, J; Koivumäki, M; Ashton, NJ; Lantero-Rodriguez, J; Karikari, TK; Helin, S; Bucci, M; Löyttyniemi, E; Parkkola, R; Karrasch, M; Schöll, M; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Rinne, JO"
Increased plasma DYRK1A with aging may protect against neurodegenerative diseases.,"Early markers are needed for more effective prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We previously showed that individuals with Alzheimer's disease have decreased plasma DYRK1A levels compared to controls. We assessed DYRK1A in the plasma of cognitively healthy elderly volunteers, individuals with either Alzheimer's disease (AD), tauopathies or Down syndrome (DS), and in lymphoblastoids from individuals with DS. DYRK1A levels were inversely correlated with brain amyloid β burden in asymptomatic elderly individuals and AD patients. Low DYRK1A levels were also detected in patients with tauopathies. Individuals with DS had higher DYRK1A levels than controls, although levels were lower in individuals with DS and with dementia. These data suggest that plasma DYRK1A levels could be used for early detection of at risk individuals of AD and for early detection of AD. We hypothesize that lack of increase of DYRK1A at middle age (40-50 years) could be a warning before the cognitive decline, reflecting increased risk for AD.",2023,,Middle Aged; Humans; Aged; Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Down Syndrome; Tauopathies; Aging,"Delabar, JM; Lagarde, J; Fructuoso, M; Mohammad, A; Bottlaender, M; Doran, E; Lott, I; Rivals, I; Schmitt, FA; Head, E; Sarazin, M; Potier, MC"

"A randomized, open-label clinical trial in mild cognitive impairment with EGb 761 examining blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.","Although beta-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau remain the preferred targets for disease-modifying treatments (DMT) against Alzheimer's disease (AD), part of the pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment are related to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. In mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions, the joint appearance of inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic alterations are the common pathways of neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. The standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba EGb 761 interferes with the pathogenic mechanisms involved in both the development of cognitive impairment due to AD and that of vascular origin. The primary objective of this study is to compare changes in the levels of blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress after treatment with EGb 761 in a cohort of 100 patients with MCI. In addition, we aim to assess changes in these blood markers during an additional 12-month extension phase in which patients in the control group will also receive EGb 761 and patients in the active group will extend their treatment duration. Secondary objectives include comparing changes in neuropsychiatric and cognitive test scores between the baseline (v0) and 12-month visits (v2). This study is a Phase IV, single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group clinical trial consisting of the 12-month follow-up of a cohort of participants with MCI [Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) = 3] and an extension with an additional 12-month follow-up. During the first 12 months, participants will be randomized into two arms: in one arm, patients will receive 1 daily tablet of EGb 761 240 mg orally (study group, n = 50), while in the other arm, patients will not receive EGb 761 and will undergo the same assessments as the treated group (control group, n = 50). After the first 12 months of the study, patients in the EGb 761-treated group will continue treatment, and patients in the control group will be offered one EGb 761 240 mg tablet per day orally. All participants will be monitored for an additional 12 months. A battery of blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress will be quantified at v0, v1, v2, v3, and v4. The Olink Proteomics panel of inflammation markers ( https://www.olink.com/products/inflammation/ ) will be used to evaluate 92 proteins associated with inflammatory diseases and related biological processes. The second panel measures 92 proteins involved in neurological processes. At v0, v2, and v4, neuropsychological and neurological evaluations will be conducted in addition to vital signs and anthropometric studies using a body composition monitor with bioimpedance technology (Tanita). Sixty percent of the 100 MCI patients recruited were women. The mean age was 73.1 years, and the mean time between symptom onset and MCI diagnosis was 2.9 years. The mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 26.7. Depressive and anxiety disorders, as well as vascular risk factors, were the most frequent comorbidities among the cohort. The study is still ongoing, and results for the first year of treatment (v0, v1, v2) are expected by 2023. Individuals with MCI have an elevated risk of developing dementia. EGb 761 is used worldwide for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive disorders due to its neuroprotective effects. In experimental models and clinical observational studies, EGb 761 has shown strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. As a result, this study has been proposed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on plasma markers and their potential clinical correlation with the progression of cognitive decline in patients with MCI.Trial registration: Registro Español de estudios clínicos (REec) number 2020-003776-41, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05594355.",2023,,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Antioxidants; Plant Extracts; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Inflammation; Oxidative Stress,"Morató, X; Marquié, M; Tartari, JP; Lafuente, A; Abdelnour, C; Alegret, M; Jofresa, S; Buendía, M; Pancho, A; Aguilera, N; Ibarria, M; Diego, S; Cuevas, R; Cañada, L; Calvet, A; Antonio, EE; Pérez-Cordón, A; Sanabria, Á; de Rojas, I; Nuñez-Llaves, R; Cano, A; Orellana, A; Montrreal, L; Cañabate, P; Rosende-Roca, M; Vargas, L; Bojaryn, U; Ricciardi, M; Ariton, DM; Espinosa, A; Ortega, G; Muñoz, N; Lleonart, N; Alarcón-Martín, E; Moreno, M; Preckler, S; Tantinya, N; Ramis, M; Nogales, AB; Seguer, S; Martín, E; Pytel, V; Valero, S; Gurruchaga, M; Tárraga, L; Ruiz, A; Boada, M"

Imaging blood-brain barrier disruption in neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the neurovascular structure that regulates the passage of cells and molecules to and from the central nervous system (CNS). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with gradual breakdown of the BBB, permitting entry of plasma-derived neurotoxins, inflammatory cells, and microbial pathogens into the CNS. BBB permeability can be visualized directly in AD patients using imaging technologies including dynamic contrast-enhanced and arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging, and recent studies employing these techniques have shown that subtle changes in BBB stability occur prior to deposition of the pathological hallmarks of AD, senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. These studies suggest that BBB disruption may be useful as an early diagnostic marker; however, AD is also accompanied by neuroinflammation, which can complicate these analyses. This review will outline the structural and functional changes to the BBB that occur during AD pathogenesis and highlight current imaging technologies that can detect these subtle changes. Advancing these technologies will improve both the diagnosis and treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",2023,aging; inflammation; magnetic resonance imaging; neurodegenerative diseases; neurovascular,,"Lee, RL; Funk, KE"

Non-invasive auditory and visual stimulation attenuates α-Synuclein deposition and improves motor and non-motor symptoms in PD mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss and α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates, but lacks effective treatments for the disease progression and non-motor symptoms. Recently, combined 40 Hz auditory and visual stimulation is emerging as a promising non-invasive method to decrease amyloid and improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether this treatment can modify α-Syn-induced PD pathology remains unclear. Here we evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to 40 Hz and 80 Hz auditory and visual stimulation on α-Syn accumulation and the functional effects of 40 Hz stimulation on motor, cognitive and mood dysfunctions in PD mice. We found that 40 Hz and 80 Hz auditory and visual stimulation activated multiple cortical regions, entrained gamma oscillations and markedly attenuated p-α-Syn deposition in neurons, but not astrocytes, microglial cells in the primary and secondary motor cortex (M1, M2), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the striatum. Moreover, 40 Hz stimulation significantly reduced cell apoptosis in M1, increased the neuromuscular strength selectively in PD mice, which correlated with p-α-Syn reduction in the motor cortex. In addition, 40 Hz stimulation improved spatial working memory and decreased depressive-like behaviors specifically in PD mice, which correlated with p-α-Syn reduction in mPFC, but promoted anxiety-like behaviors and increased stress-related adreno-cortico-tropic-hormone (ACTH), corticosterone levels in the plasma of normal mice. Collectively, we demonstrated that chronic multisensory gamma stimulation (40 Hz and 80 Hz) significantly attenuates α-Syn deposition in neurons of the interconnected cortex and 40 Hz stimulation improved neuromuscular strength, spatial working memory, and reduced depressive behaviors, which support its non-invasive therapeutic potential for modifying PD progression and treating non-motor symptoms.",2023,Auditory and visual gamma stimulation; Non-invasive therapy; Parkinson's disease; α-Synuclein,Mice; Animals; Parkinson Disease; alpha-Synuclein; Photic Stimulation; Brain; Dopaminergic Neurons,"Liu, Y; Liu, H; Lu, Y; Yin, X; Lu, W; Lian, X; Wang, K; Shi, C; Yao, Z; Chen, JF; Li, Z"

Integrative Blood-Based Characterization of Oxidative Mitochondrial DNA Damage Variants Implicates Mexican Americans' Metabolic Risk for Developing Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continues to be a leading cause of death in the US. As the US aging population (ages 65+) expands, the impact will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, e.g., Hispanic/Latinx population, due to their AD-related health disparities. Age-related regression in mitochondrial activity and ethnic-specific differences in metabolic burden could potentially explain in part the racial/ethnic distinctions in etiology that exist for AD. Oxidation of guanine (G) to 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG) is a prevalent lesion and an indicator of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Damaged mtDNA (8oxoG) can serve as an important marker of age-related systemic metabolic dysfunction and upon release into peripheral circulation may exacerbate pathophysiology contributing to AD development and/or progression. Analyzing blood samples from Mexican American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants enrolled in the Texas Alzheimer's Research & Care Consortium, we used blood-based measurements of 8oxoG from both buffy coat PBMCs and plasma to determine associations with population, sex, type-2 diabetes, and AD risk. Our results show that 8oxoG levels in both buffy coat and plasma were significantly associated with population, sex, years of education, and reveal a potential association with AD. Furthermore, MAs are significantly burdened by mtDNA oxidative damage in both blood fractions, which may contribute to their metabolic vulnerability to developing AD.",2023,,,"Reid, DM; Barber, RC; Jones, HP; Thorpe, RJ; Sun, J; Zhou, Z; Phillips, NR"
Novel LC-MS/MS analysis of the GLP-1 analog semaglutide with its application to pharmacokinetics and brain distribution studies in rats.,"Semaglutide, one of the most potent glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 analogs, has widely been used to treat type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. Recent studies have shown that semaglutide also works on the brain, suggesting its potential utility for various diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to develop a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of semaglutide in both plasma and brain to characterize the pharmacokinetics and brain distribution in rats. Semaglutide was extracted by simple protein precipitation with methanol from plasma and by solid phase extraction from brain tissue. Liraglutide was used as an internal standard. Gradient elution profiles with mobile phases comprising 0.1 % formic acid in water and acetonitrile were used for chromatographic separation. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the LC-MS/MS assay was 0.5 ng/mL for both rat plasma and brain. Intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged 89.20-109.50 % in the plasma and 92.00-105.00 % in the brain. Precision was within 8.92 % in the plasma and 7.94 % in the brain. Sprague-Dawley rats were given semaglutide by intravenous (IV, 0.02 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) injection.

Ubiquitin Is Not a Blood Biomarker of an Early Cognitive Decline in the Polish Elderly.,"Together with development of new pharmaceutical interventions, as well as the introduction of the concept of initial dementia phase, the demand for early diagnosis has been growing. Research on potential blood biomarkers, amazingly attractive, mainly due to the facility of deriving the material, has provided ambiguous results throughout. The existence of an association between ubiquitin and Alzheimer's disease pathology suggests that it could be a potential neurodegeneration biomarker. The present study aims to identify and assess the relationship between ubiquitin with regard to the adequacy as a biomarker of an initial dementia and cognitive decline in the elderly. Method: The study sample was composed of 230 participants: 109 women and 121 men aged 65 and older. The relationships of plasma ubiquitin levels with cognitive performance, gender, and age were analyzed. The assessments were performed in three groups of cognitive functioning level: cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and mild dementia, of which the subjects were divided with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: No significant disparities in plasma ubiquitin levels for various levels of cognitive functioning were identified. Significantly higher plasma ubiquitin levels in women were found in comparison to men. No significant differences were found in ubiquitin concentrations based on age. Results suggest that ubiquitin does not meet the requirements for qualification as a blood biomarker of an early cognitive decline. In order to thoroughly evaluate the potential of research on ubiquitin in connection to an early neurodegenerative process, further studies are needed.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; blood; dementia; mild cognitive impairment; ubiquitin,,"McFarlane, O; Kozakiewicz, M; Wojciechowska, M; Kędziora-Kornatowska, K"

Seed amplification and neurodegeneration marker trajectories in individuals at risk of prion disease.,"Human prion diseases are remarkable for long incubation times followed typically by rapid clinical decline. Seed amplification assays and neurodegeneration biofluid biomarkers are remarkably useful in the clinical phase, but their potential to predict clinical onset in healthy people remains unclear. This is relevant not only to the design of preventive strategies in those at-risk of prion diseases, but more broadly, because prion-like mechanisms are thought to underpin many neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report the accrual of a longitudinal biofluid resource in patients, controls and healthy people at risk of prion diseases, to which ultrasensitive techniques such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and single molecule array (Simoa) digital immunoassays were applied for preclinical biomarker discovery. We studied 648 CSF and plasma samples, including 16 people who had samples taken when healthy but later developed inherited prion disease (IPD) ('converters'; range from 9.9 prior to, and 7.4 years after onset). Symptomatic IPD CSF samples were screened by RT-QuIC assay variations, before testing the entire collection of at-risk samples using the most sensitive assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), tau and UCH-L1 levels were measured in plasma and CSF. Second generation (IQ-CSF) RT-QuIC proved 100% sensitive and specific for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), iatrogenic and familial CJD phenotypes, and subsequently detected seeding activity in four presymptomatic CSF samples from three E200K carriers; one converted in under 2 months while two remain asymptomatic after at least 3 years' follow-up. A bespoke HuPrP P102L RT-QuIC showed partial sensitivity for P102L disease. No compatible RT-QuIC assay was discovered for classical 6-OPRI, A117V and D178N, and these at-risk samples tested negative with bank vole RT-QuIC. Plasma GFAP and NfL, and CSF NfL levels emerged as proximity markers of neurodegeneration in the typically slow IPDs (e.g. P102L), with significant differences in mean values segregating healthy control from IPD carriers (within 2 years to onset) and symptomatic IPD cohorts; plasma GFAP appears to change before NfL, and before clinical conversion. In conclusion, we show distinct biomarker trajectories in fast and slow IPDs. Specifically, we identify several years of presymptomatic seeding positivity in E200K, a new proximity marker (plasma GFAP) and sequential neurodegenerative marker evolution (plasma GFAP followed by NfL) in slow IPDs. We suggest a new preclinical staging system featuring clinical, seeding and neurodegeneration aspects, for validation with larger prion at-risk cohorts, and with potential application to other neurodegenerative proteopathies.",2023,GFAP; NfL; RT-QuIC; inherited; prion,Humans; tau Proteins; Prion Diseases; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Prions; Biomarkers,"Mok, TH; Nihat, A; Majbour, N; Sequeira, D; Holm-Mercer, L; Coysh, T; Darwent, L; Batchelor, M; Groveman, BR; Orr, CD; Hughson, AG; Heslegrave, A; Laban, R; Veleva, E; Paterson, RW; Keshavan, A; Schott, JM; Swift, IJ; Heller, C; Rohrer, JD; Gerhard, A; Butler, C; Rowe, JB; Masellis, M; Chapman, M; Lunn, MP; Bieschke, J; Jackson, GS; Zetterberg, H; Caughey, B; Rudge, P; Collinge, J; Mead, S"
Plasma proteomics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity reveals impact on Alzheimer's and coronary disease pathways.,"Identification of proteins dysregulated by COVID-19 infection is critically important for better understanding of its pathophysiology, building prognostic models, and identifying new targets. Plasma proteomic profiling of 4,301 proteins was performed in two independent datasets and tested for the association for three COVID-19 outcomes (infection, ventilation, and death). We identified 1,449 proteins consistently associated in both datasets with any of these three outcomes. We subsequently created highly accurate models that distinctively predict infection, ventilation, and death. These proteins were enriched in specific biological processes including cytokine signaling, Alzheimer's disease, and coronary artery disease. Mendelian randomization and gene network analyses identified eight causal proteins and 141 highly connected hub proteins including 35 with known drug targets.

Identification of plasma metabolites associated with modifiable risk factors and endophenotypes reflecting Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"Modifiable factors can influence the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and serve as targets for intervention; however, the biological mechanisms linking these factors to AD are unknown. This study aims to identify plasma metabolites associated with modifiable factors for AD, including MIND diet, physical activity, smoking, and caffeine intake, and test their association with AD endophenotypes to identify their potential roles in pathophysiological mechanisms. The association between each of the 757 plasma metabolites and four modifiable factors was tested in the wisconsin registry for Alzheimer's prevention cohort of initially cognitively unimpaired, asymptomatic middle-aged adults. After Bonferroni correction, the significant plasma metabolites were tested for association with each of the AD endophenotypes, including twelve cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, reflecting key pathophysiologies for AD, and four cognitive composite scores. Finally, causal mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate possible mediation effects. Analyses were performed using linear mixed-effects regression. A total of 27, 3, 23, and 24 metabolites were associated with MIND diet, physical activity, smoking, and caffeine intake, respectively. Potential mediation effects include beta-cryptoxanthin in the association between MIND diet and preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite score, hippurate between MIND diet and immediate learning, glutamate between physical activity and CSF neurofilament light, and beta-cryptoxanthin between smoking and immediate learning. Our study identified several plasma metabolites that are associated with modifiable factors.

Immunotherapy targeting plasma ASM is protective in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathology, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific role of plasma ASM in promoting these pathologies is poorly understood. Herein, we explore plasma ASM as a circulating factor that accelerates neuropathological features in AD by exposing young APP/PS1 mice to the blood of mice overexpressing ASM, through parabiotic surgery. Elevated plasma ASM was found to enhance several neuropathological features in the young APP/PS1 mice by mediating the differentiation of blood-derived, pathogenic Th17 cells. Antibody-based immunotherapy targeting plasma ASM showed efficient inhibition of ASM activity in the blood of APP/PS1 mice and, interestingly, led to prophylactic effects on neuropathological features by suppressing pathogenic Th17 cells. Our data reveals insights into the potential pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD and highlights ASM-targeting immunotherapy as a potential strategy for further investigation.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mice, Transgenic; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase; Disease Models, Animal; Immunotherapy; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Choi, BJ; Park, MH; Park, KH; Han, WH; Yoon, HJ; Jung, HY; Hong, JY; Chowdhury, MR; Kim, KY; Lee, J; Song, IS; Pang, M; Choi, MK; Gulbins, E; Reichel, M; Kornhuber, J; Hong, CW; Kim, C; Kim, SH; Schuchman, EH; Jin, HK; Bae, JS"
Associations of ApoE4 status and DHA supplementation on plasma and CSF lipid profiles and entorhinal cortex thickness.,"Apolipoprotein ε allele 4 (APOE4) influences the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The entorhinal cortex (EC) in the brain is affected early in Alzheimer's disease and is rich in DHA. The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of APOE4 and DHA lipid species on the EC. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipidomic measurements were obtained from the DHA Brain Delivery Pilot, a randomized clinical trial of DHA supplementation (n = 10) versus placebo (n = 12) for six months in nondemented older adults stratified by APOE4 status. Wild-type C57B6/J mice were fed a high or low DHA diet for 6 months followed by plasma and brain lipidomic analysis. Levels of phosphatidylcholine DHA (PC 38:6) and cholesterol ester DHA (CE 22:6) had the largest increases in CSF following supplementation (P < 0.001). DHA within triglyceride (TG) lipids in CSF strongly correlated with corresponding plasma TG lipids, and differed by APOE4, with carriers having a lower increase than noncarriers. Changes in plasma PC DHA had the strongest association with changes in EC thickness in millimeters, independent of APOE4 status (P = 0.007). In mice, a high DHA diet increased PUFAs within brain lipids. Our findings demonstrate an exchange of DHA at the CSF-blood barrier and into the brain within all lipid species with APOE having the strongest effect on DHA-containing TGs.

Predictive Utility of Plasma Amyloid and Tau for Cognitive Decline in Cognitively Normal Adults.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting mostly elderly adults. Recent diagnostic criteria for AD recommend the use of imaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers together with clinical presentation for a more persuasive diagnosis. The invasiveness and expense of such examinations have led to the search for blood-based biomarkers. The plasma levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein and tau peptides have been found to correlate with CSF levels and imaging findings in patients with AD.

Beyond the amyloid hypothesis: how current research implicates autoimmunity in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"The amyloid hypothesis has so far been at the forefront of explaining the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and eventual death. Recent evidence, however, points to additional factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. These include the neurovascular hypothesis, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, the prion hypothesis, the mutational accumulation hypothesis, and the autoimmunity hypothesis. The purpose of this review was to briefly discuss the factors that are associated with autoimmunity in humans, including sex, the gut and lung microbiomes, age, genetics, and environmental factors. Subsequently, it was to examine the rise of autoimmune phenomena in AD, which can be instigated by a blood-brain barrier breakdown, pathogen infections, and dysfunction of the glymphatic system. Lastly, it was to discuss the various ways by which immune system dysregulation leads to AD, immunomodulating therapies, and future directions in the field of autoimmunity and neurodegeneration. A comprehensive account of the recent research done in the field was extracted from PubMed on 31 January 2022, with the keywords ""Alzheimer's disease"" and ""autoantibodies"" for the first search input, and ""Alzheimer's disease"" with ""IgG"" for the second. From the first search, 19 papers were selected, because they contained recent research on the autoantibodies found in the biofluids of patients with AD. From the second search, four papers were selected. The analysis of the literature has led to support the autoimmune hypothesis in AD. Autoantibodies were found in biofluids (serum/plasma, cerebrospinal fluid) of patients with AD with multiple methods, including ELISA, Mass Spectrometry, and microarray analysis.

Plasma tau and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and their relation to cognitive functions.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia. The cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with this disorder often have overlapping characteristics, potentially resulting in delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. This study aimed to assess the level of peripheral blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) and total tau (t-tau) protein in AD patients and investigate their relationship with cognitive impairment. The study included 80 participants of both sexes between the ages of 60 to 85 years. The participants were divided into two groups, consisting of 40 individuals in the control group (mean age 75±6.6 years) who had no cognitive or functional impairments and 40 AD patients (mean age 74.98±5.03 years). This study utilized the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for major or mild neurocognitive disorder attributed to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The clinical and biochemical features of all participants were documented, and the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores were evaluated. Sandwich ELISA was employed to determine serum NfL and t-tau protein levels. The median serum NfL and t-tau protein levels in AD patients were significantly higher than those of the controls (47.84 pg/ml versus 17.66 pg/ml and 12.05 pg/ml versus 11.13 pg/ml, respectively). Age was positively correlated with NfL, t-tau levels, and ADAS-cog.

Sensitive label-free detection of the biomarker phosphorylated tau-217 protein in Alzheimer's disease using a graphene-based solution-gated field effect transistor.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is generally diagnosed using advanced imaging, but recent research suggests early screening using biomarkers in peripheral blood is feasible; among them, plasma tau proteins phosphorylated at threonine 231, threonine 181, and threonine 217 (p-tau217) are potential targets. A recent study indicates that the p-tau217 protein is the most efficacious biomarker. However, a clinical study found a pg/ml threshold for AD screening beyond standard detection methods. A biosensor with high sensitivity and specificity p-tau217 detection has not yet been reported. In this study, we developed a label-free solution-gated field effect transistor (SGFET)-based biosensor featuring a graphene oxide/graphene (GO/G) layered composite. The top layer of bilayer graphene grown using chemical vapor deposition was functionalized with oxidative groups serving as active sites for forming covalent bonds with the biorecognition element (antibodies); the bottom G could act as a transducer to respond to the attachment of the target analytes onto the top GO conjugated with the biorecognition element via π-π interactions between the GO and G layers. With this unique atomically layered G composite, we obtained a good linear electrical response in the Dirac point shift to p-tau217 protein concentrations in the range of 10 fg/ml to 100 pg/ml. The biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity of 18.6 mV/decade with a high linearity of 0.991 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); in human serum albumin, it showed approximately 90% of the sensitivity (16.7 mV/decade) in PBS, demonstrating high specificity.

Plasma phospho-tau in Alzheimer's disease: towards diagnostic and therapeutic trial applications.,"As the leading cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major burden on affected individuals, their families and caregivers, and healthcare systems. Although AD can be identified and diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid or neuroimaging biomarkers that concord with neuropathological evidence and clinical symptoms, challenges regarding practicality and accessibility hinder their widespread availability and implementation. Consequently, many people with suspected cognitive impairment due to AD do not receive a biomarker-supported diagnosis. Blood biomarkers have the capacity to help expand access to AD diagnostics worldwide. One such promising biomarker is plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau), which has demonstrated specificity to AD versus non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, and will be extremely important to inform on clinical diagnosis and eligibility for therapies that have recently been approved. This review provides an update on the diagnostic and prognostic performances of plasma p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231, and their associations with in vivo and autopsy-verified diagnosis and pathological hallmarks. Additionally, we discuss potential applications and unanswered questions of plasma p-tau for therapeutic trials, given their recent addition to the biomarker toolbox for participant screening, recruitment and during-trial monitoring. Outstanding questions include assay standardization, threshold generation and biomarker verification in diverse cohorts reflective of the wider community attending memory clinics and included in clinical trials.",2023,Alzheimer; Blood biomarker; Dementia; Phosphorylated tau; Plasma p-tau; s disease,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Neuropathology; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Gonzalez-Ortiz, F; Kac, PR; Brum, WS; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Karikari, TK"

Plasma amyloid-β42/40 and apolipoprotein E for amyloid PET pre-screening in secondary prevention trials of Alzheimer's disease.,"The extent to which newly developed blood-based biomarkers could reduce screening costs in secondary prevention trials of Alzheimer's disease is mostly unexplored.

We tested whether a model predicting amyloid PET status from plasma amyloid-β42/40, apolipoprotein E status and age (combined) reduced cost of recruiting amyloid PET + cognitively unimpaired participants into a theoretical trial.

Fatty Acid Profile and Genetic Variants of Proteins Involved in Fatty Acid Metabolism Could Be Considered as Disease Predictor.,"Circulating fatty acids (FA) have an endogenous or exogenous origin and are metabolized under the effect of many enzymes. They play crucial roles in many mechanisms: cell signaling, modulation of gene expression, etc., which leads to the hypothesis that their perturbation could be the cause of disease development. FA in erythrocytes and plasma rather than dietary FA could be used as a biomarker for many diseases. Cardiovascular disease was associated with elevated trans FA and decreased DHA and EPA. Increased arachidonic acid and decreased Docosahexaenoic Acids (DHA) were associated with Alzheimer's disease. Low Arachidonic acid and DHA are associated with neonatal morbidities and mortality. Decreased saturated fatty acids (SFA), increased monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) (C18:2 n-6 and C20:3 n-6) are associated with cancer. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for enzymes implicated in FA metabolism are associated with disease development. FA desaturase (FADS1 and FADS2) polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease, Acute Coronary Syndrome, Autism spectrum disorder and obesity. Polymorphisms in FA elongase (ELOVL2) are associated with Alzheimer's disease, Autism spectrum disorder and obesity. FA-binding protein polymorphism is associated with dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, peripheral atherosclerosis combined with type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase polymorphisms are associated with diabetes, obesity and diabetic nephropathy. FA profile and genetic variants of proteins implicated in FA metabolism could be considered as disease biomarkers and may help with the prevention and management of diseases.",2023,diseases; fatty acids; gene polymorphisms; plasma; red blood cells,,"Chaaba, R; Bouaziz, A; Ben Amor, A; Mnif, W; Hammami, M; Mehri, S"
Neurofilament-light chain quantification by Simoa and Ella in plasma from patients with dementia: a comparative study.,"Neurofilament light chains (NfL) are neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins whose plasmatic concentrations have been explored as a clinically useful marker in several types of dementia. Plasma concentrations of NfL are extremely low, and just two assays are commercially available for their study: one based on the SiMoA technology and one based on Ella. We thus studied plasma levels of NfL with both platforms to check the correlation between them and to assess their potential in the diagnosis of neurodegeneration. Plasma NfL levels were measured on 50 subjects: 18 healthy controls, 20 Alzheimer's disease, and 12 frontotemporal dementia patients. Ella returned plasmatic NfL levels significantly higher than SiMoA, however the results were strongly correlated (r = 0.94), and a proportional coefficient of 0.58 between the two assays was calculated. Both assays detected higher plasma NfL levels in patients with dementia than in the control group (p < 0.0001) and allowed their discrimination with excellent diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.95). No difference was found between Alzheimer's and Frontotemporal dementia either using SiMoA or Ella. In conclusion, both the analytical platforms resulted effective in analysing plasma levels of NfL. However, the correct interpretation of results requires the precise knowledge of the assay used.",2023,,Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Intermediate Filaments; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofilament Proteins; Cytoskeletal Proteins,"Truffi, M; Garofalo, M; Ricciardi, A; Cotta Ramusino, M; Perini, G; Scaranzin, S; Gastaldi, M; Albasini, S; Costa, A; Chiavetta, V; Corsi, F; Morasso, C; Gagliardi, S"
Rab10 regulates the sorting of internalised TrkB for retrograde axonal transport.,"Neurons process real-time information from axon terminals to coordinate gene expression, growth, and plasticity. Inputs from distal axons are encoded as a stream of endocytic organelles, termed signalling endosomes, targeted to the soma. Formation of these organelles depends on target-derived molecules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is recognised by TrkB receptors on the plasma membrane, endocytosed, and transported to the cell body along the microtubules network. Notwithstanding its physiological and neuropathological importance, the mechanism controlling the sorting of TrkB to signalling endosomes is currently unknown. In this work, we use primary mouse neurons to uncover the small GTPase Rab10 as critical for TrkB sorting and propagation of BDNF signalling from axon terminals to the soma. Our data demonstrate that Rab10 defines a novel membrane compartment that is rapidly mobilised towards the axon terminal upon BDNF stimulation, enabling the axon to fine-tune retrograde signalling depending on BDNF availability at the synapse. These results help clarifying the neuroprotective phenotype recently associated to Rab10 polymorphisms in Alzheimer's disease and provide a new therapeutic target to halt neurodegeneration.",2023,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; KIF13B; mouse; neuroscience; neurotrophin; signalling endosome; small GTPases,"Animals; Mice; Axonal Transport; Axons; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Neurons; Protein Transport; rab GTP-Binding Proteins; Receptor, trkB","Lazo, OM; Schiavo, G"
Modulating heart rate oscillation affects plasma amyloid beta and tau levels in younger and older adults.,"Slow paced breathing via heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback stimulates vagus-nerve pathways that counter noradrenergic stress and arousal pathways that can influence production and clearance of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related proteins. Thus, we examined whether HRV biofeedback intervention affects plasma Αβ40, Αβ42, total tau (tTau), and phosphorylated tau-181 (pTau-181) levels. We randomized healthy adults (N = 108) to use slow-paced breathing with HRV biofeedback to increase heart rate oscillations (Osc+) or to use personalized strategies with HRV biofeedback to decrease heart rate oscillations (Osc-). They practiced 20-40 min daily. Four weeks of practicing the Osc+ and Osc- conditions produced large effect size differences in change in plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels. The Osc+ condition decreased plasma Αβ while the Osc- condition increased Αβ. Decreases in Αβ were associated with decreases in gene transcription indicators of β-adrenergic signaling, linking effects to the noradrenergic system. There were also opposing effects of the Osc+ and Osc- interventions on tTau for younger adults and pTau-181 for older adults.

Missorting of plasma miRNAs in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"The observation that aging is regulated by microRNAs (miRNA) and at the same time represents the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), prompted us to examine the circulating miRNA network in AD beyond aging. We here show that plasma miRNAs in aging are downregulated and predicted to be preferentially targeted to the extracellular vesicle (EV) content. In AD, miRNAs are further downregulated, display altered proportions of motifs relevant to their loading into EVs and secretion propensity, and are forecast to be found exclusively in EVs. The circulating miRNA network in AD, therefore, reflects pathological exacerbation of the aging process whereby physiological suppression of AD pathology by miRNAs becomes insufficient.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; aging; endosomes; extracellular vesicles; miRNA; ncRNA; plasma; short sequence motifs,Humans; MicroRNAs; Alzheimer Disease; Extracellular Vesicles; Aging,"Čarna, M; Novotny, JS; Dragišić, N; Slavik, H; Sheardova, K; Geda, YE; Vyhnalek, M; Laczo, J; Hort, J; Mao, Z; Rissman, RA; Hajduch, M; Dammer, EB; Stokin, GB"

Activity and Structural Dynamics of Human ABCA1 in a Lipid Membrane.,"The human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCA1 plays a critical role in lipid homeostasis as it extracts sterols and phospholipids from the plasma membrane for excretion to the extracellular apolipoprotein A-I and subsequent formation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Deleterious mutations of ABCA1 lead to sterol accumulation and are associated with atherosclerosis, poor cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism by which ABCA1 drives lipid movement is poorly understood, and a unified platform to produce active ABCA1 protein for both functional and structural studies has been missing. In this work, we established a stable expression system for both a human cell-based sterol export assay and protein purification for in vitro biochemical and structural studies. ABCA1 produced in this system was active in sterol export and displayed enhanced ATPase activity after reconstitution into a lipid bilayer. Our single-particle cryo-EM study of ABCA1 in nanodiscs showed protein induced membrane curvature, revealed multiple distinct conformations, and generated a structure of nanodisc-embedded ABCA1 at 4.0-Å resolution representing a previously unknown conformation. Comparison of different ABCA1 structures and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrates both concerted domain movements and conformational variations within each domain. Taken together, our platform for producing and characterizing ABCA1 in a lipid membrane enabled us to gain important mechanistic and structural insights and paves the way for investigating modulators that target the functions of ABCA1.",2023,ABC transporter; cholesterol; cryo-electron microscopy; membrane transport; membrane transporter reconstitution,Humans; Apolipoprotein A-I; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1; Cell Membrane; Phospholipids; Sterols; Membrane Lipids; Mutation; Lipid Bilayers; Single Molecule Imaging,"Plummer-Medeiros, AM; Culbertson, AT; Morales-Perez, CL; Liao, M"

Advances in sample preparation and HPLC-MS/MS methods for determining amyloid-β peptide in biological samples: a review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurological disorder, is a major public health concern and the most common form of dementia. Its typical symptoms include memory loss, confusion, changes in personality, and cognitive impairment, which result in patients gradually losing independence. Over the last decades, some studies have focused on searching for effective biomarkers as early diagnostic indicators of AD. Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides have been consolidated as reliable AD biomarkers and have been incorporated into modern diagnostic research criteria. However, quantitative analysis of Aβ peptides in biological samples remains a challenge because both the sample and the physical-chemical properties of these peptides are complex. During clinical routine, Aβ peptides are measured in the cerebrospinal fluid by immunoassays, but the availability of a specific antibody is critical-in some cases, an antibody may not exist, or its specificity may be inadequate, leading to low sensitivity and false results. HPLC-MS/MS has been reported as a sensitive and selective method for determining different fragments of Aβ peptides in biological samples simultaneously. Developments in sample preparation techniques (preconcentration platforms) such as immunoprecipitation, 96-well plate SPME, online SPME, and fiber-in-tube SPME have enabled not only effective enrichment of Aβ peptides present at trace levels in biological samples, but also efficient exclusion of interferents from the sample matrix (sample cleanup). This high extraction efficiency has provided MS platforms with higher sensitivity.

Is type 2 diabetes associated dementia a microvascular early-Alzheimer's phenotype induced by aberrations in the peripheral metabolism of lipoprotein-amyloid?,"There is increasing evidence of a positive association of type 2 diabetes with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia. Suggested pathways include cerebral vascular dysfunction; central insulin resistance, or exaggerated brain abundance of potentially cytotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ), a hallmark feature of AD. However, contemporary studies find that Aβ is secreted in the periphery by lipogenic organs and secreted as nascent triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL's). Pre-clinical models show that exaggerated abundance in blood of TRL-Aβ compromises blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, resulting in extravasation of the TRL-Aβ moiety to brain parenchyme, neurovascular inflammation and neuronal degeneration concomitant with cognitive decline. Inhibiting secretion of TRL-Aβ by peripheral lipogenic organs attenuates the early-AD phenotype indicated in animal models, consistent with causality. Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes commonly features hypertriglyceridemia because of exaggerated TRL secretion and reduced rates of catabolism. Alzheimer's in diabetes may therefore be a consequence of heightened abundance in blood of lipoprotein-Aβ and accelerated breakdown of the BBB. This review reconciles the prevailing dogma of amyloid associated cytotoxicity as a primary risk factor in late-onset AD, with substantial evidence of a microvascular axis for dementia-in-diabetes.

The Influence of Agricultural Work and Plasma Uric Acid on Hospital Admission for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Exposure to environmental neurotoxins associated with agricultural work, such as pesticides, may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. There is strong evidence that such exposure is associated with the development of PD; for AD the current evidence is equivocal. Several mechanisms are proposed to mediate this environmental toxicity, one of which is oxidative stress.

Systematic review of brain and blood lipidomics in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is based on invasive and expensive biomarkers. Regarding AD pathophysiological mechanisms, there is evidence of a link between AD and aberrant lipid homeostasis. Alterations in lipid composition have been observed in blood and brain samples, and transgenic mouse models represent a promising approach. Nevertheless, there is great variability among studies in mice for the determination of different types of lipids in targeted and untargeted methods. It could be explained by the different variables (model, age, sex, analytical technique), and experimental conditions used. The aim of this work is to review the studies on lipid alteration in brain tissue and blood samples from AD mouse models, focusing on different experimental parameters. As result, great disparity has been observed among the reviewed studies. Brain studies showed an increase in gangliosides, sphingomyelins, lysophospholipids and monounsaturated fatty acids and a decrease in sulfatides. In contrast, blood studies showed an increase in phosphoglycerides, sterols, diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a decrease in phospholipids, lysophospholipids and monounsaturated fatty acids. Thus, lipids are closely related to AD, and a consensus on lipidomics studies could be used as a diagnostic tool and providing insight into the mechanisms involved in AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Brain; Lipidomics; Lipids; Mouse model; Plasma,"Animals; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Lipidomics; Lysophospholipids; Mice, Transgenic","Ferré-González, L; Lloret, A; Cháfer-Pericás, C"

Protective effects of curcumin and Ginkgo biloba extract combination on a new model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative illnesses, and yet, no workable treatments have been discovered to prevent or reverse AD. Curcumin (CUR), the major polyphenolic compound of turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizomes, and Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) are natural substances derived from conventional Chinese herbs that have long been shown to provide therapeutic advantages for AD. The uptake of curcumin into the brain is severely restricted by its low ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Meanwhile, GBE has been shown to improve BBB permeability. The present study evaluated the neuroprotective effects and pharmacokinetic profile of curcumin and GBE combination to find out whether GBE can enhance curcumin's beneficial effects in AD by raising its brain concentration. Results revealed that CUR + GBE achieved significantly higher levels of curcumin in the brain and plasma after 30 min and 1 h of oral administration, compared to curcumin alone, and this was confirmed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The effect of combined oral treatment, for 28 successive days, on cognitive function and other AD-like alterations was studied in scopolamine-heavy metal mixtures (SCO + HMM) AD model in rats. The combination reversed at least, partially on the learning and memory impairment induced by SCO + HMM. This was associated with a more pronounced inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), caspase-3, hippocampal amyloid beta (Aβ1-42), and phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) count, and pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukine-1beta (IL-1β), as compared to the curcumin alone-treated group. Additionally, the combined treatment significantly decreased lipid peroxidation (MDA) and increased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), when compared with the curcumin alone. These findings support the concept that the combination strategy might be an alternative therapy in the management/prevention of neurological disorders. This study sheds light on a new approach for exploring new phyto-therapies for AD and emphasizes that more research should focus on the synergic effects of herbal drugs in future.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Curcumin; Ginkgo biloba extract; Heavy metal mixtures; Pro-inflammatory cytokines; Scopolamine,Animals; Rats; Acetylcholinesterase; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Curcumin; Neuroprotective Agents; Ginkgo Extract; Humans; Blood-Brain Barrier,"Assi, AA; Farrag, MMY; Badary, DM; Allam, EAH; Nicola, MA"

Neutron Activation Analysis: An Excellent Nondestructive Analytical Technique for Trace Metal Analysis.,"For proper functioning of the human body, several metals are required in different concentrations but if their concentration slightly elevates, because of any metal-contaminated environment or of other food sources, which leads to high toxicity and different chronic health issues. Different analytical techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma- mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy are used for metals analysis present in different samples in different fields but nowadays neutron activation analysis (NAA) is preferred over other analytical techniques because it is an efficient, multi-elemental, nondestructive analytical technique having an ultralow minimum detection limit, therefore it can detect heavy metals (HMs) even if at a very trace level parts per billion (ppb) with a quite simple sample preparation technique. This technique is known as ""referee technique"" because of its accuracy and trustworthiness. There is a widespread use of this technique in biomedical science like in Alzheimer's disease, cancer, arthritis, metabolism study, brain tumor and in many more conditions where metals are actively present. For its typical sample sizes and due to a multitude of additional benefits, it also helps in mapping of pathophysiology of the disease. Besides all, mainly in biomedical science the biological samples can easily be analyzed irrespective of any form. In recent years NAA is preferred over other analytical techniques in several research fields, so this article focuses on the analytical technique, its general principle and recent applications.",2023,Biomedical field; heavy metals (HMs); minimum detection limit (MDL); neutron activation analysis (NAA),,"Das, DD; Sharma, N; Chawla, PA"

Peripheral metabolism of lipoprotein-amyloid beta as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease: potential interactive effects of APOE genotype with dietary fats.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by brain parenchymal abundance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and the accumulation of lipofuscin material that is rich in neutral lipids. However, the mechanisms for aetiology of AD are presently not established. There is increasing evidence that metabolism of lipoprotein-Aβ in blood is associated with AD risk, via a microvascular axis that features breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, extravasation of lipoprotein-Aβ to brain parenchyme and thereafter heightened inflammation. A peripheral lipoprotein-Aβ/capillary axis for AD reconciles alternate hypotheses for a vascular, or amyloid origin of disease, with amyloidosis being probably consequential. Dietary fats may markedly influence the plasma abundance of lipoprotein-Aβ and by extension AD risk. Similarly, apolipoprotein E (Apo E) serves as the primary ligand by which lipoproteins are cleared from plasma via high-affinity receptors, for binding to extracellular matrices and thereafter for uptake of lipoprotein-Aβ via resident inflammatory cells. The epsilon APOE ε4 isoform, a major risk factor for AD, is associated with delayed catabolism of lipoproteins and by extension may increase AD risk due to increased exposure to circulating lipoprotein-Aβ and microvascular corruption.",2023,APOE; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid-beta; Dementia; Genetic; Lipoprotein; Nutrition; Saturated fat; Vascular,,"D'Alonzo, ZJ; Lam, V; Takechi, R; Nesbit, M; Vaccarezza, M; Mamo, JCL"

The Curcumin Derivative GT863 Protects Cell Membranes in Cytotoxicity by Aβ Oligomers.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), accumulation of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is one of the major mechanisms causing neuronal cell damage. Disruption of cell membranes by Aβ has been hypothesized to be the important event associated with neurotoxicity in AD. Curcumin has been shown to reduce Aβ-induced toxicity; however, due to its low bioavailability, clinical trials showed no remarkable effect on cognitive function. As a result, GT863, a derivative of curcumin with higher bioavailability, was synthesized. The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism of the protective action of GT863 against the neurotoxicity of highly toxic Aβ oligomers (Aβo), which include high-molecular-weight (HMW) Aβo, mainly composed of protofibrils in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, focusing on the cell membrane.

Levels of Soluble Interleukin 6 Receptor and Asp358Ala Are Associated With Cognitive Performance and Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease process manifesting clinically with cognitive impairment and dementia. AD pathology is complex, and in addition to plaques and tangles, neuroinflammation is a consistent feature. Interleukin (IL) 6 is a multifaceted cytokine involved in a plethora of cellular mechanisms including both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory processes. IL6 can signal classically through the membrane-bound receptor or by IL6 trans-signaling forming a complex with the soluble IL6 receptor (sIL6R) and activating membrane-bound glycoprotein 130 on cells not expressing IL6R. IL6 trans-signaling has been demonstrated as the primary mechanism of IL6-mediated events in neurodegenerative processes.

Yet, their cost and perceived invasiveness are a limitation for large-scale implementation. Based on positive amyloid profiles, blood-based biomarkers should allow to detect people at risk for AD and to monitor patients under therapeutics strategies.

Predicting amyloid PET and tau PET stages with plasma biomarkers.,"Staging the severity of Alzheimer's disease pathology using biomarkers is useful for therapeutic trials and clinical prognosis. Disease staging with amyloid and tau PET has face validity; however, this would be more practical with plasma biomarkers. Our objectives were, first, to examine approaches for staging amyloid and tau PET and, second, to examine prediction of amyloid and tau PET stages using plasma biomarkers. Participants (n = 1136) were enrolled in either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center; had a concurrent amyloid PET, tau PET and blood draw; and met clinical criteria for cognitively unimpaired (n = 864), mild cognitive impairment (n = 148) or Alzheimer's clinical syndrome with dementia (n = 124). The latter two groups were combined into a cognitively impaired group (n = 272). We used multinomial regression models to estimate discrimination [concordance (C) statistics] among three amyloid PET stages (low, intermediate, high), four tau PET stages (Braak 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6) and a combined amyloid and tau PET stage (none/low versus intermediate/high severity) using plasma biomarkers as predictors separately within unimpaired and impaired individuals. Plasma analytes, p-tau181, Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 (analysed as the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain were measured on the HD-X Simoa Quanterix platform. Plasma p-tau217 was also measured in a subset (n = 355) of cognitively unimpaired participants using the Lilly Meso Scale Discovery assay. Models with all Quanterix plasma analytes along with risk factors (age, sex and APOE) most often provided the best discrimination among amyloid PET stages (C = 0.78-0.82). Models with p-tau181 provided similar discrimination of tau PET stages to models with all four plasma analytes (C = 0.72-0.85 versus C = 0.73-0.86). Discriminating a PET proxy of intermediate/high from none/low Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change with all four Quanterix plasma analytes was excellent but not better than p-tau181 only (C = 0.88 versus 0.87 for unimpaired and C = 0.91 versus 0.90 for impaired). Lilly p-tau217 outperformed the Quanterix p-tau181 assay for discriminating high versus intermediate amyloid (C = 0.85 versus 0.74) but did not improve over a model with all Quanterix plasma analytes and risk factors (C = 0.85 versus 0.83). Plasma analytes along with risk factors can discriminate between amyloid and tau PET stages and between a PET surrogate for intermediate/high versus none/low neuropathological change with accuracy in the acceptable to excellent range. Combinations of plasma analytes are better than single analytes for many staging predictions with the exception that Quanterix p-tau181 alone usually performed equivalently to combinations of Quanterix analytes for tau PET discrimination.",2023,Alzheimer’s biomarkers; amyloid PET; plasma biomarkers; staging Alzheimer’s disease; tau PET,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Biomarkers; Aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Jack, CR; Wiste, HJ; Algeciras-Schimnich, A; Figdore, DJ; Schwarz, CG; Lowe, VJ; Ramanan, VK; Vemuri, P; Mielke, MM; Knopman, DS; Graff-Radford, J; Boeve, BF; Kantarci, K; Cogswell, PM; Senjem, ML; Gunter, JL; Therneau, TM; Petersen, RC"
Plasma extracellular vesicles reveal early molecular differences in amyloid positive patients with early-onset mild cognitive impairment.,"In the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) development, the dementia phase is commonly preceded by a prodromal AD phase, which is mainly characterized by reaching the highest levels of Aβ and p-tau-mediated neuronal injury and a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) clinical status. Because of that, most AD cases are diagnosed when neuronal damage is already established and irreversible. Therefore, a differential diagnosis of MCI causes in these prodromal stages is one of the greatest challenges for clinicians. Blood biomarkers are emerging as desirable tools for pre-screening purposes, but the current results are still being analyzed and much more data is needed to be implemented in clinical practice. Because of that, plasma extracellular vesicles (pEVs) are gaining popularity as a new source of biomarkers for the early stages of AD development. To identify an exosome proteomics signature linked to prodromal AD, we performed a cross-sectional study in a cohort of early-onset MCI (EOMCI) patients in which 184 biomarkers were measured in pEVs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma samples using multiplex PEA technology of Olink",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Extracellular vesicles; Mild cognitive impairment; Plasma exosomes; Proteomics,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cross-Sectional Studies; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Extracellular Vesicles; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments,"Cano, A; Esteban-de-Antonio, E; Bernuz, M; Puerta, R; García-González, P; de Rojas, I; Olivé, C; Pérez-Cordón, A; Montrreal, L; Núñez-Llaves, R; Sotolongo-Grau, Ó; Alarcón-Martín, E; Valero, S; Alegret, M; Martín, E; Martino-Adami, PV; Ettcheto, M; Camins, A; Vivas, A; Gomez-Chiari, M; Tejero, MÁ; Orellana, A; Tárraga, L; Marquié, M; Ramírez, A; Martí, M; Pividori, MI; Boada, M; Ruíz, A"
APOE differentially moderates cerebrospinal fluid and plasma phosphorylated tau181 associations with multi-domain cognition.,"Biofluid markers of phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) are increasingly popular for the detection of early Alzheimer's pathologic changes. However, the differential dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma p-tau181 remain under investigation. We studied 727 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with plasma and CSF p-tau181 data, apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 carrier status, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and neuropsychological data. Higher levels of plasma and CSF p-tau181 were observed among APOE ε4 carriers. CSF and plasma p-tau181 were significantly associated with memory, and this effect was greater in APOE ε4 carriers. However, whereas CSF p-tau181 was not significantly associated with language or attention/executive function among ε4 carriers or non-carriers, APOE ε4 status moderated the association of plasma p-tau181 with both language and attention/executive function. These findings lend support to the notion that p-tau181 biofluid markers are useful in measuring AD pathologic changes but also suggest that CSF and plasma p-tau181 have unique properties and dynamics that should be considered when using these markers in research and clinical practice.",2023,Apolipoprotein E; Cerebrospinal fluid; Cognition; Phosphorylated tau; Plasma,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E4; Biomarkers; Cognition; tau Proteins,"Weigand, AJ; Ortiz, G; Walker, KS; Galasko, DR; Bondi, MW; Thomas, KR"

Aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,"Aducanumab is a novel disease-modifying anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) human monoclonal antibody specifically targeted to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was granted for treating AD in June 2021 by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We systematically analyzed available trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab treating AD. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. We conducted an extensive literature search using the electronic databases MEDLINE through PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for suitable studies on aducanumab. We considered human clinical trials of aducanumab, assessing its efficacy and adverse effects in treating AD, excluding any experimental animal studies. We included three randomised controlled trials. Studies reported that aducanumab reduced brain amyloid-beta plaques in a time- and dose-dependent manner (dose-response, P < 0.05) and a slowed decline in cognition (22% reduction) in the high-dose treated group, difference of -0.39 versus placebo in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum Boxes (95% CI, -0.69 to -0.09; P = 0.012) along with a reduced amyloid positron emission tomography standard uptake value ratio score (P < 0.001) and plasma p181-tau (phosphorylated tau) level. Amyloid-related imaging abnormality was reported as a serious adverse event and was profound in high-dose treated group (425/1029 in 10 mg/kg).

miRNAs and Alzheimer's Disease: Exploring the Role of Inflammation and Vitamin E in an Old-Age Population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia worldwide and represents one of the leading factors for severe disability in older persons. Although its etiology is not fully known yet, AD may develop due to multiple factors, including inflammation and oxidative stress, conditions where microRNAs (miRNAs) seem to play a pivotal role as a molecular switch. All these aspects may be modulated by nutritional factors. Among them, vitamin E has been widely studied in AD, given the plausibility of its various biological functions in influencing neurodegeneration. From a cohort of old-aged people, we measured eight vitamin E forms (tocopherols and tocotrienols), thirty cytokines/chemokines, and thirteen exosome-extracted miRNAs in plasma of subjects suffering from subjects affected by AD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). The sample population included 80 subjects (40 AD and 40 HC) with a mean age of 77.6 ± 3.8 years, mostly women (45; 56.2%). Of the vitamin E forms, only α-tocopherol differed between groups, with significantly lower levels in AD. Regarding the examined inflammatory molecules, G-CSF, GM-CSF, INF-α2, IL-3, and IL-8 were significantly higher and IL-17 lower in AD than HC. Among all miRNAs examined, AD showed downregulation of miR-9, miR-21, miR29-b, miR-122, and miR-132 compared to controls. MiR-122 positively and significantly correlated with some inflammatory molecules (GM-CSF, INF-α2, IL-1α, IL-8, and MIP-1β) as well as with α-tocopherol even after correction for age and gender. A final binary logistic regression analysis showed that α-tocopherol serum levels were associated with a higher AD probability and partially mediated by miR-122. Our results suggest an interplay between α-tocopherol, inflammatory molecules, and microRNAs in AD, where miR-122 may be a good candidate as modulating factor.",2023,aging; inflammation; miRNAs; oxidative stress; vitamin E,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; alpha-Tocopherol; Alzheimer Disease; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Inflammation; Interleukin-8; MicroRNAs; Vitamin E","Boccardi, V; Poli, G; Cecchetti, R; Bastiani, P; Scamosci, M; Febo, M; Mazzon, E; Bruscoli, S; Brancorsini, S; Mecocci, P"
Cyclic Glycine-Proline (cGP) Normalises Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) Function: Clinical Significance in the Ageing Brain and in Age-Related Neurological Conditions.,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) function declines with age and is associated with brain ageing and the progression of age-related neurological conditions. The reversible binding of IGF-1 to IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 regulates the amount of bioavailable, functional IGF-1 in circulation. Cyclic glycine-proline (cGP), a metabolite from the binding site of IGF-1, retains its affinity for IGFBP-3 and competes against IGF-1 for IGFBP-3 binding. Thus, cGP and IGFBP-3 collectively regulate the bioavailability of IGF-1. The molar ratio of cGP/IGF-1 represents the amount of bioavailable and functional IGF-1 in circulation. The cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio is low in patients with age-related conditions, including hypertension, stroke, and neurological disorders with cognitive impairment. Stroke patients with a higher cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio have more favourable clinical outcomes. The elderly with more cGP have better memory retention. An increase in the cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio with age is associated with normal cognition, whereas a decrease in this ratio with age is associated with dementia in Parkinson disease. In addition, cGP administration reduces systolic blood pressure, improves memory, and aids in stroke recovery. These clinical and experimental observations demonstrate the role of cGP in regulating IGF-1 function and its potential clinical applications in age-related brain diseases as a plasma biomarker for-and an intervention to improve-IGF-1 function.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; ageing brain; cyclic glycine-proline (cGP); insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) function; stroke,Humans; Aged; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Clinical Relevance; Nervous System Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Stroke; Brain; Aging,"Guan, J; Li, F; Kang, D; Anderson, T; Pitcher, T; Dalrymple-Alford, J; Shorten, P; Singh-Mallah, G"

A Combination of Caffeine Supplementation and Enriched Environment in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,"A variety of factors has been associated with healthy brain aging, and epidemiological studies suggest that physical activity and nutritional supplements such as caffeine may reduce the risk of developing dementia and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease (AD) in later life. Caffeine is known to act as a cognitive enhancer but has been also shown to positively affect exercise performance in endurance activities. We have previously observed that chronic oral caffeine supplementation and a treatment paradigm encompassing physical and cognitive stimulation by enriched environment (EE) housing can improve learning and memory performance and ameliorate hippocampal neuron loss in the Tg4-42 mouse model of AD. Here, we investigated whether these effects were synergistic. To that end, previous findings on individual treatments were complemented with unpublished, additional data and analyzed in depth by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison post tests. We further evaluated whether plasma neurofilament light chain levels reflect neuropathological and behavioral changes observed in the experimental groups. While a treatment combining physical activity and caffeine supplementation significantly improved learning and memory function compared to standard-housed vehicle-treated Tg4-42 in tasks such as the Morris water maze, no major additive effect outperforming the effects of the single interventions was observed.",2023,Alzheimer’ disease; Aβ4-42; amyloid-β; behavior; caffeine; neuron loss; physical activity; transgenic mice,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Caffeine; Mice, Transgenic; Memory; Maze Learning; Disease Models, Animal; Dietary Supplements; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Stazi, M; Zampar, S; Klafki, HW; Meyer, T; Wirths, O"

The typical clinical manifestation of AD is progressive memory impairment, and AD is considered a multifactorial disease with various etiologies (genetic factors, aging, lifestyle, etc.) and complicated pathophysiological processes. Previous research identified that neuroinflammation and typical microglial activation are significant mechanisms underlying AD, resulting in dysfunction of the nervous system and progression of the disease. Ferroptosis is a novel modality involved in this process. As an iron-dependent form of cell death, ferroptosis, characterized by iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and irreversible plasma membrane disruption, promotes AD by accelerating neuronal dysfunction and abnormal microglial activation. In this case, disturbances in brain iron homeostasis and neuronal ferroptosis aggravate neuroinflammation and lead to the abnormal activation of microglia. Abnormally activated microglia release various pro-inflammatory factors that aggravate the dysregulation of iron homeostasis and neuroinflammation, forming a vicious cycle. In this review, we first introduce ferroptosis, microglia, AD, and their relationship. Second, we discuss the nonnegligible role of ferroptosis in the abnormal microglial activation involved in the chronic neuroinflammation of AD to provide new ideas for the identification of potential therapeutic targets for AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Ferroptosis; Iron metabolism; Microglia; Neuroinflammation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Microglia; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Ferroptosis,"Wang, M; Tang, G; Zhou, C; Guo, H; Hu, Z; Hu, Q; Li, G"
Genetic models of cleavage-reduced and soluble TREM2 reveal distinct effects on myelination and microglia function in the cuprizone model.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a cell-surface immunoreceptor expressed on microglia, osteoclasts, dendritic cells and macrophages. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, including mutations enhancing shedding form the cell surface, have been associated with myelin/neuronal loss and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer`s disease and Frontotemporal Dementia. Using the cuprizone model, we investigated the involvement of soluble and cleavage-reduced TREM2 on central myelination processes in cleavage-reduced (TREM2-IPD), soluble-only (TREM2-sol), knockout (TREM2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. The TREM2-sol mouse is a new model with selective elimination of plasma membrane TREM2 and a reduced expression of soluble TREM2. In the acute cuprizone model demyelination and remyelination events were reflected by a T2-weighted signal intensity change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), most prominently in the external capsule (EC). In contrast to WT and TREM2-IPD, TREM2-sol and TREM2-KO showed an additional increase in MRI signal during the recovery phase. Histological analyses of TREM2-IPD animals revealed no recovery of neuroinflammation as well as of the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 and displayed enhanced cytokine/chemokine levels in the brain. TREM2-sol and, to a much lesser extent, TREM2-KO, however, despite presenting reduced levels of some cytokines/chemokines, showed persistent microgliosis and astrocytosis during recovery, with both homeostatic (TMEM119) as well as activated (LAMP-1) microglia markers increased. This was accompanied, specifically in the EC, by no myelin recovery, with appearance of myelin debris and axonal pathology, while oligodendrocytes recovered. In the chronic model consisting of 12-week cuprizone administration followed by 3-week recovery TREM2-IPD displayed sustained microgliosis and enhanced remyelination in the recovery phase. Taken together, our data suggest that sustained microglia activation led to increased remyelination, whereas microglia without plasma membrane TREM2 and only soluble TREM2 had reduced phagocytic activity despite efficient lysosomal function, as observed in bone marrow-derived macrophages, leading to a dysfunctional phenotype with improper myelin debris removal, lack of remyelination and axonal pathology following cuprizone intoxication.",2023,Cuprizone; MRI; Microglia; Neuroinflammation; Phagocytosis; TREM2,"Animals; Mice; Cuprizone; Cytokines; Demyelinating Diseases; Disease Models, Animal; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Microglia; Models, Genetic; Myelin Sheath; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Receptors, Immunologic","Beckmann, N; Neuhaus, A; Zurbruegg, S; Volkmer, P; Patino, C; Joller, S; Feuerbach, D; Doelemeyer, A; Schweizer, T; Rudin, S; Neumann, U; Berth, R; Frieauff, W; Gasparini, F; Shimshek, DR"

Stroke and Vascular Cognitive Impairment: The Role of Intestinal Microbiota Metabolite TMAO.,"The gut microbiome interacts with the brain bidirectionally through the microbiome-gutbrain axis, which plays a key role in regulating various nervous system pathophysiological processes. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is produced by choline metabolism through intestinal microorganisms, which can cross the blood-brain barrier to act on the central nervous system. Previous studies have shown that elevated plasma TMAO concentrations increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but there are few studies on TMAO in cerebrovascular disease and vascular cognitive impairment. This review summarized a decade of research on the impact of TMAO on stroke and related cognitive impairment, with particular attention to the effects on vascular cognitive disorders. We demonstrated that TMAO has a marked impact on the occurrence, development, and prognosis of stroke by regulating cholesterol metabolism, foam cell formation, platelet hyperresponsiveness and thrombosis, and promoting inflammation and oxidative stress. TMAO can also influence the cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease via inducing abnormal aggregation of key proteins, affecting inflammation and thrombosis. However, although clinical studies have confirmed the association between the microbiome-gut-brain axis and vascular cognitive impairment (cerebral small vessel disease and post-stroke cognitive impairment), the molecular mechanism of TMAO has not been clarified, and TMAO precursors seem to play the opposite role in the process of poststroke cognitive impairment. In addition, several studies have also reported the possible neuroprotective effects of TMAO. Existing therapies for these diseases targeted to regulate intestinal flora and its metabolites have shown good efficacy. TMAO is probably a new target for early prediction and treatment of stroke and vascular cognitive impairment.",2024,Gut microbiome; TMAO; dementia; post-stroke cognitive impairment; stroke; vascular cognitive impairment,Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Stroke; Inflammation; Cognitive Dysfunction; Thrombosis; Choline,"Tu, R; Xia, J"

Plasma proteins related to inflammatory diet predict future cognitive impairment.,"Dysregulation of the immune system and dietary patterns that increase inflammation can increase the risk for cognitive decline, but the mechanisms by which inflammatory nutritional habits may affect the development of cognitive impairment in aging are not well understood. To determine whether plasma proteins linked to inflammatory diet predict future cognitive impairment, we applied high-throughput proteomic assays to plasma samples from a subset (n = 1528) of Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) participants (mean [SD] baseline age, 71.3 [SD 3.8] years). Results provide insights into how inflammatory nutritional patterns are associated with an immune-related proteome and identify a group of proteins (CXCL10, CCL3, HGF, OPG, CDCP1, NFATC3, ITGA11) related to future cognitive impairment over a 14-year follow-up period. Several of these inflammatory diet proteins were also associated with dementia risk across two external cohorts (ARIC, ESTHER), correlated with plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (Aβ",2023,,"Humans; Female; Aged; Proteomics; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diet; Blood Proteins; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cell Adhesion Molecules","Duggan, MR; Butler, L; Peng, Z; Daya, GN; Moghekar, A; An, Y; Rapp, SR; Hayden, KM; Shadyab, AH; Natale, G; Liu, L; Snetselaar, L; Moaddel, R; Rebholz, CM; Sullivan, K; Ballantyne, CM; Resnick, SM; Ferrucci, L; Walker, KA"
Bringing to light the physiological and pathological firing patterns of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons using optical recordings.,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a promising approach to study neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Most methods to record the activity of these cells have major drawbacks as they are invasive or they do not allow single cell resolution. Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) open the path to high throughput visualization of undisturbed neuronal activity. However, conventional GEVIs perturb membrane integrity through inserting multiple copies of transmembrane domains into the plasma membrane. To circumvent large add-ons to the plasma membrane, we used a minimally invasive novel hybrid dark quencher GEVI to record the physiological and pathological firing patterns of hiPSCs-derived sensory neurons from patients with inherited erythromelalgia, a chronic pain condition associated with recurrent attacks of redness and swelling in the distal extremities. We observed considerable differences in action potential firing patterns between patient and control neurons that were previously overlooked with other recording methods. Our system also performed well in hiPSC-derived forebrain neurons where it detected spontaneous synchronous bursting behavior, thus opening the path to future applications in other cell types and disease models including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, conditions associated with disturbances of neuronal activity and synchrony.",2022,GABA; action potential firing patterns; co-cultures; dark quencher genetically encoded voltage indicator; glutamate; iPSC-derived sensory neurons; inherited erythromelalgia; synchronous burst firing,,"Alich, TC; Röderer, P; Szalontai, B; Golcuk, K; Tariq, S; Peitz, M; Brüstle, O; Mody, I"

Such characteristics make them attractive in the research of biomarkers for age-related pathological conditions. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to examine the changes in EV concentration and size in the context of frailty, a geriatric syndrome associated with a progressive physical and cognitive decline. Specifically, total EVs and neural and microglial-derived EVs (NDVs and MDVs respectively) were investigated in plasma of frail and non-frail controls (CTRL), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.

ADAMTS4 is involved in the production of the Alzheimer disease amyloid biomarker APP669-711.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain parenchyma is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). We have previously identified amyloid precursor protein (APP)669-711 (a.k.a. Aβ(-3)-40) in human plasma using immunoprecipitation combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IP-MALDI-MS). Furthermore, we found that the level of a composite biomarker, i.e., a combination of APP669-711/Aβ1-42 ratio and Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42 ratio in human plasma, correlates with the amyloid PET status of AD patients. However, the production mechanism of APP669-711 has remained unclear. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we identified A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with a Thrombospondin type 1 motif, type 4 (ADAMTS4) as a responsible enzyme for APP669-711 production. ADAMTS4 cleaves APP directly to generate the C-terminal stub c102, which is subsequently proteolyzed by γ-secretase to release APP669-711. Genetic knockout of ADAMTS4 reduced the production of endogenous APP669-711 by 30% to 40% in cultured cells as well as mouse plasma, irrespectively of Aβ levels. Finally, we found that the endogenous murine APP669-711/Aβ1-42 ratio was increased in aged AD model mice, which shows Aβ deposition as observed in human patients. These data suggest that ADAMTS4 is involved in the production of APP669-711, and a plasma biomarker determined by IP-MALDI-MS can be used to estimate the level of Aβ deposition in the brain of mouse models.",2023,,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Biomarkers; ADAMTS4 Protein","Matsuzaki, M; Yokoyama, M; Yoshizawa, Y; Kaneko, N; Naito, H; Kobayashi, H; Korenaga, A; Sekiya, S; Ikemura, K; Opoku, G; Hirohata, S; Iwamoto, S; Tanaka, K; Tomita, T"
Behavioral and cognitive performance of humanized APOEε3/ε3 liver mice in relation to plasma apolipoprotein E levels.,"Plasma apolipoprotein E levels were previously associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), levels of cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, cognition and imaging brain measures. Outside the brain, the liver is the primary source of apoE and liver transplantation studies have demonstrated that liver-derived apoE does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. How hepatic apoE may be implicated in behavioral and cognitive performance is not clear. In the current study, we behaviorally tested FRGN mice with humanized liver harboring the ε3/ε3 genotype (E3-human liver (HL)) and compared their behavioral and cognitive performance with that of age-matched ε3/ε3 targeted replacement (E3-TR) mice, the latter produces human apoE3 throughout the body whereas the E3-HL mice endogenously produce human apoE3 only in the liver. We also compared the liver weights and plasma apoE levels, and assessed whether plasma apoE levels were correlated with behavioral or cognitive measures in both models. E3-HL were more active but performed cognitively worse than E3-TR mice. E3-HL mice moved more in the open field containing objects, showed higher activity levels in the Y maze, showed higher activity levels during the baseline period in the fear conditioning test than E3-TR mice, and swam faster than E3-TR mice during training to locate the visible platform in the water maze. However, E3-HL mice showed reduced spatial memory retention in the water maze and reduced fear learning and contextual and cued fear memory than E3-TR mice. Liver weights were greater in E3-HL than E3-TR mice and sex-dependent only in the latter model. Plasma apoE3 levels were similar to those found in humans and comparable in female and male E3-TR mice but higher in female E3-HL mice. Finally, we found correlations between plasma apoE levels and behavioral and cognitive measures which were predominantly model-dependent. Our study demonstrates mouse-model dependent associations between plasma apoE levels, behavior and cognition in an 'AD-neutral' setting and suggests that a humanized liver might be sufficient to induce mouse behavioral and cognitive phenotypes.",2023,,Female; Male; Animals; Humans; Mice; Apolipoprotein E3; Liver; Apolipoproteins E; Cognition; Brain; Alzheimer Disease,"Kessler, K; Giannisis, A; Bial, G; Foquet, L; Nielsen, HM; Raber, J"
Focused Ultrasound-mediated Liquid Biopsy in a Tauopathy Mouse Model.,"Background Neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer disease) characterized by the deposition of various pathogenic forms of tau protein in the brain are collectively referred to as tauopathies. Identification of the molecular drivers and pathways of neurodegeneration is critical to individualized targeted treatment of these disorders. However, despite important advances in fluid biomarker detection, characterization of these molecular subtypes is limited by the blood-brain barrier. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and safety of focused ultrasound-mediated liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) in the detection of brain-derived protein biomarkers in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy (PS19 mice). Materials and Methods Sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating the cerebral hemisphere in 2-month-old PS19 and wild-type mice, followed by measurement of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (30 minutes after sonication in the sonobiopsy group). Next, spatially targeted sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating either the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus in 6-month-old PS19 mice. To detect changes in plasma neurofilament light chain (a biomarker of neurodegeneration) levels, blood samples were collected before and after sonication (15 and 45-60 minutes after sonication). Histologic staining was performed to evaluate tissue damage after sonobiopsy.

Blood-brain barrier opening of the default mode network in Alzheimer's disease with magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain but is also an important obstacle for the effective delivery of therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been shown to reversibly disrupt the BBB. However, treatment of diffuse regions across the brain along with the effect on Alzheimer's disease relevant pathology need to be better characterized. This study is an open-labelled single-arm trial (NCT04118764) to investigate the feasibility of modulating BBB permeability in the default mode network and the impact on cognition, amyloid and tau pathology as well as BBB integrity. Nine participants [mean age 70.2 ± 7.2 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 21.9] underwent three biweekly procedures with follow-up visits up to 6 months. The BBB permeability of the bilateral hippocampi, anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus was transiently increased without grade 3 or higher adverse events. Participants did not experience worsening trajectory of cognitive decline (ADAS-cog11, MMSE). Whole brain vertex-based analysis of the 18F-florbetaben PET imaging demonstrated clusters of modest SUVR reduction in the right parahippocampal and inferior temporal lobe.

Increase of ALCAM and VCAM-1 in the plasma predicts the Alzheimer's disease.,"Cell adhesion molecules (CAM) are crucial in several pathological inflammation processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their potential for clinical diagnostics remains unknown. The present investigation evaluated the clinical significance of ALCAM, VCAM-1, NCAM, and ICAM-1 levels in the plasma of participants with cognitive impairment (44 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 71 patients with Alzheimer's dementia, and 18 patients with other dementia) and 28 controls with normal cognitive ability. We also detected plasma levels of multiple inflammatory factors (IFN-gamma, IL-18, IL-1beta, IL-13, IL-8, IL-7, CCL11, MCP-1, TSLP, IL-10, BDNF, IL-17, IL-5, TREM-1) using Multiplex liquid chip and plasma levels of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 using liquid-phase flow cytometry (FCM). Our findings demonstrated a correlation of ALCAM and VCAM-1 with age, the severity of cognitive decline, and MTA, but no significant difference between groups for NCAM and ICAM-1. ALCAM and VCAM-1 both demonstrated a positive correlation with the degree of atrophy in the medial temporal lobe structure. Further analysis revealed no significant correlation in plasma between VCAM-1, ALCAM and Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42. Nevertheless, there was a significant correlation between VCAM-1, ALCAM and many inflammatory factors. Furthermore, the predictive value of ALCAM and VCAM-1 for AD was assessed using a multi-parameter regression model. ALCAM and VCAM-1 in combination with ApoE4, education, age, and MMSE could predict AD with high precision (AUC=0.891; AIC=146.9) without imaging diagnosis. ALCAM and VCAM-1 combination improved the predictive accuracy significantly. In a nutshell, these findings revealed ALCAM and VCAM-1 as reliable indicators of Alzheimer's disease.",2022,ALCAM (CD166); Alzheimer’s dementia; VCAM- 1; cell adhesion molecules; nomogram,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules,"Chen, J; Dai, AX; Tang, HL; Lu, CH; Liu, HX; Hou, T; Lu, ZJ; Kong, N; Peng, XY; Lin, KX; Zheng, ZD; Xu, SL; Ying, XF; Ji, XY; Pan, H; Wu, J; Zeng, X; Wei, NL"

Identification of Plasma Proteomic Biomarkers in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Plasma proteomic profiling may provide novel biomarkers for the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The early diagnosis of MCI still remains a challenging task due to its diverse origin. Currently, molecular approaches have been used to identify MCI diversified origin as its onset is governed by a variety of molecular changes. Therefore, we aimed to find out molecular alteration in plasma using proteomics in patients with MCI for early detection of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). To achieve this, we performed two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF/MS, which is used to analyze the differentially expressed proteins. In our study, we found three significantly altered proteins. Out of three differentially expressed proteins, one was downregulated and two were upregulated in MCI individuals as compared to control. Further, In silico analysis showed that identified proteins are involved in pathways such as complement and coagulation cascades, platelet activation and AD. STRING interaction network analysis revealed that the majority of proteins including apolipoprotein E (APO-E) have a common association with Transthyretin (TTR) and fibrinogen chain beta (FGB) protein. This suggests that APO-E, TTR and FGB are the key proteins with which other proteins interact to exert other biological functions. Conclusively, these proteins showing differential expression in the plasma might be used as a potent signature in blood for the diagnosis of MCI individuals.",2023,2D-gel electrophoresis; Biomarker; Diffusion tensor imaging; Mild cognitive impairment; Proteomics,,"Singh, V; Mishra, VN; Thakur, MK"

Assessment of Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers in Different Stages of Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary type of dementia, followed by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). They share some clinical characteristics, mainly at the early stages. So, the identification of early, specific, and minimally invasive biomarkers is required.

Plasma Concentrations of Neurofilament Light Chain Protein and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor as Consistent Biomarkers of Cognitive Impairment in Alcohol Use Disorder.,"For a long time, Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) were not considered a component in the etiology of dementia. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders introduced substance-induced neurocognitive disorders, incorporating this notion to clinical practice. However, detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative processes in SUD patients remain a major clinical challenge, especially when early diagnosis is required. In the present study, we aimed to investigate new potential biomarkers of neurodegeneration that could predict cognitive impairment in SUD patients: the circulating concentrations of Neurofilament Light chain protein (NfL) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Sixty SUD patients were compared with twenty-seven dementia patients and forty healthy controls. SUD patients were recruited and assessed using the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental (PRISM) and a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test for evaluation of cognitive impairment. When compared to healthy control subjects, SUD patients showed increases in plasma NfL concentrations and NfL/BDNF ratio, as well as reduced plasma BDNF levels. These changes were remarkable in SUD patients with moderate-severe cognitive impairment, being comparable to those observed in dementia patients. NfL concentrations correlated with executive function and memory cognition in SUD patients. The parameters ""age"", ""NfL/BDNF ratio"", ""first time alcohol use"", ""age of onset of alcohol use disorder"", and ""length of alcohol use disorder diagnosis"" were able to stratify our SUD sample into patients with cognitive impairment from those without cognitive dysfunction with great specificity and sensibility. In conclusion, we propose the combined use of NfL and BDNF (NfL/BDNF ratio) to monitor substance-induced neurocognitive disorder.",2023,addiction; alcohol use disorder; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; cognitive impairment; dementia; neurodegeneration; neurofilament light chain protein,Humans; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Alcoholism; Intermediate Filaments; Neurofilament Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease,"Requena-Ocaña, N; Araos, P; Serrano-Castro, PJ; Flores-López, M; García-Marchena, N; Oliver-Martos, B; Ruiz, JJ; Gavito, A; Pavón, FJ; Serrano, A; Mayoral, F; Suarez, J; Fonseca, FR"

Behavioral and Proteomic Studies Reveal Methylglyoxal Activate Pathways Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Diabetes is one of the major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. The role of elevated levels of glucose, methylglyoxal (MGO), and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the pathogenesis of AD is not well understood. In this pursuit, we studied the role of methylglyoxal in the pathogenesis of AD in rat models. The elevated plus-maze (EPM) behavioral study indicated that MGO induces anxiety. Treatment of telmisartan (RAGE expression inhibitor) and aminoguanidine (MGO quencher) attenuated MGO induced anxiety. Further, hippocampal proteomics demonstrated that MGO treated rats differentially regulate proteins involved in calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial functioning, and apoptosis, which may affect neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity. The hippocampal tau phosphorylation level was increased in MGO treated rats, which was reduced in the presence of aminoguanidine and telmisartan. The plasma fructosamine level was increased upon MGO treatment. Hippocampal histochemistry showed vascular degeneration and neuronal loss upon MGO treatment.

Dietary choline intake is necessary to prevent systems-wide organ pathology and reduce Alzheimer's disease hallmarks.,"There is an urgent need to identify modifiable environmental risk factors that reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The B-like vitamin choline plays key roles in body- and brain-related functions. Choline produced endogenously by the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase protein in the liver is not sufficient for adequate physiological functions, necessitating daily dietary intake. ~90% of Americans do not reach the recommended daily intake of dietary choline. Thus, it's imperative to determine whether dietary choline deficiency increases disease outcomes. Here, we placed 3xTg-AD, a model of AD, and non-transgenic (NonTg) control mice on either a standard laboratory diet with sufficient choline (ChN; 2.0 g/kg choline bitartrate) or a choline-deficient diet (Ch-; 0.0 g/kg choline bitartrate) from 3 to 12 (early to late adulthood) months of age. A Ch- diet reduced blood plasma choline levels, increased weight, and impaired both motor function and glucose metabolism in NonTg mice, with 3xTg-AD mice showing greater deficits. Tissue analyses showed cardiac and liver pathology, elevated soluble and insoluble Amyloid-β and Thioflavin S structures, and tau hyperphosphorylation at various pathological epitopes in the hippocampus and cortex of 3xTg-AD Ch- mice. To gain mechanistic insight, we performed unbiased proteomics of hippocampal and blood plasma samples. Dietary choline deficiency altered hippocampal networks associated with microtubule function and postsynaptic membrane regulation. In plasma, dietary choline deficiency altered protein networks associated with insulin metabolism, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and fructose metabolic processing. Our data highlight that dietary choline intake is necessary to prevent systems-wide organ pathology and reduce hallmark AD pathologies.",2023,aging; aldob; amyloid-beta; cardiac hypertrophy; choline; liver; motor function; tau pathogenesis,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Choline; Choline Deficiency; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mice, Transgenic; Eating; Disease Models, Animal; tau Proteins; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Dave, N; Judd, JM; Decker, A; Winslow, W; Sarette, P; Villarreal Espinosa, O; Tallino, S; Bartholomew, SK; Bilal, A; Sandler, J; McDonough, I; Winstone, JK; Blackwood, EA; Glembotski, C; Karr, T; Velazquez, R"

On the identification of hypoxic regions in subject-specific cerebral vasculature by combined CFD/MRI.,"A long-time exposure to lack of oxygen (hypoxia) in some regions of the cerebrovascular system is believed to be one of the causes of cerebral neurological diseases. In the present study, we show how a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can provide a non-invasive alternative for studying blood flow and transport of oxygen within the cerebral vasculature. We perform computer simulations of oxygen mass transfer in the subject-specific geometry of the circle of Willis. The computational domain and boundary conditions are based on four-dimensional (4D)-flow MRI measurements. Two different oxygen mass transfer models are considered: passive (where oxygen is treated as a dilute chemical species in plasma) and active (where oxygen is bonded to haemoglobin) models. We show that neglecting haemoglobin transport results in a significant underestimation of the arterial wall mass transfer of oxygen.

Plasma biomarker profiles in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"Emerging plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease might be non-invasive tools to trace early Alzheimer's disease-related abnormalities such as the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides, neurofibrillary tau tangles, glial activation and neurodegeneration. It is, however, unclear which pathological processes in the CNS can be adequately detected by peripheral measurements and whether plasma biomarkers are equally applicable in both clinical and preclinical phases. Here we aimed to explore the timing and performance of plasma biomarkers in mutation carriers compared to non-carriers in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Samples (n = 164) from mutation carriers (n = 33) and non-carriers (n = 42) in a Swedish cohort of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (APP p.KM670/671NL, APP p.E693G and PSEN1 p.H163Y) were included in explorative longitudinal analyses. Plasma phosphorylated tau (P-tau181), total tau (T-tau), neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentrations were measured with a single-molecule array method as previously described. Plasma biomarkers were additionally correlated to Alzheimer's disease core biomarkers in the CSF. Results from the longitudinal analyses confirmed that plasma P-tau181, NfL and GFAP concentrations were higher in mutation carriers compared to non-carriers. This change was observed in the presymptomatic phase and detectable first as an increase in GFAP approximately 10 years before estimated symptom onset, followed by increased levels of P-tau181 and NfL closer to expected onset. Plasma P-tau181 levels were correlated to levels of P-tau181 and T-tau in the CSF. Altogether, plasma P-tau181, GFAP and NfL seem to be feasible biomarkers to detect different Alzheimer's disease-related pathologies already in presymptomatic individuals. Interestingly, changes in plasma GFAP concentrations were detected prior to P-tau181 and NfL. Our results suggest that plasma GFAP might reflect Alzheimer's disease pathology upstream to accumulation of tangles and neurodegeneration. The implications of these findings need additional validation, in particular because of the limited sample size.",2023,autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neurofilament light chain; plasma biomarker; tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Genes, Dominant","Johansson, C; Thordardottir, S; Laffita-Mesa, J; Rodriguez-Vieitez, E; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Graff, C"
Impact of pre-analytical sample handling factors on plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"An unmet need exists for reliable plasma biomarkers of amyloid pathology, in the clinical laboratory setting, to streamline diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For routine clinical use, a biomarker must provide robust and reliable results under pre-analytical sample handling conditions.

Functional Correlates of Striatal Dopamine Transporter Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels in Alzheimer's Disease: A Preliminary ,"The aim of our study was to investigate regional glucose metabolism with 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography in a population of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in relation to cerebrospinal (CSF) levels of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT). All patients underwent lumbar puncture and received a biomarker-based diagnosis of AD. Differences in regional brain glucose metabolism were assessed by Statistical Parametric Mapping version 12 with the use of age, gender, and MMSE as covariates in the analysis. A positive correlation between CSF DAT levels and glucose metabolism at the level of two brain areas involved in the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease, the substantia nigra and the posterior cingulate gyrus, has been highlighted. Results indicate that patients with higher CSF DAT levels have a better metabolic pattern in two key zones, suggesting less advanced disease status in patients with more conserved dopaminergic systems.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; DAT; FDG-PET; dementia; dopaminergic impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Positron-Emission Tomography; Brain; Glucose,"Camedda, R; Bonomi, CG; Di Donna, MG; Chiaravalloti, A"

Neuronal deletion of nSMase2 reduces the production of Aβ and directly protects neurons.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been proposed to regulate the deposition of Aβ. Multiple publications have shown that APP, amyloid processing enzymes and Aβ peptides are associated with EVs. However, very little Aβ is associated with EVs compared with the total amount Aβ present in human plasma, CSF, or supernatants from cultured neurons. The involvement of EVs has largely been inferred by pharmacological inhibition or whole body deletion of the sphingomyelin hydrolase neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) that is a key regulator for the biogenesis of at-least one population of EVs. Here we used a Cre-Lox system to selectively delete nSMase2 from pyramidal neurons in APP/PS1 mice (APP/PS1-SMPD3-Nex1) and found a ∼ 70% reduction in Aβ deposition at 6 months of age and ∼ 35% reduction at 12 months of age in both cortex and hippocampus. Brain ceramides were increased in APP/PS1 compared with Wt mice, but were similar to Wt in APP/PS1-SMPD3-Nex1 mice suggesting that elevated brain ceramides in this model involves neuronally expressed nSMase2. Reduced levels of PSD95 and deficits of long-term potentiation in APP/PS1 mice were normalized in APP/PS1-SMPD3-Nex1 mice. In contrast, elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-8 and TNFα in APP/PS1 mice were not normalized in APP/PS1-SMPD3-Nex1 mice compared with APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistic studies showed that the size of liquid ordered membrane microdomains was increased in APP/PS1 mice, as were the amounts of APP and BACE1 localized to these microdomains. Pharmacological inhibition of nSMase2 activity with PDDC reduced the size of the liquid ordered membrane microdomains, reduced the localization of APP with BACE1 and reduced the production of Aβ",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-β; Ceramide; Extracellular vesicles (EVs); LTP; Long term potentiation; Sphingomyelinase; nSMase2,"Mice; Humans; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Mice, Transgenic; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neurons; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Presenilin-1; Disease Models, Animal; Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase","Tohumeken, S; Deme, P; Yoo, SW; Gupta, S; Rais, R; Slusher, BS; Haughey, NJ"
From Determining Brain Insulin Resistance in a Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease Model to Exploring the Region-Dependent Effect of Intranasal Insulin.,"Impaired response to insulin has been linked to many neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Animal model of sporadic AD has been developed by intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of streptozotocin (STZ), which given peripherally causes insulin resistance. Difficulty in demonstrating insulin resistance in this model led to our aim: to determine brain regional and peripheral response after intranasal (IN) administration of insulin in control and STZ-icv rats, by exploring peripheral and central metabolic parameters. One month after STZ-icv or vehicle-icv administration to 3-month-old male Wistar rats, cognitive status was determined after which rats received 2 IU of fast-acting insulin aspart intranasally (CTR + INS; STZ + INS) or saline only (CTR and STZ). Rats were sacrificed 2 h after administration and metabolic and glutamatergic parameters were measured in plasma, CSF, and the brain. Insulin and STZ increased amyloid-β concentration in plasma (CTR + INS and STZ vs CTR), while there was no effect on glucose and insulin plasma and CSF levels. INS normalized the levels of c-fos in temporal cortex of STZ + INS vs STZ (co-localized with neurons), while hypothalamic c-fos was found co-localized with the microglial marker. STZ and insulin brain region specifically altered the levels and activity of proteins involved in cell metabolism and glutamate signaling. Central changes found after INS in STZ-icv rats suggest hippocampal and cortical insulin sensitivity. Altered hypothalamic metabolic parameters of STZ-icv rats were not normalized by INS, indicating possible hypothalamic insulin insensitivity. Brain insulin sensitivity depends on the affected brain region and presence of metabolic dysfunction induced by STZ-icv administration.",2023,C-fos; Glutamate; Insulin resistance; Intranasal insulin; Streptozotocin,"Rats; Male; Animals; Insulin; Alzheimer Disease; Insulin Resistance; Rats, Wistar; Brain; Streptozocin; Disease Models, Animal; Maze Learning","Knezovic, A; Budisa, S; Babic Perhoc, A; Homolak, J; Osmanovic Barilar, J"

Although Aβ deposits have mostly been observed extracellularly, various studies have also reported the presence of intracellular Aβ assemblies. Because these intracellular Aβ aggregates might play a role in the onset and progression of AD, it is important to investigate their possible origins at different locations of the cell along the secretory pathway of the amyloid precursor protein, from which Aβ is derived by proteolytic cleavage.

Brain-derived tau: a novel blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration.,"Blood-based biomarkers for amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau show good diagnostic accuracies and agreements with their corresponding CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration [A/T/(N)] framework for Alzheimer's disease. However, the blood-based neurodegeneration marker neurofilament light is not specific to Alzheimer's disease while total-tau shows lack of correlation with CSF total-tau. Recent studies suggest that blood total-tau originates principally from peripheral, non-brain sources. We sought to address this challenge by generating an anti-tau antibody that selectively binds brain-derived tau and avoids the peripherally expressed 'big tau' isoform. We applied this antibody to develop an ultrasensitive blood-based assay for brain-derived tau, and validated it in five independent cohorts (n = 609) including a blood-to-autopsy cohort, CSF biomarker-classified cohorts and memory clinic cohorts. In paired samples, serum and CSF brain-derived tau were significantly correlated (rho = 0.85, P < 0.0001), while serum and CSF total-tau were not (rho = 0.23, P = 0.3364). Blood-based brain-derived tau showed equivalent diagnostic performance as CSF total-tau and CSF brain-derived tau to separate biomarker-positive Alzheimer's disease participants from biomarker-negative controls. Furthermore, plasma brain-derived tau accurately distinguished autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative diseases (area under the curve = 86.4%) while neurofilament light did not (area under the curve = 54.3%). These performances were independent of the presence of concomitant pathologies. Plasma brain-derived tau (rho = 0.52-0.67, P = 0.003), but not neurofilament light (rho = -0.14-0.17, P = 0.501), was associated with global and regional amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts. These results were further verified in two memory clinic cohorts where serum brain-derived tau differentiated Alzheimer's disease from a range of other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and atypical parkinsonian disorders (area under the curve up to 99.6%). Notably, plasma/serum brain-derived tau correlated with neurofilament light only in Alzheimer's disease but not in the other neurodegenerative diseases. Across cohorts, plasma/serum brain-derived tau was associated with CSF and plasma AT(N) biomarkers and cognitive function. Brain-derived tau is a new blood-based biomarker that outperforms plasma total-tau and, unlike neurofilament light, shows specificity to Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration. Thus, brain-derived tau demonstrates potential to complete the AT(N) scheme in blood, and will be useful to evaluate Alzheimer's disease-dependent neurodegenerative processes for clinical and research purposes.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; neurodegenerative disease; neurofilament light; plasma brain-derived-tau; total-tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Brain; Biomarkers,"Gonzalez-Ortiz, F; Turton, M; Kac, PR; Smirnov, D; Premi, E; Ghidoni, R; Benussi, L; Cantoni, V; Saraceno, C; Rivolta, J; Ashton, NJ; Borroni, B; Galasko, D; Harrison, P; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Karikari, TK"

The Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease: A Patient-Centred Conversation with the Care Team.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases, affecting approximately 10 million people in Europe. Neuroimaging techniques and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers used in combination with cognitive assessment tools open the door to early diagnosis of AD. However, these tools present some challenges that need to be overcome, such as low sensitivity or specificity, high cost, limited availability or invasiveness. Thus, low-cost and non-invasive alternatives, such as plasma biomarkers, have the potential to drive changes in AD screening and diagnosis. In addition to the technical aspects, organisational challenges as well as ethical concerns need to be addressed. In many countries, there is an insufficient number of specialists to recognise, evaluate and diagnose dementia and the waiting times to see a specialist are long. Given that there is currently no cure for AD, it is important to consider the potential psychological impact of an early diagnosis. In addition, counselling before biomarker sampling and during diagnosis disclosure is vital to guarantee that the patients have all the information necessary and their queries are addressed in a sensitive manner. Here, we illustrate (using a clinical vignette) current challenges of diagnosis and discuss some of the benefits and challenges of early diagnosis in AD including the value of biomarkers in combination with clinical evaluation. Lastly, some guidelines for disclosing early diagnosis of AD are provided based on our experiences.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; Cerebrospinal fluid; Early diagnosis; Neuroimaging; Patient management; Psychological impact of biomarker testing,,"Nasreddine, Z; Garibotto, V; Kyaga, S; Padovani, A"
Resistance to mild cold stress is greater in both wild-type and long-lived GHR-KO female mice.,"Adapting to stress, including cold environmental temperature (eT), is crucial for the survival of mammals, especially small rodents. Long-lived mutant mice have enhanced stress resistance against oxidative and non-oxidative challenges. However, much less is known about the response of those long-lived mice to cold stress. Growth hormone receptor knockout (GHR-KO) mice are long-lived with reduced growth hormone signaling. We wanted to test whether GHR-KO mice have enhanced resistance to cold stress. To examine the response of GHR-KO mice to cold eT, GHR-KO mice were housed at mild cold eT (16 °C) immediately following weaning. Longevity results showed that female GHR-KO and wild-type (WT) mice retained similar lifespan, while both male GHR-KO and WT mice had shortened lifespan compared to the mice housed at 23 °C eT. Female GHR-KO and WT mice housed at 16 °C had upregulated fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), enhanced energy metabolism, reduced plasma triglycerides, and increased mRNA expression of some xenobiotic enzymes compared to females housed at 23 °C and male GHR-KO and WT mice housed under the same condition. In contrast, male GHR-KO and WT mice housed at 16 °C showed deleterious effects in parameters which might be associated with their shortened longevity compared to male GHR-KO and WT mice housed at 23 °C. Together, this study suggests that in response to mild cold stress, sex plays a pivotal role in the regulation of longevity, and female GHR-KO and WT mice are more resistant to this challenge than the males.",2023,Cold stress; Energy metabolism; FGF21; GHR-KO mice; Longevity,"Female; Male; Mice; Animals; Receptors, Somatotropin; Mice, Knockout; Cold-Shock Response; Longevity; Signal Transduction; Mammals","Fang, Y; Medina, D; Stockwell, R; McFadden, S; Hascup, ER; Hascup, KN; Bartke, A"

TNFR-1 and GDF-15 Are Associated With Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain and Progranulin Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Secondary Analysis of the MAPT Study.,"There is growing evidence that cognitive decline can be affected by both nutritional aspects and inflammation. Plasma neurodegenerative biomarkers stand out as minimally invasive useful measures to monitor the potential risk of cognitive decline. This study aimed to investigate the associations between biomarkers of neurodegeneration, nutrition, and inflammation among community-dwelling older adults, and to verify if associations differed according to apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. This cross-sectional analysis included 475 participants ≥70 years old from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT), mean age 76.8 years (SD = 4.5), 59.4% women. Biomarkers of neurodegeneration (plasma amyloid-β 42/40-Aβ 42/40, neurofilament light chain-NfL, progranulin), nutrition (erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, omega-3 index; plasma homocysteine-Hcy, 25 hydroxyvitamin D), inflammation (plasma tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-TNFR-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-MCP-1, interleukin 6-IL-6), and cellular stress (plasma growth differentiation factor 15-GDF-15) were assessed. Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations between nutritional and inflammatory biomarkers (independent variables) and neurodegenerative biomarkers (dependent variables), with adjustments for age, sex, education, body mass index, physical activity, allocation to MAPT groups, and APOE ε4 status. After adjusting for confounders, Aβ 42/40 was not associated with nutritional or inflammatory markers. NfL was positively associated with GDF-15, TNFR-1, IL-6, and Hcy. Progranulin was positively associated with GDF-15, TNFR-1, and MCP-1. Analyses restricted to APOE ε4 carriers (n = 116; 26.9%) or noncarriers were mostly similar.

"Modeling digestion, absorption, and ketogenesis after administration of tricaprilin formulations to humans.","At present, tricaprilin is used as a ketogenic source for the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. After administration of the medium-chain triglyceride, tricaprilin is hydrolyzed to octanoic acid and further metabolized to ketones, acting as an alternative energy substrate for the brain. In this investigation, we developed a physiologically-based biopharmaceutics model simulating in vivo processes following the peroral administration of tricaprilin. The model includes multiple data sources to establish a partially verified framework for the simulation of plasma profiles. The input parameters were identified based on existing literature data and in vitro digestion studies. Model validation was conducted using the data from a phase I clinical trial. A partial parameter sensitivity analysis elucidated various influences on the plasma ketone levels that are mainly responsible for the therapeutic effects of tricaprilin. Based on our findings, we concluded that dispersibility and lipolysis of tricaprilin together with the gastric emptying patterns are limiting ketogenesis, while other steps such as the conversion of octanoic acid to ketone bodies play a minor role only.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; In vitro lipid digestion; Ketogenesis; Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling; Tricaprilin; medium-chain triglycerides MCTs,"Humans; Administration, Oral; Digestion; Ketone Bodies; Ketones; Triglycerides","Li, Z; Ramirez, G; Tang, R; Paul, CKX; Nair, M; Henderson, S; Morimoto, B; Liu, J; Kaasgaard, T; Boyd, BJ; Wacker, MG"

Trace elements and Alzheimer dementia in population-based studies: A bibliometric and meta-analysis.,"Alterations in the concentrations of trace elements may play a vital role in Alzheimer dementia progression. However, previous research results are inconsistent, and there is still a lack of review on the relationship between all the studied-trace elements and AD from various perspectives of population-based studies. In this study, we systematically reviewed previous population-based studies and identified the altered trace elements in AD patients. We searched the Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and Scopus database, and ultimately included 73 articles. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to explore the evolution of the field from an epidemiological perspective. Bibliometric data such as trace elements, biological materials, detection methods, cognitive tests, co-occurrence and co-citation statistics are all analyzed and presented in a quantitative manner. The 73 included studies analyzed 39 trace elements in total. In a further meta-analysis, standardized mean differences (SMDs) of 13 elements were calculated to evaluate their altered in AD patients, including copper, iron, zinc, selenium, manganese, lead, aluminum, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, mercury, cobalt, and manganese. We identified four trace elements-copper (serum), iron (plasma), zinc (hair), and selenium (plasma)-altered in AD patients, with SMDs of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10, 0.65), -0.68 (95% CI: -1.34, -0.02), -0.35 (95% CI: -0.62, -0.08), and -0.61 (95% CI: -0.97, -0.25), respectively.

"Thiazolidin-4-one prevents against memory deficits, increase in phosphorylated tau protein, oxidative damage and cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer disease model: Comparison with donepezil drug.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized mostly by memory decline. The current therapeutic arsenal for treating AD is limited, and the available drugs only produce symptomatic benefits, but do not stop disease progression. The search for effective therapeutic alternatives with multitarget actions is therefore imperative. One such a potential alternative is thiazolidin-4-one, a compound that exhibits anti-amnesic, anticholinesterase, and antioxidant activities. The aim of this study was evaluated the effects of 2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)- 3-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propyl) thiazolidin-4-one (DS12) on memory and neurochemical parameters in a model of AD induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Adult male rats were divided into five groups: I, control (saline); II, DS12 (10 mg/kg); III, STZ; IV, STZ + DS12 (10 mg/kg); V, STZ + donepezil (5 mg/kg). The rats were orally treated with DS12 and donepezil for a period of 20 days. Memory, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, phosphorylated tau protein levels and oxidative stress were analyzed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Biochemical and hematological parameters were evaluated in the blood and serum. Memory impairment and the increase in AChE activity and phosphorylated tau protein level induced by STZ were prevented by DS12 and donepezil treatment. Streptozotocin induces an increase in reactive oxygen species levels and a decrease in catalase activity in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. DS12 treatment conferred protection from oxidative alterations in all brain structures. No changes were observed in serum biochemical parameters (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid, and urea) or hematological parameters, such as platelets, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total plasma protein. DS12 improved memory and neurochemical changes in an AD model and did not show toxic effects, suggesting the promising therapeutic potential of this compound.",2023,Acetylcholinesterase; Alzheimer’s disease; Brain; Oxidative stress; Tau protein; Thiazolidin-4-ones,"Rats; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Donepezil; tau Proteins; Streptozocin; Acetylcholinesterase; Oxidative Stress; Memory Disorders; Antioxidants; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Disease Models, Animal; Maze Learning","Dos Santos, A; Teixeira, FC; da Silva, DS; Veleda, TA; de Mello, JE; Luduvico, KP; Tavares, RG; Stefanello, FM; Cunico, W; Spanevello, RM"

Association of homocysteine-related subcortical brain atrophy with white matter lesion volume and cognition in healthy aging.,"Homocysteine (Hcy) is a vascular risk factor associated with cognitive impairment and cerebrovascular disease but has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using multivariate Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) analysis, we sought to identify a network pattern in structural neuroimaging reflecting the regionally distributed association of plasma Hcy with subcortical gray matter (SGM) volumes and its relation to other health risk factors and cognition in 160 healthy older adults, ages 50-89. We identified an SSM Hcy-SGM pattern that was characterized by bilateral hippocampal and nucleus accumbens volume reductions with relative volume increases in bilateral caudate, pallidum, and putamen. Greater Hcy-SGM pattern expression was associated with greater white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, older age, and male sex, but not with other vascular and AD-related risk factors. Mediation analyses revealed that age predicted WMH volume, which predicted Hcy-SGM pattern expression, which, in turn, predicted cognitive processing speed performance.

Anti-HK antibody inhibits the plasma contact system by blocking prekallikrein and factor XI activation in vivo.,"A dysregulated plasma contact system is involved in various pathological conditions, such as hereditary angioedema, Alzheimer disease, and sepsis. We previously showed that the 3E8 anti-high molecular weight kininogen (anti-HK) antibody blocks HK cleavage and bradykinin generation in human plasma ex vivo. Here, we show that 3E8 prevented not only HK cleavage but also factor XI (FXI) and prekallikrein (PK) activation by blocking their binding to HK in mouse plasma in vivo. 3E8 also inhibited contact system-induced bradykinin generation in vivo. Interestingly, FXII activation was also inhibited, likely because of the ability of 3E8 to block the positive feedback activation of FXII by kallikrein (PKa). In human plasma, 3E8 also blocked PK and FXI binding to HK and inhibited both thrombotic (FXI activation) and inflammatory pathways (PK activation and HK cleavage) of the plasma contact system activation ex vivo. Moreover, 3E8 blocked PKa binding to HK and dose-dependently inhibited PKa cleavage of HK. Our results reveal a novel strategy to inhibit contact system activation in vivo, which may provide an effective method to treat human diseases involving contact system dysregulation.",2023,,"Humans; Animals; Mice; Prekallikrein; Factor XI; Bradykinin; Kininogen, High-Molecular-Weight; Thrombosis","Chen, ZL; Singh, PK; Horn, K; Calvano, MR; Kaneki, S; McCrae, KR; Strickland, S; Norris, EH"

Mass Spectrometry for the Advancement of Lipid Analysis in Alzheimer's Research.,"Recent technical advances in mass spectrometry, as applied to the analytical chemistry of lipid molecules, enable the simultaneous detection of the multiplicity of lipid complex species present in the human brain. This, in combination with quantitative studies carried out in plasma samples, helps to identify disease biomarkers including for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is particularly powerful for the anatomical localization of lipids in brain slices, identifying lipid modifications in postmortem frozen samples from AD patients.Human brain tissues are sectioned in a cryostat and then covered with a chemical matrix, such as mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), to ionize the lipid molecules either by sublimation or by spraying. We describe the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) in an LTQ-Orbitrap-XL mass spectrometer to scan brain tissue slices with high spatial resolution, analyzing 50 μm cell layers.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis of the Human Brain Sphingolipidome.,"In recent decades, mass spectrometry-based lipidomics has provided a fertile environment for scientific investigations of biochemical and mechanistic processes in biological systems. Notably, this approach has been used to characterize physiological and pathological processes relevant to the central nervous system by identifying changes in the sphingolipid content in the brain, cerebral spinal fluid, and blood plasma. However, despite a preponderance of studies identifying correlations between specific lipids and disease progression, this powerful resource has not yet substantively translated into clinically useful diagnostic assays. Part of this gap may be explained by insufficient depth of the lipidomic profiles in many studies, by lab-to-lab inconsistencies in methodology, and a lack of absolute quantification. These issues limit the identification of specific molecular species and the harmonization of results across independent studies. In this chapter, we contextualize these issues with recent reports identifying correlations between brain lipids and neurological diseases, and we describe the workflow our group has optimized for analysis of the blood plasma sphingolipidome, adapted to the characterization of the human brain tissue.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Brain; Clinical correlation; LC-MS/MS methodology; Lipidomics; Mass spectrometry; Neurological disease; Plasma; Sphingolipidomics; Sphingolipids; Sphingosine 1-Phosphate,Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Brain; Lipidomics; Sphingolipids; Workflow,"Chua, XY; Huang, R; Herr, D; Lai, MKP; Wenk, MR; Torta, F"
"Chronic, Mild Hypothermic Environmental Temperature Does Not Ameliorate Cognitive Deficits in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse.","Metabolic dysfunction increases with age and is a contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. We have previously observed impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in the APP/PS1 model of AD. To improve these parameters, we chronically exposed male and female mice to mild hypothermic environmental temperature (eT), which positively modulates metabolism. Although a hypothermic eT normalized insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance was still impaired in both sexes of AD mice. We observed increased plasma glucagon and B-cell activating factor in both sexes, but additional sexually dimorphic mechanisms may explain the impaired glucose homeostasis in AD mice. Hepatic Glut2 was decreased in females while visceral adipose tissue TNFα was increased in male APP/PS1 mice. A mild hypothermic eT did not improve spatial learning and memory in either sex and increased amyloid plaque burden in male APP/PS1 mice. Overall, plasma markers of glucose homeostasis and AD pathology were worse in females compared to male APP/PS1 mice suggesting a faster disease progression.

Periostin Plasma Levels and Changes on Physical and Cognitive Capacities in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.,"Periostin, involved in extracellular matrix development and support, has been shown to be elevated in senescent tissues and fibrotic states, transversal signatures of aging. We aimed to explore associations between plasma periostin and physical and cognitive capacity evolution among older adults. Our hypothesis was that higher levels of plasma periostin will be associated with worse physical and mental capacities along time. Analyses included 1 096 participants (mean age = 75.3 years ± 4.4; 63.9% women) from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial. Periostin levels (pg/mL) were measured in plasma collected at year 1. Periostin was used in continuous variable, and as a dichotomous variable highest quartile (POSTN+) versus lowest 3 quartiles (POSTN-) were used. Outcomes were measured annually over 4 years and included: gait speed (GS), short physical performance battery (SPPB) score, 5-times sit-to-stand test (5-STS), and handgrip strength (HS) as physical and cognitive composite z-score (CCS) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as cognitive endpoints. Plasma periostin as a continuous variable was associated with the worsening of physical and cognitive capacities over 4 years of follow-up, specifically the SPPB score, the 5-STS, and CCS in full-adjusted models. POSTN+ was associated with worse evolution in the physical (GS: [β = -0.057, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.101, -0.013], SPPB score [β = -0.736, 95% CI = -1.091, -0.381], 5-STS [β = 1.681, 95% CI = 0.801, 2.561]) as well as cognitive (CCS [β = -0.215, 95% CI = -0.335, -0.094]) domains compared to POSTN- group. No association was found with HS or the MMSE score. Our study showed for the first time that increased plasma periostin levels were associated with declines in both physical and cognitive capacities in older adults over a 4-year follow-up. Further research is needed to evaluate whether periostin might be used as a predictive biomarker of functional decline at an older age.",2023,Aging biomarker; Extracellular matrix; Healthy aging,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Hand Strength; Independent Living,"Sánchez-Sánchez, JL; Ader, I; Jeanson, Y; Planat-Benard, V; Vellas, B; Casteilla, L; de Souto-Barreto, P"

Can dementia risk be reduced by following the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7? A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to quantify the relationships between the American Heart Association (AHA) Cardiovascular Health (CVH) metrics, namely AHA Life's Simple 7, and cognitive outcomes. We searched PubMed and Embase (January 1, 2010-August 24, 2022) and finally included 14 longitudinal studies (311654 participants with 8006 incident dementia cases). Random-effects meta-analysis and one-stage linear mixed-effects models were performed. Increased CVH score seemed to associate with decreased risk of incident dementia in a linear manner, but this relationship varied by the measurement age of CVH metrics. That is, midlife CVH tended to have a linear association with late-life dementia risk, whereas a J-shaped association was observed between the late-life CVH score and dementia. In addition, late-life dementia risk was reduced significantly if individuals maintained an ideal level of AHA's CVH guidelines of physical activity, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, and smoking. However, our meta-analysis did not show a significant association between CVH score and global cognitive decline rate. Following AHA's CVH guidelines and maintaining CVH at an optimal level would substantially reduce the late-life dementia risk. More research is required to explore the link between a favorable CVH score and cognitive trajectories among cognitively asymptomatic older populations.",2023,Cardiovascular health; Dementia; Global cognitive function; Life’s Simple 7; Meta-analysis,Humans; American Heart Association; Risk Factors; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Health Status,"Wu, J; Xiong, Y; Xia, X; Orsini, N; Qiu, C; Kivipelto, M; Rizzuto, D; Wang, R"

Dysfunction of norepinephrine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's dementia - A review with meta-analysis.,"Some studies point locus coeruleus cell loss, the central nervous system main source of norepinephrine, to be one of the earliest neuropathological events of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are conflicting reports regarding the level of norepinephrine and its metabolites (3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) and 3,4 -dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL)) in AD patients. Uncover these alterations may be a key factor for understanding cognitive deficits and AD pathology. We review the literature that compare norepinephrine and its metabolites between AD patients and non-demented controls. A meta-analysis did not reveal significant statistical differences, but there was a trend towards a lower level of norepinephrine of AD, with almost no difference in MHPG in the cerebrospinal fluid. Regarding MHPG in plasma, DHPG and DOPEGAL we only performed a qualitative analyse due to the small or absent number of studies. These findings point to a decrease in norepinephrine, what is in line with locus coeluleus cell loss in AD. The absence of statistical difference and an equal level of MHGP could indicate a compensatory mechanism.",2023,"3,4 -dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL); 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG); 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG); Alzheimer disease; Catecholamine; Dementia; Meta-analysis; Norepinephrine",Humans; Norepinephrine; Methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol; Alzheimer Disease,"Portela Moreira, I; Henriques, T; Vieira-Coelho, MA; Guimarães, J"
Plasma Exchange in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has traditionally been used to selectively remove pathologic contents including autoantibodies, abnormal proteins, immune complexes, or toxins from a patient's plasma. In addition to the removal of molecular contributors to disease, fluid replacement and infusion of beneficial plasma constituents including albumin can be tapered based on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the offending disease. This treatment modality has shown efficacy in symptomatic relief and slowing of disease progression for various neurologic, immunologic, and hematologic diseases. This review outlines the rationale for TPE in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through a potential mechanism leveraging the concentration gradient of amyloid β peptides and the infusion of albumin, and critically reviews the clinical evidence for treatment of AD using TPE and albumin replacement. This review also highlights potential sources of bias that must be considered in conjunction with the evidence of efficacy for the use of TPE in AD.",2023,Albumin Replacement; Peripheral Sink Hypothesis; Plasmapheresis; Therapeutic Apheresis; Therapeutic Plasma Exchange,Humans; Albumins; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Plasma Exchange; Plasmapheresis,"Rohrer, L; Yunce, M; Montine, TJ; Shan, H"
Potential of Capric Acid in Neurological Disorders: An Overview.,"To solve the restrictions of a classical ketogenic diet, a modified medium-chain triglyceride diet was introduced which required only around 60% of dietary energy. Capric acid (CA), a small molecule, is one of the main components because its metabolic profile offers itself as an alternate source of energy to the brain in the form of ketone bodies. This is possible with the combined capability of CA to cross the blood-brain barrier and achieve a concentration of 50% concentration in the brain more than any other fatty acid in plasma. Natural sources of CA include vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil, mammalian milk and some seeds. Several studies have shown that CA has varied action on targets that include AMPA receptors, PPAR-γ, inflammatory/oxidative stress pathways and gut dysbiosis. Based on these lines of evidence, CA has proved to be effective in the amelioration of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, affective disorders and Alzheimer's disease. But these studies still warrant more pre-clinical and clinical studies that would further prove its efficacy. Hence, to understand the potential of CA in brain disease and associated comorbid conditions, an advance and rigorous molecular mechanistic study, apart from the reported in-vitro/in-vivo studies, is urgently required for the development of this compound through clinical setups.",2023,Capric acid; Ketogenic diet; Metabolism; Neurological disorders; Neurotransmitter,"Animals; Humans; Decanoic Acids; Fatty Acids; Diet, Ketogenic; Epilepsy; Mammals","Shekhar, N; Tyagi, S; Rani, S; Thakur, AK"

"Anosmia, mild cognitive impairment, and biomarkers of brain aging in older adults.","Olfactory impairment is a potential marker for prodromal dementia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This population-based study included 4214 dementia-free participants (age ≥65 years). Olfaction was assessed using the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks identification test. In the subsamples, we measured plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)40, Aβ42, total tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL; n = 1054); and quantified hippocampal, entorhinal cortex, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-signature cortical thickness (n = 917). Data were analyzed with logistic and linear regression models. In the total sample, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed in 1102 persons (26.2%; amnestic MCI, n = 931; non-amnestic MCI, n = 171). Olfactory impairment was significantly associated with increased likelihoods of MCI, amnestic MCI, and non-amnestic MCI. In the subsamples, anosmia was significantly associated with higher plasma total tau and NfL concentrations, smaller hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes, and greater WMH volume, and marginally with lower AD-signature cortical thickness. These results suggest that cerebral neurodegenerative and microvascular lesions are common neuropathologies linking anosmia with MCI in older adults.",2023,brain aging; mild cognitive impairment; neurodegeneration; olfaction; population-based study; white matter hyperintensity,Humans; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Anosmia; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Aging; tau Proteins,"Dong, Y; Li, Y; Liu, K; Han, X; Liu, R; Ren, Y; Cong, L; Zhang, Q; Hou, T; Song, L; Tang, S; Shi, L; Luo, Y; Kalpouzos, G; Laukka, EJ; Winblad, B; Wang, Y; Du, Y; Qiu, C"

Plasma Phosphorylated Tau at Threonine 181 and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer Disease.,"Plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), a well-validated marker of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologic change, could be a more efficient way to diagnose AD than invasive or expensive biomarkers requiring CSF or PET. In some individuals, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are the earliest manifestation of AD, observed in advance of clear cognitive decline. However, the few studies assessing AD biomarkers in association with NPS have often had imprecision in capturing behavioral symptoms that represent sequelae of neurodegenerative disease. Thus, the mild behavioral impairment (MBI) construct was developed, framing NPS in a way to improve the precision of risk estimates for disease. MBI core criteria stipulate that NPS emerge de novo in later life and persist for at least 6 months. Here, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, we investigated associations of MBI with p-tau181, neuropsychological test performance, and incident AD.",2023,,Humans; Female; Aged; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Neuropsychological Tests; Disease Progression; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Ghahremani, M; Wang, M; Chen, HY; Zetterberg, H; Smith, E; Ismail, Z"

Targeting amyloid proteins for clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.,"Abnormal aggregation and accumulation of pathological amyloid proteins such as amyloid-β, Tau, and α-synuclein play key pathological roles and serve as histological hallmarks in different neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, various post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been identified on pathological amyloid proteins and are subjected to change during disease progression. Given the central role of amyloid proteins in NDs, tremendous efforts have been made to develop amyloid-targeting strategies for clinical diagnosis and molecular classification of NDs. In this review, we summarize two major strategies for targeting amyloid aggregates, with a focus on the trials in AD diagnosis. The first strategy is a positron emission tomography (PET) scan of protein aggregation in the brain. We mainly focus on introducing the development of small-molecule PET tracers for specifically recognizing pathological amyloid fibrils. The second strategy is the detection of PTM biomarkers on amyloid proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. We discuss the pathological roles of different PTMs in diseases and how we can use the PTM profile of amyloid proteins for clinical diagnosis. Finally, we point out the potential technical challenges of these two strategies, and outline other potential strategies, as well as a combination of multiple strategies, for molecular diagnosis of NDs.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid aggregation; Biomarker; Clinical diagnosis; Neurodegenerative diseases; Positron emission tomography (PET) tracer; Post-translational modification; Tau,,"Zhang, S; Dong, H; Bian, J; Li, D; Liu, C"
The clinical and molecular spectrum of ZFYVE26-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia: SPG15.,"In the field of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), progress in molecular diagnostics needs to be translated into robust phenotyping studies to understand genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and to support interventional trials. ZFYVE26-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP-ZFYVE26, SPG15) is a rare, early-onset complex HSP, characterized by progressive spasticity and a variety of other neurological symptoms. While prior reports, often in populations with high rates of consanguinity, have established a general phenotype, there is a lack of systematic investigations and a limited understanding of age-dependent manifestation of symptoms. Here we delineate the clinical, neuroimaging and molecular features of 44 individuals from 36 families, the largest cohort assembled to date. Median age at last follow-up was 23.8 years covering a wide age range (11-61 years). While symptom onset often occurred in early childhood [median: 24 months, interquartile range (IQR) = 24], a molecular diagnosis was reached at a median age of 18.8 years (IQR = 8), indicating significant diagnostic delay. We demonstrate that most patients present with motor and/or speech delay or learning disabilities. Importantly, these developmental symptoms preceded the onset of motor symptoms by several years. Progressive spasticity in the lower extremities, the hallmark feature of HSP-ZFYVE26, typically presents in adolescence and involves the distal lower limbs before progressing proximally. Spasticity in the upper extremities was seen in 64%. We found a high prevalence of extrapyramidal movement disorders including cerebellar ataxia (64%) and dystonia (11%). Parkinsonism (16%) was present in a subset and showed no sustained response to levodopa. Cognitive decline and neurogenic bladder dysfunction progressed over time in most patients. A systematic analysis of brain MRI features revealed a common diagnostic signature consisting of thinning of the anterior corpus callosum, signal changes of the anterior forceps and non-specific cortical and cerebellar atrophy. The molecular spectrum included 45 distinct variants, distributed across the protein structure without mutational hotspots. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale scores, SPATAX Disability Scores and the Four Stage Functional Mobility Score showed moderate strength in representing the proportion of variation between disease duration and motor dysfunction. Plasma neurofilament light chain levels were significantly elevated in all patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.0001) and were correlated inversely with age (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = -0.65, P = 0.01). In summary, our systematic cross-sectional analysis of HSP-ZFYVE26 patients across a wide age-range, delineates core clinical, neuroimaging and molecular features and identifies markers of disease severity. These results raise awareness to this rare disease, facilitate an early diagnosis and create clinical trial readiness.",2023,ataxia; hereditary spastic paraplegia; movement disorders; speech delay; thin corpus callosum,"Humans; Child, Preschool; Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delayed Diagnosis; Proteins; Mutation","Saffari, A; Kellner, M; Jordan, C; Rosengarten, H; Mo, A; Zhang, B; Strelko, O; Neuser, S; Davis, MY; Yoshikura, N; Futamura, N; Takeuchi, T; Nabatame, S; Ishiura, H; Tsuji, S; Aldeen, HS; Cali, E; Rocca, C; Houlden, H; Efthymiou, S; Assmann, B; Yoon, G; Trombetta, BA; Kivisäkk, P; Eichler, F; Nan, H; Takiyama, Y; Tessa, A; Santorelli, FM; Sahin, M; Blackstone, C; Yang, E; Schüle, R; Ebrahimi-Fakhari, D"

Blood plasma protein profiles of neuropsychiatric symptoms and related cognitive decline in older people.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) severely affect patients and their caregivers, and are associated with worse long-term outcomes. This study tested the hypothesis that altered protein levels in blood plasma could serve as biomarkers of NPS; and that altered protein levels are associated with persisting NPS and cognitive decline over time. We performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal study in older subjects with cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired in a memory clinic setting. NPS were recorded through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) while cognitive and functional impairment was assessed using the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SoB) score at baseline and follow-up visits. Shotgun proteomic analysis based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted in blood plasma samples, identifying 420 proteins. The presence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology was determined by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Eighty-five subjects with a mean age of 70 (±7.4) years, 62% female and 54% with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia were included. We found 15 plasma proteins with altered baseline levels in participants with NPS (NPI-Q score > 0). Adding those 15 proteins to a reference model based on clinical data (age, CDR-SoB) significantly improved the prediction of NPS (from receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC] 0.75 to AUC 0.91, p = 0.004) with a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 74%. The identified proteins additionally predicted both persisting NPS and cognitive decline at follow-up visits. The observed associations were independent of the presence of AD pathology.

Quantitative systems pharmacology model of the amyloid pathway in Alzheimer's disease: Insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of clinical candidates.,"Despite considerable investment into potential therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD), currently approved treatment options are limited. Predictive modeling using quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) can be used to guide the design of clinical trials in AD. This study developed a QSP model representing amyloid beta (Aβ) pathophysiology in AD. The model included mechanisms of Aβ monomer production and aggregation to form insoluble fibrils and plaques; the transport of soluble species between the compartments of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma; and the pharmacokinetics, transport, and binding of monoclonal antibodies to targets in the three compartments. Ordinary differential equations were used to describe these processes quantitatively. The model components were calibrated to data from the literature and internal studies, including quantitative data supporting the underlying AD biology and clinical data from clinical trials for anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) aducanumab, crenezumab, gantenerumab, and solanezumab. The model was developed for an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele carrier and tested for an APOE ɛ4 noncarrier. Results indicate that the model is consistent with data on clinical Aβ accumulation in untreated individuals and those treated with monoclonal antibodies, capturing increases in Aβ load accurately. This model may be used to investigate additional AD mechanisms and their impact on biomarkers, as well as predict Aβ load at different dose levels for mAbs with known targets and binding affinities. This model may facilitate the design of scientifically enriched and efficient clinical trials by enabling a priori prediction of biomarker dynamics in the brain and CSF.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Network Pharmacology; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Apolipoproteins E","Ramakrishnan, V; Friedrich, C; Witt, C; Sheehan, R; Pryor, M; Atwal, JK; Wildsmith, K; Kudrycki, K; Lee, SH; Mazer, N; Hofmann, C; Fuji, RN; Jin, JY; Ramanujan, S; Dolton, M; Quartino, A"
Association of Obesity With Cognitive Decline in Black and White Americans.,"There are disparities in the prevalence of obesity by race, and the relationship between obesity and cognitive decline is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether obesity is independently associated with cognitive decline and whether the association between obesity and cognitive decline differs in Black and White adults.

Neuronal Ganglioside and Glycosphingolipid (GSL) Metabolism and Disease : Cascades of Secondary Metabolic Errors Can Generate Complex Pathologies (in LSDs).,"Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are a diverse group of membrane components occurring mainly on the surfaces of mammalian cells. They and their metabolites have a role in intercellular communication, serving as versatile biochemical signals (Kaltner et al, Biochem J 476(18):2623-2655, 2019) and in many cellular pathways. Anionic GSLs, the sialic acid containing gangliosides (GGs), are essential constituents of neuronal cell surfaces, whereas anionic sulfatides are key components of myelin and myelin forming oligodendrocytes. The stepwise biosynthetic pathways of GSLs occur at and lead along the membranes of organellar surfaces of the secretory pathway. After formation of the hydrophobic ceramide membrane anchor of GSLs at the ER, membrane-spanning glycosyltransferases (GTs) of the Golgi and Trans-Golgi network generate cell type-specific GSL patterns for cellular surfaces. GSLs of the cellular plasma membrane can reach intra-lysosomal, i.e. luminal, vesicles (ILVs) by endocytic pathways for degradation. Soluble glycoproteins, the glycosidases, lipid binding and transfer proteins and acid ceramidase are needed for the lysosomal catabolism of GSLs at ILV-membrane surfaces. Inherited mutations triggering a functional loss of glycosylated lysosomal hydrolases and lipid binding proteins involved in GSL degradation cause a primary lysosomal accumulation of their non-degradable GSL substrates in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Lipid binding proteins, the SAPs, and the various lipids of the ILV-membranes regulate GSL catabolism, but also primary storage compounds such as sphingomyelin (SM), cholesterol (Chol.), or chondroitin sulfate can effectively inhibit catabolic lysosomal pathways of GSLs. This causes cascades of metabolic errors, accumulating secondary lysosomal GSL- and GG- storage that can trigger a complex pathology (Breiden and Sandhoff, Int J Mol Sci 21(7):2566, 2020).",2023,Alzheimer; Catabolism; Degradation; Development; Endosomal pathway; Frontal lobe dementia; Ganglio-series; Ganglioside; Genetic disease; Glycolipid; Glycosphingolipid; Glycosyltransferase; Hydrolase; Intra-lysosomal luminal vesicle (ILV); Lysosomal storage disease (LSD); Lysosome; Membrane-surface; Metabolism; Neurodegenerative disease; Neuron; Organelle; Parkinson; Receptor; Secondary storage; Secretory pathway; Sphingolipid-binding protein (SAP); Sphingolipid-transfer protein; Topology,Animals; Glycosphingolipids; Gangliosides; Acid Ceramidase; Sphingomyelins; Sulfoglycosphingolipids; N-Acetylneuraminic Acid; Chondroitin Sulfates; Lysosomal Storage Diseases; Ceramides; Cholesterol; Glycosyltransferases; Glycoproteins; Glycoside Hydrolases; Mammals,"Sandhoff, R; Sandhoff, K"

Investigating the plasma-liver-brain axis of omega-3 fatty acid metabolism in mouse knock-in for the human apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele.,"The metabolism of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is different in carriers of APOE4, the main genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The brain relies on the plasma DHA pool for its need, but the plasma-liver-brain axis in relation to cognition remains obscure. We hypothesized that this relationship is compromised in APOE4 mice considering the differences in fatty acid metabolism between APOE3 and APOE4 mice. Male and female APOE3 and APOE4 mice were fed either a diet enriched with DHA (0.7 g DHA/100 g diet) or a control diet for 8 months. There was a significant genotype × diet interaction for DHA concentration in the liver and adipose tissue. In the cortex, a genotype effect was found where APOE4 mice had a higher concentration of DHA than APOE3 mice fed the control diet. There was a significant genotype × diet interaction for the liver and hippocampal arachidonic acid (AA). APOE4 mice had 20-30% lower plasma DHA and AA concentrations than APOE3 mice, independent of diet. Plasma and liver DHA levels were significantly correlated in APOE3 and APOE4 mice. In APOE4 mice, there was a significant correlation between plasma, adipose tissues, cortex DHA and the Barnes maze and/or with a better recognition index. Moreover, higher AA levels in the liver and the hippocampus of APOE4 mice were correlated with lower cognitive performance. Our results suggest that there is a plasma-liver-brain axis of DHA that is modified in APOE4 mice. Moreover, our data support that APOE4 mice rely more on plasma DHA than APOE3 mice, especially in cognitive performance. Any disturbance in plasma DHA metabolism might have a greater impact on cognition in APOE4 carriers.",2023,APOE; Alzheimer's disease; Barnes maze; Docosahexaenoic acid; Omega-3 fatty acid,"Humans; Animals; Mice; Male; Female; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoprotein E3; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Alleles; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Arachidonic Acid; Brain; Liver; Apolipoproteins E; Mice, Transgenic","Husain, MA; Vachon, A; Chouinard-Watkins, R; Vandal, M; Calon, F; Plourde, M"

Determination of Catecholamines in a Small Volume (25 μL) of Plasma from Conscious Mouse Tail Vein.,"The determination of plasma catecholamine levels is commonly used as a measure of the sympathetic nervous system's response to stress and is highly important for diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases, catecholamine-secreting tumors arising from the chromaffin cells of the sympathoadrenal system, and affective disorders. Diseases in which catecholamines are significantly elevated include pheochromocytoma, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, von Hippel-Lindau disease, baroreflex failure, chemodectina (nonchromaffin paraganglioma), and multiple endocrine neoplasia. Plasma norepinephrine levels provide a guide to prognosis in patients with stable, chronic, and congestive heart diseases. The method described here for the determination of plasma catecholamines is based on the principle that plasma catecholamines are selectively adsorbed on acid-washed alumina at pH 8.7 and then eluted at a pH between 1.0 and 2.0. Upon injection, catecholamines in elutes were separated by a reversed phase C-18 column. After separation, the catecholamines present within the mobile phase enter the electrochemical detector. Electrochemical detection occurs because electroactive compounds oxidize at a certain potential and thereby liberate electrons that create measurable current. Catecholamines readily form quinones under these conditions, get oxidized, release two electrons, and create current. The electrochemical detector detects this electrical current that linearly correlates to the catecholamine concentration loaded into the ultra-performance liquid chromatography instrument. A 15-min mixing time during the adsorption and desorption steps was found to be optimal. If the washing step was omitted, the catecholamines could not be eluted from the acid-washed alumina. To prevent dilution, the alumina had to be centrifuged and not aspirated to dryness after the washing step. We report here that by changing the range in the electrochemical detector, plasma catecholamines were measured with only 12.5 μL of plasma and more reliably with 25 μL of plasma. The detection limit was 1 ng/mL. This assay method is very useful as blood can be collected from the tail vein in a conscious mouse and the same mouse can be used for time-dependent or age-dependent studies.",2023,Catecholamine; Chromatography; Dopamine; Electrochemical detection; Epinephrine; Norepinephrine; Plasma,"Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Aluminum Oxide; Animals; Catecholamines; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Mice; Norepinephrine; Quinones; Tail","Tang, K; Mahata, SK"

Measures of cortical microstructure are linked to amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Markers of downstream events are a key component of clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease. Morphological metrics like cortical thickness are established measures of atrophy but are not sensitive enough to detect amyloid-beta (Aβ)- related changes that occur before overt atrophy become visible. We aimed to investigate to what extent diffusion MRI can provide sensitive markers of cortical microstructural changes and to test their associations with multiple aspects of the Alzheimer's disease pathological cascade, including both Aβ and tau accumulation, astrocytic activation and cognitive deficits. We applied the mean apparent diffusion propagator model to diffusion MRI data from 492 cognitively unimpaired elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort. Participants were stratified in Aβ-negative/tau-negative, Aβ-positive/tau-negative and Aβ-positive/tau-positive based on Aβ- and tau-PET uptake. Cortical regional values of diffusion MRI metrics and cortical thickness were compared across groups. Associations between regional values of diffusion MRI metrics and both Aβ- and tau-PET uptake were also investigated along with the association with plasma level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocyte activation (available in 292 participants). Mean squared displacement revealed widespread microstructural differences already between Aβ-negative/tau-negative and Aβ-positive/tau-negative participants with a spatial distribution that closely resembled the pattern of Aβ accumulation. In contrast, differences in cortical thickness were clearly more limited. Mean squared displacement was also correlated with both Aβ- and tau-PET uptake even independently from one another and from cortical thickness. Further, the same metric exhibited significantly stronger correlations with PET uptake than cortical thickness (P < 0.05). Mean squared displacement was also positively correlated with GFAP with a pattern that resembles Aβ accumulation, and GFAP partially mediated the association between Aβ accumulation and mean squared displacement. Further, impairments in executive functions were significantly more associated with mean squared displacement values extracted from a meta-region of interest encompassing regions accumulating Aβ early in the disease process, than with cortical thickness (P < 0.05). Similarly, impairments in memory functions were significantly more associated with mean squared displacement values extracted from a temporal meta-region of interest than with cortical thickness (P < 0.05). Metrics of cortical microstructural alteration derived from diffusion MRI are highly sensitive to multiple aspects of the Alzheimer's disease pathological cascade. Of particular interest is the link with both Aβ-PET and GFAP, suggesting diffusion MRI might reflects microstructural changes related to the astrocytic response to Aβ aggregation. Therefore, metrics of cortical diffusion might be important outcome measures in anti-Aβ treatments clinical trials for detecting drug-induced changes in cortical microstructure.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; astrocytes; cortical diffusion,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Brain; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Amyloid; Atrophy; Biomarkers,"Spotorno, N; Strandberg, O; Vis, G; Stomrud, E; Nilsson, M; Hansson, O"

Perspective on Cav-1 for its Potential as Newer Therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting around 10 million people worldwide. Dopamine agonists that mimic the action of natural dopamine in the brain are the prominent drugs used in the management of PD symptoms. However, the therapy is limited to symptomatic relief with serious side effects. Phytocompounds have become the preferable targets of research in the quest for new pharmaceutical compounds. In addition, current research is directed towards determining a newer specific target for the better treatment and management of PD. Cav-1, a membrane protein present on the caveolae of the plasma membrane, acts as a transporter for lipid molecules in the cells. Cav-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease (AD), PD, etc. In this review, we have extensively discussed the role of Cav-1 protein in the pathogenesis of PD.

Head-to-head comparison of 10 plasma phospho-tau assays in prodromal Alzheimer's disease.,"Plasma phospho-tau (p-tau) species have emerged as the most promising blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we performed a head-to-head comparison of p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 measured using 10 assays to detect abnormal brain amyloid-β (Aβ) status and predict future progression to Alzheimer's dementia. The study included 135 patients with baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (mean age 72.4 years; 60.7% women) who were followed for an average of 4.9 years. Seventy-one participants had abnormal Aβ-status (i.e. abnormal CSF Aβ42/40) at baseline; and 45 of these Aβ-positive participants progressed to Alzheimer's dementia during follow-up. P-tau concentrations were determined in baseline plasma and CSF. P-tau217 and p-tau181 were both measured using immunoassays developed by Lilly Research Laboratories (Lilly) and mass spectrometry assays developed at Washington University (WashU). P-tau217 was also analysed using Simoa immunoassay developed by Janssen Research and Development (Janss). P-tau181 was measured using Simoa immunoassay from ADxNeurosciences (ADx), Lumipulse immunoassay from Fujirebio (Fuji) and Splex immunoassay from Mesoscale Discovery (Splex). Both p-tau181 and p-tau231 were quantified using Simoa immunoassay developed at the University of Gothenburg (UGOT). We found that the mass spectrometry-based p-tau217 (p-tau217WashU) exhibited significantly better performance than all other plasma p-tau biomarkers when detecting abnormal Aβ status [area under curve (AUC) = 0.947; Pdiff < 0.015] or progression to Alzheimer's dementia (AUC = 0.932; Pdiff < 0.027). Among immunoassays, p-tau217Lilly had the highest AUCs (0.886-0.889), which was not significantly different from the AUCs of p-tau217Janss, p-tau181ADx and p-tau181WashU (AUCrange 0.835-0.872; Pdiff > 0.09), but higher compared with AUC of p-tau231UGOT, p-tau181Lilly, p-tau181UGOT, p-tau181Fuji and p-tau181Splex (AUCrange 0.642-0.813; Pdiff ≤ 0.029). Correlations between plasma and CSF values were strongest for p-tau217WashU (R = 0.891) followed by p-tau217Lilly (R = 0.755; Pdiff = 0.003 versus p-tau217WashU) and weak to moderate for the rest of the p-tau biomarkers (Rrange 0.320-0.669). In conclusion, our findings suggest that among all tested plasma p-tau assays, mass spectrometry-based measures of p-tau217 perform best when identifying mild cognitive impairment patients with abnormal brain Aβ or those who will subsequently progress to Alzheimer's dementia.

Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Are Associated with Physical Functioning Outcomes Among Cognitively Normal Adults in the Multiethnic HABS-HD Cohort.,"In this study, we examined the link between plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and physical functioning outcomes within a community-dwelling, multiethnic cohort. Data from 1 328 cognitively unimpaired participants (n = 659 Mexican American and n = 669 non-Hispanic White) from the ongoing Health & Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD) cohort were examined. Plasma AD biomarkers (amyloid beta [Aβ]40, Aβ42, total tau [t-tau], and neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were assayed using the ultra-sensitive Simoa platform. Physical functioning measures were the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Cross-sectional linear regression analyses revealed that plasma Aβ 40 (p < .001), Aβ 42 (p = .003), and NfL (p < .001) were each significantly associated with TUG time in seconds. Plasma Aβ 40 (p < .001), Aβ 42 (p < .001), t-tau (p = .002), and NfL (p < .001) were each significantly associated with SPPB Total Score. Additional analyses demonstrate that the link between plasma AD biomarkers and physical functioning outcomes were strongest among Mexican Americans. Plasma AD biomarkers are receiving a great deal of attention in the literature and are now available clinically including use in clinical trials. The examination of AD biomarkers and physical functioning may allow for the development of risk profiles, which could stratify a person's risk for neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, based on plasma AD biomarkers, physical functioning, ethnicity, or a combination of these measures prior to the onset of cognitive impairment.",2023,Biomarkers; Brain aging; Health disparities; Mexican American; Physical functioning,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cross-Sectional Studies; tau Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"O'Bryant, SE; Petersen, M; Hall, JR; Large, S; Johnson, LA"

MT1-MMP and ADAM10/17 exhibit a remarkable overlap of shedding properties.,"Membrane-type-I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is one of six human membrane-bound MMPs and is responsible for extracellular matrix remodelling by degrading several substrates like fibrillar collagens, including types I-III, or fibronectin. Moreover, MT1-MMP was described as a key player in cancer progression and it is involved in various inflammatory processes, as well as in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The membrane-tethered metalloprotease meprin β as well as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) and ADAM17 are also associated with these diseases. Interestingly, meprin β, ADAM10/17 and MT1-MMP also have a shared substrate pool including the interleukin-6 receptor and the amyloid precursor protein. We investigated the interaction of these proteases, focusing on a possible connection between MT1-MMP and meprin β, to elucidate the potential mutual regulations of both enzymes. Herein, we show that besides ADAM10/17, MT1-MMP is also able to shed meprin β from the plasma membrane, leading to the release of soluble meprin β.

A review on comparative studies addressing exosome isolation methods from body fluids.,"Exosomes emerged as valuable sources of disease biomarkers and new therapeutic tools. However, extracellular vesicles isolation with exosome-like characteristics from certain biofluids is still challenging which can limit their potential use in clinical settings. While ultracentrifugation-based procedures are the gold standard for exosome isolation from cell cultures, no unique and standardized method for exosome isolation from distinct body fluids exists. The complexity, specific composition, and physical properties of each biofluid constitute a technical barrier to obtain reproducible and pure exosome preparations, demanding a detailed characterization of both exosome isolation and characterization methods. Moreover, some isolation procedures can affect downstream proteomic or RNA profiling analysis. This review compiles and discussed a set of comparative studies addressing distinct exosome isolation methods from human biofluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, serum, saliva, and urine, also focusing on body fluid specific challenges, physical properties, and other potential variation sources. This summarized information will facilitate the choice of exosome isolation methods, based on the type of biological samples available, and hopefully encourage the use of exosomes in translational and clinical research.",2023,Biofluids; Extracellular vesicles; Isolation methods,Humans; Exosomes; Proteomics; Ultracentrifugation; Body Fluids; Cell Culture Techniques,"Martins, TS; Vaz, M; Henriques, AG"
Extracellular vesicle biomarkers for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.,"Besides motor symptoms, many individuals with Parkinson's disease develop cognitive impairment perhaps due to coexisting α-synuclein and Alzheimer's disease pathologies and impaired brain insulin signalling. Discovering biomarkers for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease could help clarify the underlying pathogenic processes and improve Parkinson's disease diagnosis and prognosis. This study used plasma samples from 273 participants: 103 Parkinson's disease individuals with normal cognition, 121 Parkinson's disease individuals with cognitive impairment (81 with mild cognitive impairment, 40 with dementia) and 49 age- and sex-matched controls. Plasma extracellular vesicles enriched for neuronal origin were immunocaptured by targeting the L1 cell adhesion molecule, then biomarkers were quantified using immunoassays. α-Synuclein was lower in Parkinson's disease compared to control individuals (P = 0.004) and in cognitively impaired Parkinson's disease individuals compared to Parkinson's disease with normal cognition (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.001) individuals. Amyloid-β42 did not differ between groups. Phosphorylated tau (T181) was higher in Parkinson's disease than control individuals (P = 0.003) and in cognitively impaired compared to cognitively normal Parkinson's disease individuals (P < 0.001) and controls (P < 0.001). Total tau was not different between groups. Tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 was lower in Parkinson's disease compared to control individuals (P = 0.03) and in cognitively impaired compared to cognitively normal Parkinson's disease individuals (P = 0.02) and controls (P = 0.01), and also decreased with increasing motor symptom severity (P = 0.005); serine312-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 was not different between groups. Mechanistic target of rapamycin was not different between groups, whereas phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin trended lower in cognitively impaired compared to cognitively normal Parkinson's disease individuals (P = 0.05). The ratio of α-synuclein to phosphorylated tau181 was lower in Parkinson's disease compared to controls (P = 0.001), in cognitively impaired compared to cognitively normal Parkinson's disease individuals (P < 0.001) and decreased with increasing motor symptom severity (P < 0.001). The ratio of insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylated serine312 to insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylated tyrosine was higher in Parkinson's disease compared to control individuals (P = 0.01), in cognitively impaired compared to cognitively normal Parkinson's disease individuals (P = 0.02) and increased with increasing motor symptom severity (P = 0.003). α-Synuclein, phosphorylated tau181 and insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylated tyrosine contributed in diagnostic classification between groups. These findings suggest that both α-synuclein and tau pathologies and impaired insulin signalling underlie Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment.

Extracellular Amyloid β-protein (1-42) Oligomers Anchor Brain Cells and Make them inert as an Unconventional Integrin-Coupled Ligand.,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of extracellular Aβ42 on neural cell migration, and the possible molecular mechanisms. Extracellular Aβ42 monomers did not negatively affect the motility of neural cells; however, they could promote cell migration from toxic extracellular Aβ42 oligomers. Contrastingly, extracellular Aβ42 aggregates, especially Aβ42 oligomers, significantly decreased neural cell migration while reducing their survival. Further, their soluble and deposited states showed different effects in causing the neural cells to become inert (incapable of moving). These findings were consistent with that of binding of Aβ42 oligomers to the plasma membrane or integrin receptors of the inert cells. By combining the protection of cell migratory capability by anti-oligomeric Aβ42 scFv antibody with the information obtained from our docking model of the Aβ42 trimer and integrin molecule, our findings suggest that extracellular Aβ42 aggregates disrupt the function of integrins mainly through the RHDS motif of Aβ42 chain, which eventually causes neural cells to become inert. Thus, we propose an ""anchor"" opinion, where Aβ42 aggregates in the ECM serve as the adverse ""anchors"" in the brain for anchoring neurons and for making neural cells inert, which causes their dysfunction. The neural cells with damaged motility could be restored or repaired if these anchoring effects of extracellular Aβ42 aggregates on the neural cells were severed or reduced, even if the ""anchors"" themselves were not completely eliminated. Medicines targeting soluble and deposited anchors of Aβ42 aggregates could be developed into effective treatments for Alzheimer disease.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Amyloid β-protein; Anchor; Integrin; Matrix; Migration,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Ligands; Peptide Fragments; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Amyloid,"Zhang, T; Song, C; Zheng, C; Chen, X; Zhang, Y"
The small HDL particle hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"We propose the hypothesis that small high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by virtue of their capacity to exchange lipids, affecting neuronal membrane composition and vascular and synaptic functions. Concentrations of small HDLs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were measured in 180 individuals ≥60 years of age using ion mobility methodology. Small HDL concentrations in CSF were positively associated with performance in three domains of cognitive function independent of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status, age, sex, and years of education. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between levels of small HDLs in CSF and plasma. Further studies will be aimed at determining whether specific components of small HDL exchange across the blood, brain, and CSF barriers, and developing approaches to exploit small HDLs for therapeutic purposes.",2023,APOE; HDL; cerebrospinal fluid; cognition; lipidomics; proteomics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins E; Apolipoprotein E4; Brain; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Martinez, AE; Weissberger, G; Kuklenyik, Z; He, X; Meuret, C; Parekh, T; Rees, JC; Parks, BA; Gardner, MS; King, SM; Collier, TS; Harrington, MG; Sweeney, MD; Wang, X; Zlokovic, BV; Joe, E; Nation, DA; Schneider, LS; Chui, HC; Barr, JR; Han, SD; Krauss, RM; Yassine, HN"
Plasma biomarkers and genetics in the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease.,"Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease-related pathologies have undergone rapid developments during the past few years, and there are now well-validated blood tests for amyloid and tau pathology, as well as neurodegeneration and astrocytic activation. To define Alzheimer's disease with biomarkers rather than clinical assessment, we assessed prediction of research-diagnosed disease status using these biomarkers and tested genetic variants associated with the biomarkers that may reflect more accurately the risk of biochemically defined Alzheimer's disease instead of the risk of dementia. In a cohort of Alzheimer's disease cases [n = 1439, mean age 68 years (standard deviation = 8.2)] and screened controls [n = 508, mean age 82 years (standard deviation = 6.8)], we measured plasma concentrations of the 40 and 42 amino acid-long amyloid-β (Aβ) fragments (Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively), tau phosphorylated at amino acid 181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using state-of-the-art Single molecule array (Simoa) technology. We tested the relationships between the biomarkers and Alzheimer's disease genetic risk, age at onset and disease duration. We also conducted a genome-wide association study for association of disease risk genes with these biomarkers. The prediction accuracy of Alzheimer's disease clinical diagnosis by the combination of all biomarkers, APOE and polygenic risk score reached area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81, with the most significant contributors being ε4, Aβ40 or Aβ42, GFAP and NfL. All biomarkers were significantly associated with age in cases and controls (P < 4.3 × 10-5). Concentrations of the Aβ-related biomarkers in plasma were significantly lower in cases compared with controls, whereas other biomarker levels were significantly higher in cases. In the case-control genome-wide analyses, APOE-ε4 was associated with all biomarkers (P = 0.011-4.78 × 10-8), except NfL. No novel genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the case-control design; however, in a case-only analysis, we found two independent genome-wide significant associations between the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and WWOX and COPG2 genes. Disease prediction modelling by the combination of all biomarkers indicates that the variance attributed to P-tau181 is mostly captured by APOE-ε4, whereas Aβ40, Aβ42, GFAP and NfL biomarkers explain additional variation over and above APOE. We identified novel plausible genome wide-significant genes associated with Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in a sample which is 50 times smaller than current genome-wide association studies in Alzheimer's disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Plasma biomarkers; genome-wide association study,"Humans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Amino Acids; Apolipoproteins E; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments","Stevenson-Hoare, J; Heslegrave, A; Leonenko, G; Fathalla, D; Bellou, E; Luckcuck, L; Marshall, R; Sims, R; Morgan, BP; Hardy, J; de Strooper, B; Williams, J; Zetterberg, H; Escott-Price, V"
