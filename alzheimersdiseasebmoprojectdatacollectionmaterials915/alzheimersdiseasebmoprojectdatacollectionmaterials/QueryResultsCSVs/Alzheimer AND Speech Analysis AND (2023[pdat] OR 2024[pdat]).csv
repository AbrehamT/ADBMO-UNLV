Macro and micro structural preservation of grey matter integrity after 24 weeks of rTMS in Alzheimer's disease patients: a pilot study.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by structural and functional dysfunction involving the Default Mode Network (DMN), for which the Precuneus (PC) is a key node. We proposed a randomized double-blind pilot study to determine neurobiological changes after 24 weeks of PC-rTMS in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Sixteen patients were randomly assigned to SHAM or PC-rTMS, and received an intensive 2-weeks course with daily rTMS sessions, followed by a maintenance phase in which rTMS has been applied once a week. Before and after the treatment structural and functional MRIs were collected. Our results showed macro- and micro-structural preservation in PC-rTMS compared to SHAM-rTMS group after 24 weeks of treatment, correlated to an increase of functional connectivity (FC) within the PC in the PC-rTMS group. Even if preliminary, these results trigger the possibility of using PC-rTMS to arrest atrophy progression by manipulating distributed network connectivity patterns.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Brain plasticity; Cortex; Default mode network; Microstructural; Precuneus; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Pilot Projects; Male; Female; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Gray Matter; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Parietal Lobe,"Mencarelli, L; Torso, M; Borghi, I; Assogna, M; Pezzopane, V; Bonnì, S; Di Lorenzo, F; Santarnecchi, E; Giove, F; Martorana, A; Bozzali, M; Ridgway, GR; Chance, SA; Koch, G"
Artificial intelligence classifies primary progressive aphasia from connected speech.,"Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best divided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this cross-sectional study, we first harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform unsupervised classification of short, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Large Language Models (LLMs) discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. In the subsequent supervised classification, seventeen distinctive features emerged, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of short, connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in classifying the four groups (three PPA variants and healthy controls). The data-driven section of this study showcases the ability of LLMs to find natural partitioning in the speech of patients with PPA consistent with conventional variants. In addition, the work identifies a robust set of language features indicative of each PPA variant, emphasizing the significance of dividing verbs into high and low-frequency categories. Beyond improving diagnostic accuracy, these findings enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of language processing.",2024,data-driven classification; generative artificial intelligence; primary progressive aphasia (PPA); theory-driven classification; verb frequency,,"Rezaii, N; Hochberg, D; Quimby, M; Wong, B; Brickhouse, M; Touroutoglou, A; Dickerson, BC; Wolff, P"

Machine Learning Approaches for Dementia Detection Through Speech and Gait Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review.,Dementia is a general term for several progressive neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Timely and accurate detection is crucial for early intervention.

Automated free speech analysis reveals distinct markers of Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.,"Dementia can disrupt how people experience and describe events as well as their own role in them. Alzheimer's disease (AD) compromises the processing of entities expressed by nouns, while behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) entails a depersonalized perspective with increased third-person references. Yet, no study has examined whether these patterns can be captured in connected speech via natural language processing tools. To tackle such gaps, we asked 96 participants (32 AD patients, 32 bvFTD patients, 32 healthy controls) to narrate a typical day of their lives and calculated the proportion of nouns, verbs, and first- or third-person markers (via part-of-speech and morphological tagging). We also extracted objective properties (frequency, phonological neighborhood, length, semantic variability) from each content word. In our main study (with 21 AD patients, 21 bvFTD patients, and 21 healthy controls), we used inferential statistics and machine learning for group-level and subject-level discrimination. The above linguistic features were correlated with patients' scores in tests of general cognitive status and executive functions. We found that, compared with HCs, (i) AD (but not bvFTD) patients produced significantly fewer nouns, (ii) bvFTD (but not AD) patients used significantly more third-person markers, and (iii) both patient groups produced more frequent words. Machine learning analyses showed that these features identified individuals with AD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.71). A generalizability test, with a model trained on the entire main study sample and tested on hold-out samples (11 AD patients, 11 bvFTD patients, 11 healthy controls), showed even better performance, with AUCs of 0.76 and 0.83 for AD and bvFTD, respectively. No linguistic feature was significantly correlated with cognitive test scores in either patient group. These results suggest that specific cognitive traits of each disorder can be captured automatically in connected speech, favoring interpretability for enhanced syndrome characterization, diagnosis, and monitoring.",2024,,Humans; Frontotemporal Dementia; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; Speech; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Biomarkers; Natural Language Processing; Machine Learning; Neuropsychological Tests; Executive Function,"Lopes da Cunha, P; Ruiz, F; Ferrante, F; Sterpin, LF; Ibáñez, A; Slachevsky, A; Matallana, D; Martínez, Á; Hesse, E; García, AM"

Using explainable artificial intelligence to identify linguistic biomarkers of amyloid pathology in primary progressive aphasia.,"Recent success has been achieved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials targeting amyloid beta (β), demonstrating a reduction in the rate of cognitive decline. However, testing methods for amyloid-β positivity are currently costly or invasive, motivating the development of accessible screening approaches to steer patients toward appropriate diagnostic tests. Here, we employ a pre-trained language model (Distil-RoBERTa) to identify amyloid-β positivity from a short, connected speech sample. We further use explainable AI (XAI) methods to extract interpretable linguistic features that can be employed in clinical practice.",2024,,,"Robertson, C; Rezaii, N; Hochberg, D; Quimby, M; Wolff, P; Dickerson, BC"
Amyloid-β and Phosphorylated Tau are the Key Biomarkers and Predictors of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a age-related neurodegenerative disease and is a major public health concern both in Texas, US and Worldwide. This neurodegenerative disease is mainly characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) accumulation in the brains of patients with AD and increasing evidence suggests that these are key biomarkers in AD. Both Aβ and p-tau can be detected through various imaging techniques (such as positron emission tomography, PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The presence of these biomarkers in individuals, who are asymptomatic or have mild cognitive impairment can indicate an increased risk of developing AD in the future. Furthermore, the combination of Aβ and p-tau biomarkers is often used for more accurate diagnosis and prediction of AD progression. Along with AD being a neurodegenerative disease, it is associated with other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and diabetes because studies have shown that these comorbid conditions make people more vulnerable to AD. In the first part of this review, we discuss that biofluid-based biomarkers such as Aβ, p-Tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Aβ & p-Tau in plasma could be used as an alternative sensitive technique to diagnose AD. In the second part, we discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms of chronic conditions linked with AD and how they affect the patients in clinical care.",2024,,,"Pradeepkiran, JA; Baig, J; Islam, MA; Kshirsagar, S; Reddy, PH"

Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD. Our new smartphone test, TapTalk, combines analysis of hand and speech-like movements to detect AD risk. This study aims to [1] determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately predict preclinical AD [2], determine usability, reliability, and validity of TapTalk in cognitively asymptomatic older adults and [3], prospectively validate TapTalk in older adults who have cognitive symptoms against cognitive tests and clinical diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Dementia; Diadochokinesis; Digital biomarker; Finger-tapping; Kinematics; Multimodal; TAS Test; TapTalk,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Alty, J; Goldberg, LR; Roccati, E; Lawler, K; Bai, Q; Huang, G; Bindoff, AD; Li, R; Wang, X; St George, RJ; Rudd, K; Bartlett, L; Collins, JM; Aiyede, M; Fernando, N; Bhagwat, A; Giffard, J; Salmon, K; McDonald, S; King, AE; Vickers, JC"

A Comprehensive Review on Synergy of Multi-Modal Data and AI Technologies in Medical Diagnosis.,"Disease diagnosis represents a critical and arduous endeavor within the medical field. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, spanning from machine learning and deep learning to large model paradigms, stand poised to significantly augment physicians in rendering more evidence-based decisions, thus presenting a pioneering solution for clinical practice. Traditionally, the amalgamation of diverse medical data modalities (e.g., image, text, speech, genetic data, physiological signals) is imperative to facilitate a comprehensive disease analysis, a topic of burgeoning interest among both researchers and clinicians in recent times. Hence, there exists a pressing need to synthesize the latest strides in multi-modal data and AI technologies in the realm of medical diagnosis. In this paper, we narrow our focus to five specific disorders (Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, depression, heart disease, epilepsy), elucidating advanced endeavors in their diagnosis and treatment through the lens of artificial intelligence. Our survey not only delineates detailed diagnostic methodologies across varying modalities but also underscores commonly utilized public datasets, the intricacies of feature engineering, prevalent classification models, and envisaged challenges for future endeavors.

Lower dynamic cerebral autoregulation following acute bout of low-volume high-intensity interval exercise in chronic stroke compared to healthy adults.,"Fluctuating arterial blood pressure during high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) may challenge dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), specifically after stroke after an injury to the cerebrovasculature.

The Optimization of a Natural Language Processing Approach for the Automatic Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using GPT Embeddings.,"As the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is projected to grow in the coming decades as the world's population ages, the development of noninvasive and cost-effective methods of detecting AD is essential for the early prevention and mitigation of the progressive disease, alleviating its expected global impact. This study analyzes audio processing techniques and transcription methodologies to optimize the detection of AD through the natural language processing (NLP) of spontaneous speech. We enhanced audio fidelity using Boll Spectral Subtraction and evaluated the transcription accuracy of state-of-the-art AI services-locally-based Wav2Vec and Whisper, alongside cloud-based IBM Cloud and Rev AI-against traditional manual transcription methods. The choice between local and cloud-based solutions hinges on a trade-off between privacy, ongoing costs, and computational requirements. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT for word embeddings, we enhanced the training of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, which were crucial in analyzing transcripts and refining detection accuracy. Our findings reveal that AI-driven transcriptions significantly outperform manual counterparts when classifying AD and Control samples, with Wav2Vec using enhanced audio exhibiting the highest accuracy and F-1 scores (0.99 for both metrics) for locally based systems and Rev AI using unenhanced audio leading cloud-based methods with comparable precision (0.96 for both metrics). The study also uncovers the detrimental effect of including interviewer speech in recordings on model performance, advocating for the exclusion of such interactions to improve data quality for AD classification algorithms. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that AI transcription (both Cloud and Local) and NLP technologies in their current forms can classify AD, as well as probable AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, accurately but suffer from a lack of available training data. The insights garnered from this research lay the groundwork for future advancements in the noninvasive monitoring and early detection of cognitive impairments through linguistic analysis.",2024,,,"Runde, BS; Alapati, A; Bazan, NG"
Connected speech features in non-English speakers with Alzheimer's disease: protocol for scoping review.,"A large body of literature indicates that connected speech profiles in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be utilized for diagnosis, disease monitoring, and for developing communication strategies for patients. Most connected speech research has been conducted in English, with little work in some European languages. Therefore, significant drawback remains with respect to the diversity of languages studied, and how the fragmentation of linguistic features differs across languages in AD. Accordingly, existing reviews on connected speech in AD have focused on findings from English-speaking patients; none have specifically focused on the linguistic diversity of AD populations. This scoping review is undertaken to provide the currently reported characteristics of connected speech in AD in languages other than English.

DDQ anti-aging properties expressed with improved mitophagy in mutant tau HT22 neuronal cells.,"The purpose of our study is to develop age-related phosphorylated tau (p-tau) inhibitors, for Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are wide-ranging therapeutic molecules available in the market and tested for age-related p-tau inhibition to enhance phosphatase activity and microtubule stability in AD neurons. Until now there are no such small molecules claimed to show promising results to delay the disease process of AD. However, a recently developed molecule, DDQ, has been shown to reduce abnormal protein-protein interactions and protect neurons from mutant protein-induced toxicities in the disease process. In addition, DDQ reduced age- and Aβ-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic toxicity. To date, there are no published reports on the p-tau interaction of DDQ and Sirt3 upregulation with CREB-mediated mitophagy activation in AD neurons. In the current study, HT22 cells were transfected with mutant Tau (mTau) cDNA and treated with the novel molecule DDQ. Cell survival, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analysis were conducted to assess cell viability and synaptic and mitophagy proteins in treated and untreated cell groups. As expected, we found cell survival was decreased in mTau-HT22 cells when compared with control HT22 cells. However, cell survival was increased in DDQ-treated mTau-HT22 cells when compared with mTau HT22 cells. P-tau and total tau proteins were significantly reduced in DDQ-treated mTau-HT22 cells, and MAP2 levels were increased. Anti-aging proteins like Sirt3, and CREB levels were increased in DDQ-treated HT22 cells and also in mTau-HT22 cells treated DDQ. Mitophagy proteins were decreased in mTau-HT22 cells and these were increased in DDQ-treated mTau-HT22 cells. These observations strongly suggest that DDQ has anti-p-tau and anti-aging properties, via Sirt3 overexpression and increased mitophagy proteins. Our study findings may have implications for healthy aging to the development of p-tau targeted therapeutics in AD and tauopathies.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Anti-aging; DDQ; Mitophagy; Sirt3,Humans; tau Proteins; Mitophagy; Sirtuin 3; Alzheimer Disease; Neurons; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Pradeepkiran, JA; Rawat, P; Reddy, AP; Orlov, E; Reddy, PH"
"A framework for language technologies in behavioral research and clinical applications: Ethical challenges, implications, and solutions.","Technological advances in the assessment and understanding of speech and language within the domains of automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning present a remarkable opportunity for psychologists to learn more about human thought and communication, evaluate a variety of clinical conditions, and predict cognitive and psychological states. These innovations can be leveraged to automate traditionally time-intensive assessment tasks (e.g., educational assessment), provide psychological information and care (e.g., chatbots), and when delivered remotely (e.g., by mobile phone or wearable sensors) promise underserved communities greater access to health care. Indeed, the automatic analysis of speech provides a wealth of information that can be used for patient care in a wide range of settings (e.g., mHealth applications) and for diverse purposes (e.g., behavioral and clinical research, medical tools that are implemented into practice) and patient types (e.g., numerous psychological disorders and in psychiatry and neurology). However, automation of speech analysis is a complex task that requires the integration of several different technologies within a large distributed process with numerous stakeholders. Many organizations have raised awareness about the need for robust systems for ensuring transparency, oversight, and regulation of technologies utilizing artificial intelligence. Since there is limited knowledge about the ethical and legal implications of these applications in psychological science, we provide a balanced view of both the optimism that is widely published on and also the challenges and risks of use, including discrimination and exacerbation of structural inequalities.

Using Generative Artificial Intelligence to Classify Primary Progressive Aphasia from Connected Speech.,"Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.",2023,,,"Rezaii, N; Quimby, M; Wong, B; Hochberg, D; Brickhouse, M; Touroutoglou, A; Dickerson, BC; Wolff, P"
Proxy-analysis of the genetics of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease through polygenic scores.,"Cognitive decline is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its genetic risk factors are not well known to date, besides variants in the GBA and APOE genes.

Taking an alternative approach, we computed 100 polygenic scores (PGS) related to cognitive, dementia, stroke, and brain anatomical phenotypes and investigated their association with cognitive decline in six longitudinal cohorts. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, genetic ancestry, follow-up duration, GBA and APOE status. Then, we meta-analyzed five of these cohorts, comprising a total of 1702 PD participants with 6156 visits, using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment as a cognitive outcome measure. After correction for multiple comparisons, we found four PGS significantly associated with cognitive decline: intelligence (p = 5.26e-13), cognitive performance (p = 1.46e-12), educational attainment (p = 8.52e-10), and reasoning (p = 3.58e-5). Survival analyses highlighted an offset of several years between the first and last quartiles of PGS, with significant differences for the PGS of cognitive performance (5 years) and educational attainment (7 years). In conclusion, we found four PGS associated with cognitive decline in PD, all associated with general cognitive phenotypes. This study highlights the common genetic factors between cognitive decline in PD and the general population, and the importance of the participant's cognitive reserve for cognitive outcome in PD.",2024,,,"Faouzi, J; Tan, M; Casse, F; Lesage, S; Tesson, C; Brice, A; Mangone, G; Mariani, LL; Iwaki, H; Colliot, O; Pihlstrøm, L; Corvol, JC"
A preliminary investigation on core lexicon analysis in dementia of the Alzheimer's type.,"Core lexicon (CL) analysis is a time efficient and possibly reliable measure that captures discourse production abilities. For people with aphasia, CL scores have demonstrated correlations with aphasia severity, as well as other discourse and linguistic measures. It was also found to be clinician-friendly and clinically sensitive enough to capture longitudinal changes in aphasia. To our knowledge, CL has never been investigated in individuals with neurologically progressive disease.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; core lexicon; dementia; discourse,,"Kintz, S; Kim, H; Wright, HH"
Subject Harmonization of Digital Biomarkers: Improved Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the early stage of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a crucial stage for therapeutic interventions and treatment. Early detection of MCI offers opportunities for early intervention and significantly benefits cohort enrichment for clinical trials. Imaging and in vivo markers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have high detection performance, yet their prohibitive costs and intrusiveness demand more affordable and accessible alternatives. The recent advances in digital biomarkers, especially language markers, have shown great potential, where variables informative to MCI are derived from linguistic and/or speech and later used for predictive modeling. A major challenge in modeling language markers comes from the variability of how each person speaks. As the cohort size for language studies is usually small due to extensive data collection efforts, the variability among persons makes language markers hard to generalize to unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel subject harmonization tool to address the issue of distributional differences in language markers across subjects, thus enhancing the generalization performance of machine learning models. Our empirical results show that machine learning models built on our harmonized features have improved prediction performance on unseen data.

Clinical course of pathologically confirmed corticobasal degeneration and corticobasal syndrome.,"The clinical presentation of corticobasal degeneration is diverse, while the background pathology of corticobasal syndrome is also heterogeneous. Therefore, predicting the pathological background of corticobasal syndrome is extremely difficult. Herein, we investigated the clinical findings and course in patients with pathologically, genetically and biochemically verified corticobasal degeneration and corticobasal syndrome with background pathology to determine findings suggestive of background disorder. Thirty-two patients were identified as having corticobasal degeneration. The median intervals from the initial symptoms to the onset of key milestones were as follows: gait disturbance, 0.0 year; behavioural changes, 1.0 year; falls, 2.0 years; cognitive impairment, 2.0 years; speech impairment, 2.5 years; supranuclear gaze palsy, 3.0 years; urinary incontinence, 3.0 years; and dysphagia, 5.0 years. The median survival time was 7.0 years; 50% of corticobasal degeneration was diagnosed as corticobasal degeneration/corticobasal syndrome at the final presentation.

Clinical dimensions along the non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia spectrum.,"It is debated whether primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) and progressive agrammatic aphasia (PAA) belong to the same clinical spectrum, traditionally termed non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), or exist as two completely distinct syndromic entities with specific pathologic/prognostic correlates. We analysed speech, language and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g. PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with aetiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated using linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS and six PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by non-fluent speech, executive dysfunction and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between frontotemporal lobar degeneration neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (0.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance [(i) severity-agrammatism; (ii) prominent AOS; and (iii) prominent dysarthria]. None of these data-driven LCDs allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",2024,apraxia of speech; corticobasal degeneration; dysarthria; magnetic resonance imaging; primary progressive aphasia; progressive supranuclear palsy,"Humans; Aphasia, Broca; Dysarthria; Apraxias; Language; Speech; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Primary Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia","Illán-Gala, I; Lorca-Puls, DL; Tee, BL; Ezzes, Z; de Leon, J; Miller, ZA; Rubio-Guerra, S; Santos-Santos, M; Gómez-Andrés, D; Grinberg, LT; Spina, S; Kramer, JH; Wauters, LD; Henry, ML; Boxer, AL; Rosen, HJ; Miller, BL; Seeley, WW; Mandelli, ML; Gorno-Tempini, ML"
The role of RLIP76 in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction: Evidence based on autopsy brains from Alzheimer's disease patients.,"Several converging lines of evidence from our group support a potential role of RLIP76 (AKA Rlip) in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the role of Rlip in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. The purpose of the present study is to determine the role of Rlip in the brains of AD patients and control subjects. To achieve our goals, we used frozen tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded postmortem brains from AD patients of different Braak stages and age-matched control subjects. Our immunohistology and immunoblotting blotting analysis revealed that expression of Rlip protein gradually and significantly decreased (p = 0.0001) with AD progression, being lowest in Braak stage IV-V.

Time-frequency analysis of speech signal using Chirplet transform for automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world after Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosing PD is challenging as it evolved slowly, and its symptoms eventuate gradually. Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in speech may be utilized as an excellent biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we have proposed a Chirplet transform (CT) based novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech signals. We employed CT to get the time-frequency matrix (TFM) of each speech recording, and we extracted time-frequency based entropy (TFE) features from the TFM. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the TFE features reflect the changes in speech that occurs in the speech due to PD, hence can be used for classifying the PD and healthy control (HC) individuals. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using the vowels and words from the PC-GITA database. The genetic algorithm is utilized to select the optimum features subset, while a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers are employed for classification. The TFE features outperform the breathiness and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features. The SVM classifier is most effective compared to other machine-learning classifiers. The highest classification accuracy rates of 98% and 99% are achieved using the vowel /a/ and word /atleta/, respectively. The results reveal that the proposed CT-based entropy features effectively diagnose PD using the speech of a person.",2023,Chirplet transform; Genetic algorithm; Parkinson’s disease (PD); Speech Pathology; Support vector machine; Time-frequency representation,,"Warule, P; Mishra, SP; Deb, S"

Dissociating memory and executive function impairment through temporal features in a word list verbal learning task.,"The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is an established verbal learning test commonly used to quantify memory impairments due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) both at a clinical dementia stage or prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Focal memory impairment-as quantified e.g. by the RAVLT-at an MCI stage is referred to as amnestic MCI (aMCI) and is often regarded as the cognitive phenotype of prodromal AD. However, recent findings suggest that not only learning and memory but also other cognitive domains, especially executive functions (EF) and processing speed (PS), influence verbal learning performance. This research investigates whether additional temporal features extracted from audio recordings from a participant's RAVLT response can better dissociate memory and EF in such tasks and eventually help to better describe MCI subtypes. 675 age-matched participants from the H70 Swedish birth cohort were included in this analysis; 68 participants were classified as MCI (33 aMCI and 35 due to executive impairment). RAVLT performances were recorded and temporal features extracted. Novel temporal features were correlated with established neuropsychological tests measuring EF and PS. Lastly, the downstream diagnostic potential of temporal features was estimated using group differences and a machine learning (ML) classification scenario. Temporal features correlated moderately with measures of EF and PS. Performance of an ML classifier could be improved by adding temporal features to traditional counts. We conclude that RAVLT temporal features are in general related to EF and that they might be capable of dissociating memory and EF in a word list learning task.",2023,Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; RAVLT; Speech analysis; Temporal analysis; aMCI; exMCI,,"Dörr, F; Schäfer, S; Öhman, F; Linz, N; Bodin, TH; Skoog, J; Zettergren, A; Kern, S; Skoog, I; Tröger, J"
From genetic correlations of Alzheimer's disease to classification with artificial neural network models.,"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder characterized by many risk loci with potential associations with different traits and diseases. AD, characterized by a progressive loss of neuronal functions, manifests with different symptoms such as decline in memory, movement, coordination, and speech. The mechanisms underlying the onset of AD are not always fully understood, but involve a multiplicity of factors. Early diagnosis of AD plays a central role as it can offer the possibility of early treatment, which can slow disease progression. Currently, the methods of diagnosis are cognitive testing, neuroimaging, or cerebrospinal fluid analysis that can be time-consuming, expensive, invasive, and not always accurate. In the present study, we performed a genetic correlation analysis using genome-wide association statistics from a large study of AD and UK Biobank, to examine the association of AD with other human traits and disorders. In addition, since hippocampus, a part of cerebral cortex could play a central role in several traits that are associated with AD; we analyzed the gene expression profiles of hippocampus of AD patients applying 4 different artificial neural network models. We found 65 traits correlated with AD grouped into 9 clusters: medical conditions, fluid intelligence, education, anthropometric measures, employment status, activity, diet, lifestyle, and sexuality. The comparison of different 4 neural network models along with feature selection methods on 5 Alzheimer's gene expression datasets showed that the simple basic neural network model obtains a better performance (66% of accuracy) than other more complex methods with dropout and weight regularization of the network.",2023,Alzheimer; Gene expression; Genetic correlation; Neural network,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Chromosome Mapping; Hippocampus; Neural Networks, Computer","Cava, C; D'Antona, S; Maselli, F; Castiglioni, I; Porro, D"
ADscreen: A speech processing-based screening system for automatic identification of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11 % of older adults in the United States. Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of patients with ADRD, >50 % of them are not diagnosed and unaware of their disease. To address this challenge, we developed ADscreen, an innovative speech-processing based ADRD screening algorithm for the protective identification of patients with ADRD. ADscreen consists of five major components: (i) noise reduction for reducing background noises from the audio-recorded patient speech, (ii) modeling the patient's ability in phonetic motor planning using acoustic parameters of the patient's voice, (iii) modeling the patient's ability in semantic and syntactic levels of language organization using linguistic parameters of the patient speech, (iv) extracting vocal and semantic psycholinguistic cues from the patient speech, and (v) building and evaluating the screening algorithm. To identify important speech parameters (features) associated with ADRD, we used the Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM), an effective feature selection method for high dimensional, small sample size datasets. Modeling the relationship between speech parameters and the outcome variable (presence/absence of ADRD) was conducted using three different machine learning (ML) architectures with the capability of joining informative acoustic and linguistic with contextual word embedding vectors obtained from the DistilBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We evaluated the performance of the ADscreen on an audio-recorded patients' speech (verbal description) for the Cookie-Theft picture description task, which is publicly available in the dementia databank. The joint fusion of acoustic and linguistic parameters with contextual word embedding vectors of DistilBERT achieved F1-score = 84.64 (standard deviation [std] = ±3.58) and AUC-ROC = 92.53 (std = ±3.34) for training dataset, and F1-score = 89.55 and AUC-ROC = 93.89 for the test dataset. In summary, ADscreen has a strong potential to be integrated with clinical workflow to address the need for an ADRD screening tool so that patients with cognitive impairment can receive appropriate and timely care.",2023,Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Screening algorithm; Speech analysis,Aged; Humans; Acoustics; Alzheimer Disease; Linguistics; Speech; Mass Screening,"Zolnoori, M; Zolnour, A; Topaz, M"

Participants with a first-degree family history of AD (FH+) and carrying the Ε4+ allele for the ApoE gene (ApoE ε4+) underwent retinal thickness analysis using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual function assessments, including visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), color perception, perception digital tests, and visual field analysis. Structural analysis divided participants into FH+ ApoE ε4+ and FH- ApoE ε4- groups, while functional analysis further categorized them by age (40-60 years and over 60 years). Over the 27-month follow-up, the FH+ ApoE ε4+ group exhibited thickness changes in all inner retinal layers. Comparing this group to the FH- ApoE ε4- group at 27 months revealed progressing changes in the inner nuclear layer. In the FH+ ApoE ε4+ 40-60 years group, no progression of visual function changes was observed, but an increase in VA and CS was maintained at 3 and 12 cycles per degree, respectively, compared to the group without AD risk at 27 months. In conclusion, cognitively healthy individuals at risk for AD demonstrated progressive retinal structural changes over the 27-month follow-up, while functional changes remained stable.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; ApoE ε4; contrast sensitivity; familiar history; genetic risk; optical coherence tomography; visual acuity,,"López-Cuenca, I; Sánchez-Puebla, L; Salobrar-García, E; Álvarez-Gutierrez, M; Elvira-Hurtado, L; Barabash, A; Ramírez-Toraño, F; Fernández-Albarral, JA; Matamoros, JA; Nebreda, A; García-Colomo, A; Ramírez, AI; Salazar, JJ; Gil, P; Maestú, F; Ramírez, JM; de Hoz, R"
Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living for Greek-Speaking Adults with Cognitive Impairment: A Psychometric Evaluation Study with Additional Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Analysis.,"One of the components of a dementia diagnosis is the assessment of functional abilities. These abilities are measured via screeners, such as the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale. The IADL scale is a valid tool that has been adapted in many languages. This study aimed to provide a cut-off point and validate the Greek version of the IADL scale in populations with cognitive impairment. IADL data were collected from 132 individuals: 24 PD patients, 24 Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) patients, and 24 AD patients. The remaining 60 participants were cognitive healthy adults (CHAs). The CHA group and the PD group served as the cognitively unimpaired group (CUG), while the PDD and AD groups served as the cognitively impaired group (CIG). Additionally, the MMSE, the AMTS, the Clock Drawing Test CDT, the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD), the NPI, and the GDS-15 were administered to the participants. Statistically significant differences in the IADL scores were exhibited between all subgroups. The IADL scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.890).

Phonological and Semantic Fluency in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Semantic and Phonological fluency (SF and PF) are routinely evaluated in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are disagreements in the literature regarding which fluency task is more affected while developing AD. Most studies focus on SF assessment, given its connection with the temporoparietal amnesic system. PF is less reported, it is related to working memory, which is also impaired in probable and diagnosed AD.

Explainable Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Linguistic Features from Automatic Speech Recognition.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia and can cause abnormal cognitive function and progressive loss of essential life skills. Early screening is thus necessary for the prevention and intervention of AD. Speech dysfunction is an early onset symptom of AD patients. Recent studies have demonstrated the promise of automated acoustic assessment using acoustic or linguistic features extracted from speech. However, most previous studies have relied on manual transcription of text to extract linguistic features, which weakens the efficiency of automated assessment. The present study thus investigates the effectiveness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in building an end-to-end automated speech analysis model for AD detection.",2023,ADReSS; Alzheimer’s disease; Automatic speech recognition; Ensemble learning; Linguistic features,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech Perception; Linguistics; Speech; Cognition,"Tang, L; Zhang, Z; Feng, F; Yang, LZ; Li, H"

Urgent needs of caregiving in ageing populations with Alzheimer's disease and other chronic conditions: Support our loved ones.,"The ageing process begins at birth. It is a life-long process, and its exact origins are still unknown. Several hypotheses attempt to describe the normal ageing process, including hormonal imbalance, formation of reactive oxygen species, DNA methylation & DNA damage accumulation, loss of proteostasis, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, senescence, inflammation, and stem cell depletion. With increased lifespan in elderly individuals, the prevalence of age-related diseases including, cancer, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, Parkinson's, and other mental illnesses are increased. These increased age-related illnesses, put tremendous pressure & burden on caregivers, family members, and friends who are living with patients with age-related diseases. As medical needs evolve, the caregiver is expected to experience an increase in duties and challenges, which may result in stress on themselves, and impact their own family life. In the current article, we assess the biological mechanisms of ageing and its effect on body systems, exploring lifestyle and ageing, with a specific focus on age-related disorders. We also discussed the history of caregiving and specific challenges faced by caregivers in the presence of multiple comorbidities. We also assessed innovative approaches to funding caregiving, and efforts to improve the medical system to better organize chronic care efforts, while improving the skill and efficiency of both informal and formal caregivers. We also discussed the role of caregiving in end-of-life care. Our critical analysis strongly suggests that there is an urgent need for caregiving in aged populations and support from local, state, and federal agencies.",2023,Age-related disorders; Ageing populations; And end-of-life care; Biological ageing; Caregiving; Palliative care,Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Aging; Caregivers,"Culberson, JW; Kopel, J; Sehar, U; Reddy, PH"

Rlip Reduction Induces Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Mutant Tau-Expressed Immortalized Hippocampal Neurons: Mechanistic Insights.,"RalBP1 (Rlip) is a stress-activated protein that is believed to play a large role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. The purpose of our study was to understand the role of Rlip in mutant Tau-expressed immortalized hippocampal HT22 cells. In the current study, we used mutant Tau (mTau)-expressed HT22 neurons and HT22 cells transfected with Rlip-cDNA and/or silenced RNA, and studied the cell survival, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial function, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analysis of synaptic and mitophagy proteins and the colocalization of Rlip and mTau proteins. We found Rlip protein levels were reduced in mTau-HT22 cells, Rlip silenced HT22 cells, and mTau + Rlip RNA silenced HT22 cells; on the other hand, increased Rlip levels were observed in Rlip cDNA transfected HT22 cells. We found cell survival was decreased in mTau-HT22 cells and RNA-silenced HT22 cells. However, cell survival was increased in Rlip-overexpressed mTau-HT22 cells. A significantly reduced oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was found in mTau-HT22 cells and in RNA-silenced Rlip-HT22 cells, with an even greater reduction in mTau-HT22 + Rlip RNA-silenced HT22 cells. A significantly increased OCR was found in Rlip-overexpressed HT22 cells and in all groups of cells that overexpress Rlip cDNA. Mitochondrial function was defective in mTau-HT22 cells, RNA silenced Rlip in HT22 cells, and was further defective in mTau-HT22 + Rlip RNA-silenced HT22 cells; however, it was rescued in Rlip overexpressed in all groups of HT22 cells. Synaptic and mitophagy proteins were decreased in mTau-HT22 cells, and further reductions were found in RNA-silenced mTau-HT22 cells. However, these were increased in mTau + Rlip-overexpressed HT22 cells. An increased number of mitochondria and decreased mitochondrial length were found in mTau-HT22 cells. These were rescued in Rlip-overexpressed mTau-HT22 cells. These observations strongly suggest that Rlip deficiency causes oxidative stress/mitochondrial dysfunction and Rlip overexpression reverses these defects. Overall, our findings revealed that Rlip is a promising new target for aging, AD, and other tauopathies/neurological diseases.",2023,Rlip deficiency; mitochondrial function; mitophagy; mutant Tau; oxygen consumption rate; phosphorylated tau,"Humans; DNA, Complementary; Alzheimer Disease; Neurons; Tauopathies; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; RNA; Hippocampus","Reddy, PH; Kshirsagar, S; Bose, C; Pradeepkiran, JA; Hindle, A; Singh, SP; Reddy, AP; Baig, J"
Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Speech and language changes occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few studies have characterized their longitudinal course. We analyzed open-ended speech samples from a prodromal-to-mild AD cohort to develop a novel composite score to characterize progressive speech changes. Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD. Speech-based composite scores could be used to monitor change and detect response to treatment in future research.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; digital biomarkers; language; mild cognitive impairment; natural language processing; speech,,"Robin, J; Xu, M; Balagopalan, A; Novikova, J; Kahn, L; Oday, A; Hejrati, M; Hashemifar, S; Negahdar, M; Simpson, W; Teng, E"

Reading and lexical-semantic retrieval tasks outperforms single task speech analysis in the screening of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,"Age-related cognitive impairment have increased dramatically in recent years, which has risen the interes in developing screening tools for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Speech analysis allows to exploit the behavioral consequences of cognitive deficits on the patient's vocal performance so that it is possible to identify pathologies affecting speech production such as dementia. Previous studies have further shown that the speech task used determines how the speech parameters are altered. We aim to combine the impairments in several speech production tasks in order to improve the accuracy of screening through speech analysis. The sample consists of 72 participants divided into three equal groups of healthy older adults, people with mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease, matched by age and education. A complete neuropsychological assessment and two voice recordings were performed. The tasks required the participants to read a text, and complete a sentence with semantic information. A stepwise linear discriminant analysis was performed to select speech parameters with discriminative power. The discriminative functions obtained an accuracy of 83.3% in simultaneous classifications of several levels of cognitive impairment. It would therefore be a promising screening tool for dementia.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Speech; Alzheimer Disease; Semantics; Reading; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests,"Martínez-Nicolás, I; Martínez-Sánchez, F; Ivanova, O; Meilán, JJG"
Distinguishable features of spontaneous speech in Alzheimer's clinical syndrome and healthy controls.,There is growing evidence that subtle changes in spontaneous speech may reflect early pathological changes in cognitive function.

The current study assessed whether Ostrand and Gunstad's (OG) lexical-semantic features extend to predicting cognitive status in a sample of individuals with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) and healthy controls.

The aim of this scoping review was to synthesize the current state of the evidence and identify gaps in the literature regarding functional activity performance and falls and their significance to disease staging (i.e., mild, moderate, and severe defined staging criteria) in relation to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in adults with DS.",2023,Down syndrome; aging; cognition; falls; function,,"Washington, SE; Cler, E; Lowery, C; Stark, SL"
Rlip overexpression reduces oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: Mechanistic insights.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects a large proportion of the aging population. RalBP1 (Rlip) is a stress-activated protein that plays a crucial role in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases but its precise role in the progression of AD is unclear. The purpose of our study is to understand the role of Rlip in the progression and pathogenesis of AD in mutant APP/amyloid beta (Aβ)-expressed mouse primary hippocampal (HT22) hippocampal neurons. In the current study, we used HT22 neurons that express mAPP, transfected with Rlip-cDNA and/or RNA silenced, and studied cell survival, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial function, immunoblotting & immunofluorescence analysis of synaptic and mitophagy protein's and colocalization of Rlip and mutant APP/Aβ proteins and mitochondrial length and number. We also assessed Rlip levels in autopsy brains from AD patients and control subjects. We found cell survival was decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA-silenced HT22 cells. However, cell survival was increased in Rlip-overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA-silenced Rlip-HT22 cells. OCR was increased in Rlip-overexpressed in mAPP-HT22 cells. Mitochondrial function was defective in mAPP-HT22 cells and RNA silenced Rlip in HT22 cells, however, it was rescued in Rlip overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Synaptic and mitophagy proteins were decreased in mAPP-HT22 cells, further reducing RNA-silenced Rlip-HT22 cells. However, these were increased in mAPP+Rlip-HT22 cells. Colocalization analysis revealed Rlip is colocalized with mAPP/Aβ. An increased number of mitochondria and decreased mitochondrial length were found in mAPP-HT22 cells. These were rescued in Rlip overexpressed mAPP-HT22 cells. Reduced Rlip levels were found in autopsy brains from AD patients. These observations strongly suggest that Rlip deficiency causes oxidative stress/mitochondrial dysfunction and Rlip overexpression reduced these defects.",2023,Amyloid beta; Mitochondrial function; Mitophagy; Mutant APP; Oxygen consumption rate; Rlip deficiency,Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Oxidative Stress; Mitochondria; RNA,"Reddy, PH; Kshirsagar, S; Bose, C; Pradeepkiran, JA; Hindle, A; Singh, SP; Reddy, AP"

Comprehension of acoustically degraded speech in Alzheimer's disease and primary progressive aphasia.,"Successful communication in daily life depends on accurate decoding of speech signals that are acoustically degraded by challenging listening conditions. This process presents the brain with a demanding computational task that is vulnerable to neurodegenerative pathologies. However, despite recent intense interest in the link between hearing impairment and dementia, comprehension of acoustically degraded speech in these diseases has been little studied. Here we addressed this issue in a cohort of 19 patients with typical Alzheimer's disease and 30 patients representing the three canonical syndromes of primary progressive aphasia (non-fluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia; semantic variant primary progressive aphasia; logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia), compared to 25 healthy age-matched controls. As a paradigm for the acoustically degraded speech signals of daily life, we used noise-vocoding: synthetic division of the speech signal into frequency channels constituted from amplitude-modulated white noise, such that fewer channels convey less spectrotemporal detail thereby reducing intelligibility. We investigated the impact of noise-vocoding on recognition of spoken three-digit numbers and used psychometric modelling to ascertain the threshold number of noise-vocoding channels required for 50% intelligibility by each participant. Associations of noise-vocoded speech intelligibility threshold with general demographic, clinical and neuropsychological characteristics and regional grey matter volume (defined by voxel-based morphometry of patients' brain images) were also assessed. Mean noise-vocoded speech intelligibility threshold was significantly higher in all patient groups than healthy controls, and significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease and logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia than semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (all P < 0.05). In a receiver operating characteristic analysis, vocoded intelligibility threshold discriminated Alzheimer's disease, non-fluent variant and logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia patients very well from healthy controls. Further, this central hearing measure correlated with overall disease severity but not with peripheral hearing or clear speech perception. Neuroanatomically, after correcting for multiple voxel-wise comparisons in predefined regions of interest, impaired noise-vocoded speech comprehension across syndromes was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with atrophy of left planum temporale, angular gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus: a cortical network that has previously been widely implicated in processing degraded speech signals. Our findings suggest that the comprehension of acoustically altered speech captures an auditory brain process relevant to daily hearing and communication in major dementia syndromes, with novel diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; auditory perception; degraded speech; frontotemporal dementia; primary progressive aphasia,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Comprehension; Speech; Brain; Aphasia; Aphasia, Primary Progressive; Neuropsychological Tests","Jiang, J; Johnson, JCS; Requena-Komuro, MC; Benhamou, E; Sivasathiaseelan, H; Chokesuwattanaskul, A; Nelson, A; Nortley, R; Weil, RS; Volkmer, A; Marshall, CR; Bamiou, DE; Warren, JD; Hardy, CJD"
Speech changes in old age: Methodological considerations for speech-based discrimination of healthy ageing and Alzheimer's disease.,"Recent evidence suggests that speech substantially changes in ageing. As a complex neurophysiological process, it can accurately reflect changes in the motor and cognitive systems underpinning human speech. Since healthy ageing is not always easily discriminable from early stages of dementia based on cognitive and behavioural hallmarks, speech is explored as a preclinical biomarker of pathological itineraries in old age. A greater and more specific impairment of neuromuscular activation, as well as  a specific cognitive and linguistic impairment in dementia, unchain discriminating changes in speech. Yet, there is no consensus on such discriminatory speech parameters, neither on how they should be elicited and assessed.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; automatic analysis; cognitive impairment; computational linguistics; dementia; healthy ageing; language; non-invasive assessment; speech,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech; Healthy Aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Linguistics,"Ivanova, O; Martínez-Nicolás, I; Meilán, JJG"
Application of Deep Learning in the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease-A Review.,"Most neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are life-threatening, critical, and incurable affecting mainly the elderly population. Early diagnosis is challenging as disease phenotype is very crucial for predicting, preventing the progression, and effective drug discovery. In the last few years, Deep learning (DL) based neural networks are the state-of-the-art models deployed in industries and academics across different areas like natural language processing, image analysis, speech recognition, audio classification, and many more. It has been slowly realized that they have a high potential in medical image analysis and diagnostics and medical management in general. As this field is vast and expanding rapidly, we have put focused on existing DL-based models to detect Alzheimer's and Parkinson's in particular. This study gives a summary of related medical examinations for these diseases. Frameworks and applications of many deep learning models have been discussed. We have given precise notes on pre-processing techniques used by various studies for MRI image analysis. An overview of the application of DL-based models in different stages of medical image analysis has been conferred. It has been realized from the review that more studies are focused on Alzheimer's compared to Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we have tabulated the various public datasets available for these diseases. We have highlighted the potential use of a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis of these disorders. Also, some challenges and issues in implementing deep learning techniques for the detection of these diseases have been addressed. Finally, we concluded with some directions for future research regarding deep learning in the diagnosis of these diseases.",2023,Alzheimer's; Deep learning; MRI; Neurodegenerative diseases; Parkinson's; biomarker; biomarkerNeurodegenerative diseases; pre-processing,,
Efficient Pause Extraction and Encode Strategy for Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Only Acoustic Features from Spontaneous Speech.,"Clinical studies have shown that speech pauses can reflect the cognitive function differences between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and non-AD patients, while the value of pause information in AD detection has not been fully explored. Herein, we propose a speech pause feature extraction and encoding strategy for only acoustic-signal-based AD detection. First, a voice activity detection (VAD) method was constructed to detect pause/non-pause feature and encode it to binary pause sequences that are easier to calculate. Then, an ensemble machine-learning-based approach was proposed for the classification of AD from the participants' spontaneous speech, based on the VAD Pause feature sequence and common acoustic feature sets (ComParE and eGeMAPS). The proposed pause feature sequence was verified in five machine-learning models. The validation data included two public challenge datasets (ADReSS and ADReSSo, English voice) and a local dataset (10 audio recordings containing five patients and five controls, Chinese voice). Results showed that the VAD Pause feature was more effective than common feature sets (ComParE: 6373 features and eGeMAPS: 88 features) for AD classification, and that the ensemble method improved the accuracy by more than 5% compared to several baseline methods (8% on the ADReSS dataset; 5.9% on the ADReSSo dataset). Moreover, the pause-sequence-based AD detection method could achieve 80% accuracy on the local dataset. Our study further demonstrated the potential of pause information in speech-based AD detection, and also contributed to a more accessible and general pause feature extraction and encoding method for AD detection.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease detection; ensemble machine learning; machine learning; speech pause feature; statistical analysis,,"Liu, J; Fu, F; Li, L; Yu, J; Zhong, D; Zhu, S; Zhou, Y; Liu, B; Li, J"
Progression of atypical parkinsonian syndromes: PROSPECT-M-UK study implications for clinical trials.,"The advent of clinical trials of disease-modifying agents for neurodegenerative disease highlights the need for evidence-based end point selection. Here we report the longitudinal PROSPECT-M-UK study of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and related disorders, to compare candidate clinical trial end points. In this multicentre UK study, participants were assessed with serial questionnaires, motor examination, neuropsychiatric and MRI assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Participants were classified by diagnosis at baseline and study end, into Richardson syndrome, PSP-subcortical (PSP-parkinsonism and progressive gait freezing subtypes), PSP-cortical (PSP-frontal, PSP-speech and language and PSP-CBS subtypes), MSA-parkinsonism, MSA-cerebellar, CBS with and without evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology and indeterminate syndromes. We calculated annual rate of change, with linear mixed modelling and sample sizes for clinical trials of disease-modifying agents, according to group and assessment type. Two hundred forty-three people were recruited [117 PSP, 68 CBS, 42 MSA and 16 indeterminate; 138 (56.8%) male; age at recruitment 68.7 ± 8.61 years]. One hundred and fifty-nine completed the 6-month assessment (82 PSP, 27 CBS, 40 MSA and 10 indeterminate) and 153 completed the 12-month assessment (80 PSP, 29 CBS, 35 MSA and nine indeterminate). Questionnaire, motor examination, neuropsychiatric and neuroimaging measures declined in all groups, with differences in longitudinal change between groups. Neuroimaging metrics would enable lower sample sizes to achieve equivalent power for clinical trials than cognitive and functional measures, often achieving N < 100 required for 1-year two-arm trials (with 80% power to detect 50% slowing). However, optimal outcome measures were disease-specific. In conclusion, phenotypic variance within PSP, CBS and MSA is a major challenge to clinical trial design. Our findings provide an evidence base for selection of clinical trial end points, from potential functional, cognitive, clinical or neuroimaging measures of disease progression.",2023,clinical trials; corticobasal syndrome; multiple system atrophy; progressive supranuclear palsy; sample size,"Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Female; Parkinsonian Disorders; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; Multiple System Atrophy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; United Kingdom","Street, D; Jabbari, E; Costantini, A; Jones, PS; Holland, N; Rittman, T; Jensen, MT; Chelban, V; Goh, YY; Guo, T; Heslegrave, AJ; Roncaroli, F; Klein, JC; Ansorge, O; Allinson, KSJ; Jaunmuktane, Z; Revesz, T; Warner, TT; Lees, AJ; Zetterberg, H; Russell, LL; Bocchetta, M; Rohrer, JD; Burn, DJ; Pavese, N; Gerhard, A; Kobylecki, C; Leigh, PN; Church, A; Hu, MTM; Houlden, H; Morris, H; Rowe, JB"

Hence, digital markers of language and speech may offer a method for screening of at-risk populations that are at the earliest stages of AD, eventually in combination with advanced machine learning.

Associations Between Thinner Retinal Neuronal Layers and Suboptimal Brain Structural Integrity in a Middle-Aged Cohort.,The retina has potential as a biomarker of brain health and Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it is the only part of the central nervous system which can be easily imaged and has advantages over brain imaging technologies. Few studies have compared retinal and brain measurements in a middle-aged sample. The objective of our study was to investigate whether retinal neuronal measurements were associated with structural brain measurements in a middle-aged population-based cohort.,2023,Alzheimer’s; brain aging; magnetic resonance imaging; optical coherence tomography; retina,,"Barrett-Young, A; Abraham, WC; Cheung, CY; Gale, J; Hogan, S; Ireland, D; Keenan, R; Knodt, AR; Melzer, TR; Moffitt, TE; Ramrakha, S; Tham, YC; Wilson, GA; Wong, TY; Hariri, AR; Poulton, R"
Varied performance of picture description task as a screening tool across MCI subtypes.,"A picture description task is a component of Miro Health's platform for self-administration of neurobehavioral assessments. Picture description has been used as a screening tool for identification of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but currently requires in-person administration and scoring by someone with access to and familiarity with a scoring rubric. The Miro Health implementation allows broader use of this assessment through self-administration and automated processing, analysis, and scoring to deliver clinically useful quantifications of the users' speech production, vocal characteristics, and language. Picture description responses were collected from 62 healthy controls (HC), and 33 participants with MCI: 18 with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 15 with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). Speech and language features and contrasts between pairs of features were evaluated for differences in their distributions in the participant subgroups. Picture description features were selected and combined using penalized logistic regression to form risk scores for classification of HC versus MCI as well as HC versus specific MCI subtypes. A picture-description based risk score distinguishes MCI and HC with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.74. When contrasting specific subtypes of MCI and HC, the classifiers have an AUROC of 0.88 for aMCI versus HC and and AUROC of 0.61 for naMCI versus HC. Tests of association of individual features or contrasts of pairs of features with HC versus aMCI identified 20 features with p-values below 5e-3 and False Discovery Rates (FDRs) at or below 0.113, and 61 contrasts with p-values below 5e-4 and FDRs at or below 0.132. Findings suggest that performance of picture description as a screening tool for MCI detection will vary greatly by MCI subtype or by the proportion of various subtypes in an undifferentiated MCI population.",2023,,,"Mefford, JA; Zhao, Z; Heilier, L; Xu, M; Zhou, G; Mace, R; Sloane, KL; Sheppard, SM; Glenn, S"
Evaluating the Association Between Genetically Proxied Neurodevelopmental Language Phenotypes and the Risk of Primary Progressive Aphasia.,"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome of progressive language decline.

The effects of white matter hyperintensities on MEG power spectra in population with mild cognitive impairment.,"Cerebrovascular disease is responsible for up to 20% of cases of dementia worldwide, but also it is a major comorbid contributor to the progression of other neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are the most prevalent imaging marker in cerebrovascular disease. The presence and progression of WMH in the brain have been associated with general cognitive impairment and the risk to develop all types of dementia. The aim of this piece of work is the assessment of brain functional differences in an MCI population based on the WMH volume. One-hundred and twenty-nine individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent a neuropsychological evaluation, MRI assessment (T1 and Flair), and MEG recordings (5 min of eyes closed resting state). Those participants were further classified into vascular MCI (vMCI; ",2023,cerebrovascular disease (CVD); magnetoencephalography (MEG); mild cognitive impairment; power spectra analysis; small vessel cerebral disease; white matter hyperintensites,,"Torres-Simon, L; Cuesta, P; Del Cerro-Leon, A; Chino, B; Orozco, LH; Marsh, EB; Gil, P; Maestu, F"

Early visual alterations in individuals at-risk of Alzheimer's disease: a multidisciplinary approach.,"The earliest pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) appear decades before the clinical symptoms. The pathology affects the brain and the eye, leading to retinal structural changes and functional visual alterations. Healthy individuals at high risk of developing AD present alterations in these ophthalmological measures, as well as in resting-state electrophysiological activity. However, it is unknown whether the ophthalmological alterations are related to the visual-related electrophysiological activity. Elucidating this relationship is paramount to understand the mechanisms underlying the early deterioration of the system and an important step in assessing the suitability of these measures as early biomarkers of disease.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; At risk for AD; Magnetoencephalography; Optical coherence tomography; Visual function,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Retina; Visual Acuity; Brain; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Biomarkers","López-Cuenca, I; Nebreda, A; García-Colomo, A; Salobrar-García, E; de Frutos-Lucas, J; Bruña, R; Ramírez, AI; Ramirez-Toraño, F; Salazar, JJ; Barabash, A; Gil, P; Maestú, F; Ramírez, JM; de Hoz, R"

Semantic Coherence Dataset: Speech transcripts.,"The Semantic Coherence Dataset has been designed to experiment with semantic coherence metrics. More specifically, the dataset has been built to the ends of testing whether probabilistic measures, such as perplexity, provide stable scores to analyze spoken language. Perplexity, which was originally conceived as an information-theoretic measure to assess the probabilistic inference properties of language models, has recently been proven to be an appropriate tool to categorize speech transcripts based on semantic coherence accounts. More specifically, perplexity has been successfully employed to discriminate subjects suffering from Alzheimer Disease and healthy controls. Collected data include speech transcripts, intended to investigate semantic coherence at different levels: data are thus arranged into two classes, to investigate ",2023,Inter-subject semantic reliability; Intra-subject semantic reliability; Language models; Perplexity metrics; Speech transcripts; Spoken language analysis,,"Colla, D; Delsanto, M; Radicioni, DP"

The clinical and molecular spectrum of ZFYVE26-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia: SPG15.,"In the field of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), progress in molecular diagnostics needs to be translated into robust phenotyping studies to understand genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and to support interventional trials. ZFYVE26-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP-ZFYVE26, SPG15) is a rare, early-onset complex HSP, characterized by progressive spasticity and a variety of other neurological symptoms. While prior reports, often in populations with high rates of consanguinity, have established a general phenotype, there is a lack of systematic investigations and a limited understanding of age-dependent manifestation of symptoms. Here we delineate the clinical, neuroimaging and molecular features of 44 individuals from 36 families, the largest cohort assembled to date. Median age at last follow-up was 23.8 years covering a wide age range (11-61 years). While symptom onset often occurred in early childhood [median: 24 months, interquartile range (IQR) = 24], a molecular diagnosis was reached at a median age of 18.8 years (IQR = 8), indicating significant diagnostic delay. We demonstrate that most patients present with motor and/or speech delay or learning disabilities. Importantly, these developmental symptoms preceded the onset of motor symptoms by several years. Progressive spasticity in the lower extremities, the hallmark feature of HSP-ZFYVE26, typically presents in adolescence and involves the distal lower limbs before progressing proximally. Spasticity in the upper extremities was seen in 64%. We found a high prevalence of extrapyramidal movement disorders including cerebellar ataxia (64%) and dystonia (11%). Parkinsonism (16%) was present in a subset and showed no sustained response to levodopa. Cognitive decline and neurogenic bladder dysfunction progressed over time in most patients. A systematic analysis of brain MRI features revealed a common diagnostic signature consisting of thinning of the anterior corpus callosum, signal changes of the anterior forceps and non-specific cortical and cerebellar atrophy. The molecular spectrum included 45 distinct variants, distributed across the protein structure without mutational hotspots. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale scores, SPATAX Disability Scores and the Four Stage Functional Mobility Score showed moderate strength in representing the proportion of variation between disease duration and motor dysfunction. Plasma neurofilament light chain levels were significantly elevated in all patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.0001) and were correlated inversely with age (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = -0.65, P = 0.01). In summary, our systematic cross-sectional analysis of HSP-ZFYVE26 patients across a wide age-range, delineates core clinical, neuroimaging and molecular features and identifies markers of disease severity. These results raise awareness to this rare disease, facilitate an early diagnosis and create clinical trial readiness.",2023,ataxia; hereditary spastic paraplegia; movement disorders; speech delay; thin corpus callosum,"Humans; Child, Preschool; Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delayed Diagnosis; Proteins; Mutation","Saffari, A; Kellner, M; Jordan, C; Rosengarten, H; Mo, A; Zhang, B; Strelko, O; Neuser, S; Davis, MY; Yoshikura, N; Futamura, N; Takeuchi, T; Nabatame, S; Ishiura, H; Tsuji, S; Aldeen, HS; Cali, E; Rocca, C; Houlden, H; Efthymiou, S; Assmann, B; Yoon, G; Trombetta, BA; Kivisäkk, P; Eichler, F; Nan, H; Takiyama, Y; Tessa, A; Santorelli, FM; Sahin, M; Blackstone, C; Yang, E; Schüle, R; Ebrahimi-Fakhari, D"

Pyrimidines: Molecular docking and inhibition studies on carbonic anhydrase and cholinesterases.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. The disease is characterized by dementia, memory impairment, cognitive impairment, and speech impairment. Cholinesterases (ChEs; AChE, acetylcholinesterase and BChE, butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitors and their benefits of cholinergic replacement in the treatment of AD have been researched and documented by scientists in various ways to date. Recent studies prove that human carbonic anhydrases (hCAs) are also one of the important targets in the treatment of AD. Therefore, the development of new agents that can simultaneously modulate the various mechanisms or targets involved in the AD pathway may be a powerful strategy to treat AD, the current disease. Considering these data, the effects of the pyrimidines (1-7) were investigated in this study for the discovery and development of multitargeted ChEs and hCAs inhibitors associated with AD. In addition, the molecular docking analysis of the 4-amino-2-choloropyrimidine (2) was performed to understand the binding interactions on the active site of the enzyme. All compounds (1-7) showed satisfactory enzyme inhibitory potency in micromolar concentrations against AChE, BChE, hCAI, and hCAII with K",2023,biological activity; enzymes; inhibition; molecular docking; pyrimidine,Humans; Butyrylcholinesterase; Acetylcholinesterase; Molecular Docking Simulation; Carbonic Anhydrases; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Pyrimidines; Molecular Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship,"Duran, HE"
