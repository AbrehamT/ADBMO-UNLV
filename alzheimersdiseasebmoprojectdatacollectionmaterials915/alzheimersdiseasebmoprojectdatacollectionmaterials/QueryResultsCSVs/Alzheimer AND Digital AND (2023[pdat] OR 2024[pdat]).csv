A pathologic study of Perivascular pTDP-43 Lin bodies in LATE-NC.,"TAR DNA-Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) pathological inclusions are a distinctive feature in dozens of neurodegenerative pathologies, including limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). Prior investigations identified vascular-associated TDP-43-positive micro-lesions, known as ""Lin bodies,"" located on or near the brain capillaries of some individuals with LATE-NC. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the accumulation of Lin bodies and glial cells in LATE-NC and the potential co-localization with ferritin, a protein associated with iron storage. Using multiplexed immunohistochemistry and digital pathology tools, we conducted pathological analyses to investigate the relationship between Lin bodies and glial markers (GFAP for astrocytes, IBA1 for microglia) and ferritin. Analyses were conducted on post-mortem brain tissues collected from individuals with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes (ADNC) and LATE-NC.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Astrocyte; Iron; LATE-NC; Microglia; TDP-43,"Humans; Male; Female; DNA-Binding Proteins; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain; Ferritins; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Inclusion Bodies; Alzheimer Disease; Astrocytes; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Neuroglia; Middle Aged; Dementia","Shahidehpour, RK; Nelson, PT; Bachstetter, AD"

Optimized efficient attention-based network for facial expressions analysis in neurological health care.,"Facial Expression Analysis (FEA) plays a vital role in diagnosing and treating early-stage neurological disorders (NDs) like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Manual FEA is hindered by expertise, time, and training requirements, while automatic methods confront difficulties with real patient data unavailability, high computations, and irrelevant feature extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach: an efficient, lightweight convolutional block attention module (CBAM) based deep learning network (DLN) to aid doctors in diagnosing ND patients. The method comprises two stages: data collection of real ND patients, and pre-processing, involving face detection and an attention-enhanced DLN for feature extraction and refinement. Extensive experiments with validation on real patient data showcase compelling performance, achieving an accuracy of up to 73.2%. Despite its efficacy, the proposed model is lightweight, occupying only 3MB, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained mobile healthcare devices. Moreover, the method exhibits significant advancements over existing FEA approaches, holding tremendous promise in effectively diagnosing and treating ND patients. By accurately recognizing emotions and extracting relevant features, this approach empowers medical professionals in early ND detection and management, overcoming the challenges of manual analysis and heavy models. In conclusion, this research presents a significant leap in FEA, promising to enhance ND diagnosis and care.The code and data used in this work are available at: https://github.com/munsif200/Neurological-Health-Care.",2024,Deep learning; Facial expression analysis; Information processing; Mobile health care; Neurological disorder; Parkinson,,"Munsif, M; Sajjad, M; Ullah, M; Tarekegn, AN; Cheikh, FA; Tsakanikas, P; Muhammad, K"
Identification of Parkinson's disease PACE subtypes and repurposing treatments through integrative analyses of multimodal data.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder marked by significant clinical and progression heterogeneity. This study aimed at addressing heterogeneity of PD through integrative analysis of various data modalities. We analyzed clinical progression data (≥5 years) of individuals with de novo PD using machine learning and deep learning, to characterize individuals' phenotypic progression trajectories for PD subtyping. We discovered three pace subtypes of PD exhibiting distinct progression patterns: the Inching Pace subtype (PD-I) with mild baseline severity and mild progression speed; the Moderate Pace subtype (PD-M) with mild baseline severity but advancing at a moderate progression rate; and the Rapid Pace subtype (PD-R) with the most rapid symptom progression rate. We found cerebrospinal fluid P-tau/α-synuclein ratio and atrophy in certain brain regions as potential markers of these subtypes. Analyses of genetic and transcriptomic profiles with network-based approaches identified molecular modules associated with each subtype. For instance, the PD-R-specific module suggested STAT3, FYN, BECN1, APOA1, NEDD4, and GATA2 as potential driver genes of PD-R. It also suggested neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, metabolism, PI3K/AKT, and angiogenesis pathways as potential drivers for rapid PD progression (i.e., PD-R). Moreover, we identified repurposable drug candidates by targeting these subtype-specific molecular modules using network-based approach and cell line drug-gene signature data. We further estimated their treatment effects using two large-scale real-world patient databases; the real-world evidence we gained highlighted the potential of metformin in ameliorating PD progression. In conclusion, this work helps better understand clinical and pathophysiological complexity of PD progression and accelerate precision medicine.",2024,,,"Su, C; Hou, Y; Xu, J; Xu, Z; Zhou, M; Ke, A; Li, H; Xu, J; Brendel, M; Maasch, JRMA; Bai, Z; Zhang, H; Zhu, Y; Cincotta, MC; Shi, X; Henchcliffe, C; Leverenz, JB; Cummings, J; Okun, MS; Bian, J; Cheng, F; Wang, F"
"Identification of retinal oligomeric, citrullinated, and other tau isoforms in early and advanced AD and relations to disease status.","This study investigates various pathological tau isoforms in the retina of individuals with early and advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD), exploring their connection with disease status. Retinal cross-sections from predefined superior-temporal and inferior-temporal subregions and corresponding brains from neuropathologically confirmed AD patients with a clinical diagnosis of either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (n = 45) were compared with retinas from age- and sex-matched individuals with normal cognition (n = 30) and non-AD dementia (n = 4). Retinal tau isoforms, including tau tangles, paired helical filament of tau (PHF-tau), oligomeric-tau (Oligo-tau), hyperphosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and citrullinated-tau (Cit-tau), were stereologically analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Nanostring GeoMx digital spatial profiling, and correlated with clinical and neuropathological outcomes.

Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy in the oldest old: a population-based study.,"Population-based cohort studies are essential for understanding the pathological basis of dementia in older populations. Previous studies have shown that limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC) increases with age, but there have been only a few studies, which have investigated this entity in a population-based setting. Here we studied the frequency of LATE-NC and its associations with other brain pathologies and cognition in a population aged ≥ 85 years. The population-based Vantaa 85+ study cohort includes all 601 individuals aged ≥ 85 years who were living in Vantaa, Finland in 1991. A neuropathological examination was performed on 304 subjects (50.5%) and LATE-NC staging was possible in 295 of those. Dementia status and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were defined in the baseline study and 3 follow-ups (1994-99). The LATE-NC stages were determined based on TDP-43 immunohistochemistry, according to recently updated recommendations. Arteriolosclerosis was digitally assessed by calculating the average sclerotic index of five random small arterioles in amygdala and hippocampal regions, and frontal white matter. The association of LATE-NC with arteriolosclerosis and previously determined neuropathological variables including Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (ADNC), Lewy-related pathology (LRP), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and cognitive variables were analysed by Fisher's exact test, linear and logistic regression (univariate and multivariate) models. LATE-NC was found in 189 of 295 subjects (64.1%). Stage 2 was the most common (28.5%) and stage 3 the second most common (12.9%), whereas stages 1a, 1b and 1c were less common (9.5%, 5.1% and 8.1%, respectively). Stages 1a (P < 0.01), 2 (P < 0.001) and 3 (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with dementia and lower MMSE scores. LATE-NC was associated with ADNC (P < 0.001), HS (P < 0.001), diffuse neocortical LRP (P < 0.002), and arteriolosclerosis in amygdala (P < 0.02). In most cases LATE-NC occurred in combination alongside other neuropathological changes. There were only six subjects with dementia who had LATE-NC without high levels of ADNC or LRP (2% of the cohort, 3% of the cases with dementia), and five of these had HS. In all multivariate models, LATE-NC was among the strongest independent predictors of dementia. When LATE-NC and ADNC were assessed in a multivariate model without other dementia-associated pathologies, the attributable risk was higher for LATE-NC than ADNC (24.2% vs. 18.6%). This population-based study provides evidence that LATE-NC is very common and one of the most significant determinants of dementia in the general late-life aged population.",2024,autopsy; mixed pathology; multivariate analysis; neurodegeneration; neuropathology; very old,,"Mikhailenko, E; Colangelo, K; Tuimala, J; Kero, M; Savola, S; Raunio, A; Kok, EH; Tanskanen, M; Mäkelä, M; Puttonen, H; Mäyränpää, MI; Kumar, D; Kaivola, K; Paetau, A; Tienari, PJ; Polvikoski, T; Myllykangas, L"

The Value of a Virtual Assistant to Improve Engagement in Computerized Cognitive Training at Home: Exploratory Study.,"Impaired cognitive function is observed in many pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. At present, the pharmaceutical treatments available to counter cognitive decline have only modest effects, with significant side effects. A nonpharmacological treatment that has received considerable attention is computerized cognitive training (CCT), which aims to maintain or improve cognitive functioning through repeated practice in standardized exercises. CCT allows for more regular and thorough training of cognitive functions directly at home, which represents a significant opportunity to prevent and fight cognitive decline. However, the presence of assistance during training seems to be an important parameter to improve patients' motivation and adherence to treatment. To compensate for the absence of a therapist during at-home CCT, a relevant option could be to include a virtual assistant to accompany patients throughout their training.",2024,Alzheimer disease; THERADIA; artificial intelligence; cognitive decline; cognitive disorders; cognitive training; conversational agent; digital therapies; mild cognitive impairment; social interaction; virtual health assistant,,"Zsoldos, I; Trân, E; Fournier, H; Tarpin-Bernard, F; Fruitet, J; Fouillen, M; Bailly, G; Elisei, F; Bouchot, B; Constant, P; Ringeval, F; Koenig, O; Chainay, H"

Co-registration of MALDI-MSI and histology demonstrates gangliosides co-localize with amyloid beta plaques in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by impaired cognitive function and behavioral alterations. While AD research historically centered around mis-folded proteins, advances in mass spectrometry techniques have triggered increased exploration of the AD lipidome with lipid dysregulation emerging as a critical player in AD pathogenesis. Gangliosides are a class of glycosphingolipids enriched within the central nervous system. Previous work has suggested a shift in a-series gangliosides from complex (GM1) to simple (GM2 and GM3) species may be related to the development of neurodegenerative disease. In addition, complex gangliosides with 20 carbon sphingosine chains have been shown to increase in the aging brain. In this study, we utilized matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to interrogate the in situ relationship of a-series gangliosides with either 18 or 20 carbon sphingosine chains (d18:1 or d20:1, respectively) in the post-mortem human AD brain. Here, we expanded upon previous literature and demonstrated a significant decrease in the GM1 d20:1 to GM1 d18:1 ratio in regions of the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex in AD relative to control brain tissue. Then, we demonstrated that the MALDI-MSI profile of GM3 co-localizes with histologically confirmed amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and found a significant increase in both GM1 and GM3 in proximity to Aβ plaques. Collectively, this study demonstrates a perturbation of the ganglioside profile in AD, and validates a pipeline for MALDI-MSI and classic histological staining in the same tissue sections. This demonstrates feasibility for integrating untargeted mass spectrometry imaging approaches into a digital pathology framework.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Digital pathology; Gangliosides; Lipids; MALDI-MSI,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gangliosides; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Plaque, Amyloid; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain; Male; Female","Ollen-Bittle, N; Pejhan, S; Pasternak, SH; Keene, CD; Zhang, Q; Whitehead, SN"

Beyond Macrostructure: Is There a Role for Radiomics Analysis in Neuroimaging ?,"The most commonly used neuroimaging biomarkers of brain structure, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases, have traditionally been summary measurements from ROIs derived from structural MRI, such as volume and thickness. Advances in MR acquisition techniques, including high-field imaging, and emergence of learning-based methods have opened up opportunities to interrogate brain structure in finer detail, allowing investigators to move beyond macrostructural measurements. On the one hand, superior signal contrast has the potential to make appearance-based metrics that directly analyze intensity patterns, such as texture analysis and radiomics features, more reliable. Quantitative MRI, particularly at high-field, can also provide a richer set of measures with greater interpretability. On the other hand, use of neural networks-based techniques has the potential to exploit subtle patterns in images that can now be mined with advanced imaging. Finally, there are opportunities for integration of multimodal data at different spatial scales that is enabled by developments in many of the above techniques-for example, by combining digital histopathology with high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo MRI. Some of these approaches are at early stages of development and present their own set of challenges. Nonetheless, they hold promise to drive the next generation of validation and biomarker studies. This article will survey recent developments in this area, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. However, most of the discussion is equally relevant to imaging of other neurological disorders, and even to other organ systems of interest. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review of the available literature, but rather presented as a summary of recent trends through the discussion of a collection of representative studies with an eye towards what the future may hold.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; deep learning; neural networks; neurodegenerative disorders; radiomics,"Humans; Neuroimaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Biomarkers; Neural Networks, Computer; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiomics","Das, SR; Ilesanmi, A; Wolk, DA; Gee, JC"

A Novel Computerized Cognitive Test for the Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Its Association with Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Prone Brain Regions.,"During the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative changes can be identified by measuring volumetric loss in AD-prone brain regions on MRI. Cognitive assessments that are sensitive enough to measure the early brain-behavior manifestations of AD and that correlate with biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to identify and monitor individuals at risk for dementia. Weak sensitivity to early cognitive change has been a major limitation of traditional cognitive assessments. In this study, we focused on expanding our previous work by determining whether a digitized cognitive stress test, the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning, Brief Computerized Version (LASSI-BC) could differentiate between Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) groups. A second focus was to correlate LASSI-BC performance to volumetric reductions in AD-prone brain regions. Data was gathered from 111 older adults who were comprehensively evaluated and administered the LASSI-BC. Eighty-seven of these participants (51 CU; 36 aMCI) underwent MR imaging. The volumes of 12 AD-prone brain regions were related to LASSI-BC and other memory tests correcting for False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results indicated that, even after adjusting for initial learning ability, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) on the LASSI-BC differentiated between CU and aMCI groups. An optimal combination of frPSI and initial learning strength on the LASSI-BC yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.876 (76.1% sensitivity, 82.7% specificity). Further, frPSI on the LASSI-BC was associated with volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and posterior cingulate.",2023,Cortical Thickness; LASSI-L; MRI Volume; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Proactive Semantic Interference,,"Curiel Cid, RE; Zheng, DD; Kitaigorodsky, M; Adjouadi, M; Crocco, EA; Georgiou, M; Gonzalez-Jimenez, C; Ortega, A; Goryawala, M; Nagornaya, N; Pattany, P; Sfakianaki, E; Visser, U; Loewenstein, DA"

Digital cognitive assessments as low-burden markers for predicting future cognitive decline and tau accumulation across the Alzheimer's spectrum.,"Digital cognitive assessments, particularly those that can be done at home, present as low burden biomarkers for participants and patients alike, but their effectiveness in diagnosis of Alzheimer's or predicting its trajectory is still unclear. Here, we assessed what utility or added value these digital cognitive assessments provide for identifying those at high risk for cognitive decline. We analyzed >500 ADNI participants who underwent a brief digital cognitive assessment and Aβ/tau PET scans, examining their ability to distinguish cognitive status and predict cognitive decline. Performance on the digital cognitive assessment were superior to both cortical Aβ and entorhinal tau in detecting mild cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline, with mnemonic discrimination deficits emerging as the most critical measure for predicting decline and future tau accumulation. Digital assessments are effective in identifying at-risk individuals, supporting their utility as low-burden tools for early Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.",2024,,,"Vanderlip, CR; Stark, CEL"

Value-based motivational strategies combined with technology to encourage a lifestyle that helps to prevent dementia.,"Lifestyles aimed at reducing dementia risk typically combine physical and cognitive training, nutritional adaptations, and, potentially, an augmentation in social interactions. Interventions at the population level are essential but should be complemented by individual efforts. For efficacy, lasting changes to an individual's lifestyle are needed, necessitating robust motivation and volition. Acting in accordance with one's values is assumed to be rewarding, leading to improved motivation and volition, and produces stable behaviour-outcome relationships. To this end, future preventive endeavours might first evaluate an individual's extant lifestyle, preferences, and values, including considerations of age-related changes to ensure these values remain a motivational source. Digital technology can support lifestyle goals and be targeted to support an individual's values. A digital platform could implement situation-specific, sensing-based feedback to alert users to a target situation (eg, opportunity for exercise) coupled with (smartphone-based) feedback on the extent of accomplished behavioural change to support individually set goals and facilitate their adjustment depending on whether these goals are achieved. This use of the motivational impetus of values, coupled with interpersonal techniques, such as motivational interviewing and SMART goal setting, in combination with sensor technology and just-in-time adaptive interventions, is assumed to hold high potential for dementia prevention.",2024,,Humans; Dementia; Motivation; Life Style,"Klöppel, S; Brill, E; Frisoni, GB; Aarsland, D; Klusmann-Weißkopf, V"

3-Way hybrid analysis using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive impairment and ultimately death. To select the most effective treatment options, it is crucial to diagnose and classify the disease early, as current treatments can only delay its progression. However, previous research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has had limitations, such as inaccuracies and reliance on a small, unbalanced binary dataset. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the early stages of AD using three multiclass datasets: OASIS, EEG, and ADNI MRI. The research consisted of three phases: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification using hybrid learning techniques. For the OASIS and ADNI MRI datasets, we computed the mean RGB value and used an averaging filter to enhance the images. We balanced and augmented the dataset to increase its size. In the case of the EEG dataset, we applied a band-pass filter for digital filtering to reduce noise and also balanced the dataset using random oversampling. To extract and classify features, we utilized a hybrid technique consisting of four algorithms: AlexNet-MLP, AlexNet-ETC, AlexNet-AdaBoost, and AlexNet-NB. The results showed that the AlexNet-ETC hybrid algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate of 95.32% for the OASIS dataset. In the case of the EEG dataset, the AlexNet-MLP hybrid algorithm outperformed other approaches with the highest accuracy of 97.71%. For the ADNI MRI dataset, the AlexNet-MLP hybrid algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 92.59%. Comparing these results with the current state of the art demonstrates the effectiveness of our findings.",2024,Alzheimer’s; EEG; Early diagnosis; MRI; OASIS,,"Chen, X; Zeng, D; Mehmood, A; Khan, R; Shahid, F; Ibrahim, MM"
ClinicalGAN: powering patient monitoring in clinical trials with patient digital twins.,"Conducting clinical trials is becoming increasingly challenging lately due to spiraling costs, increased time to market, and high failure rates. Patient recruitment and retention is one of the key challenges that impact 90% of the trials directly. While a lot of attention has been given to optimizing patient recruitment, limited progress has been made towards developing comprehensive clinical trial monitoring systems to determine patients at risk and potentially improve patient retention through the right intervention at the right time. Earlier research in patient retention primarily focused on using deterministic frameworks to model the inherently stochastic patient journey process. Existing generative approaches to model temporal data such as TimeGAN or CRBM , face challenges and fail to address key requirements such as personalized generation, variable patient journey, and multi-variate time-series needed to model patient digital twin. In response to these challenges, current research proposes ClinicalGAN to enable patient level generation, effectively creating a patient's digital twin. ClinicalGAN provides capabilities for: (a) patient-level personalized generation by utilizing patient meta-data for conditional generation; (b) dynamic termination prediction to enable pro-active patient monitoring for improved patient retention; (c) multi-variate time-series training to incorporate relationship and dependencies among different tests measures captured during patient journey. The proposed solution is validated on two Alzheimer's clinical trial datasets and the results are benchmarked across multiple dimensions of generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed ClinicalGAN outperforms the SOTA approach by 3-4 ",2024,Clinical trials; GAN; Generative AI; Monitoring,Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Patient Selection,"Chandra, S; Prakash, PKS; Samanta, S; Chilukuri, S"

A wearable sensor and machine learning estimate step length in older adults and patients with neurological disorders.,"Step length is an important diagnostic and prognostic measure of health and disease. Wearable devices can estimate step length continuously (e.g., in clinic or real-world settings), however, the accuracy of current estimation methods is not yet optimal. We developed machine-learning models to estimate step length based on data derived from a single lower-back inertial measurement unit worn by 472 young and older adults with different neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. Studying more than 80,000 steps, the best model showed high accuracy for a single step (root mean square error, RMSE = 6.08 cm, ICC(2,1) = 0.89) and higher accuracy when averaged over ten consecutive steps (RMSE = 4.79 cm, ICC(2,1) = 0.93), successfully reaching the predefined goal of an RMSE below 5 cm (often considered the minimal-clinically-important-difference). Combining machine-learning with a single, wearable sensor generates accurate step length measures, even in patients with neurologic disease. Additional research may be needed to further reduce the errors in certain conditions.",2024,,,"Zadka, A; Rabin, N; Gazit, E; Mirelman, A; Nieuwboer, A; Rochester, L; Del Din, S; Pelosin, E; Avanzino, L; Bloem, BR; Della Croce, U; Cereatti, A; Hausdorff, JM"
Beyond Frequency Bands: Complementary-Ensemble-Empirical-Mode-Decomposition-Enhanced Microstate Sequence Non-Randomness Analysis for Aiding Diagnosis and Cognitive Prediction of Dementia.,"Exploring the spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for interpreting dementia and related cognitive decline. Spatiotemporal patterns of EEG can be described through microstate analysis, which provides a discrete approximation of the continuous electric field patterns generated by the brain cortex. Here, we propose a novel microstate spatiotemporal dynamic indicator, termed the microstate sequence non-randomness index (MSNRI). The essence of the method lies in initially generating a sequence of microstate transition patterns through state space compression of EEG data using microstate analysis. Following this, we assess the non-randomness of these microstate patterns using information-based similarity analysis. The results suggest that this MSNRI metric is a potential marker for distinguishing between health control (HC) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (HC vs. FTD: 6.958 vs. 5.756, ",2024,dementia; electroencephalogram; information-based similarity; microstate transitions; non-randomness,,"Wan, W; Gu, Z; Peng, CK; Cui, X"

Investigating the brain's neurochemical profile at midlife in relation to dementia risk factors.,"Changes in the brain's physiology in Alzheimer's disease are thought to occur early in the disease's trajectory. In this study our aim was to investigate the brain's neurochemical profile in a midlife cohort in relation to risk factors for future dementia using single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Participants in the multi-site PREVENT-Dementia study (age range 40-59 year old) underwent 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy with the spectroscopy voxel placed in the posterior cingulate/precuneus region. Using LCModel, we quantified the absolute concentrations of myo-inositol, total N-acetylaspartate, total creatine, choline, glutathione and glutamate-glutamine for 406 participants (mean age 51.1; 65.3% female). Underlying partial volume effects were accounted for by applying a correction for the presence of cerebrospinal fluid in the magnetic resonance spectroscopy voxel. We investigated how metabolite concentrations related to apolipoprotein ɛ4 genotype, dementia family history, a risk score (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Incidence of Dementia -CAIDE) for future dementia including non-modifiable and potentially-modifiable factors and dietary patterns (adherence to Mediterranean diet). Dementia family history was associated with decreased total N-acetylaspartate and no differences were found between apolipoprotein ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers. A higher Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia score related to higher myo-inositol, choline, total creatine and glutamate-glutamine, an effect which was mainly driven by older age and a higher body mass index. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with lower choline, myo-inositol and total creatine; these effects did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. The observed associations suggest that at midlife the brain demonstrates subtle neurochemical changes in relation to both inherited and potentially modifiable risk factors for future dementia.",2024,APOE4; Alzheimer’s disease; MRS; brain metabolism; preclinical dementia,,"Dounavi, ME; McKiernan, E; Langsen, M; Gregory, S; Muniz-Terrera, G; Prats-Sedano, MA; Mada, MO; Williams, GB; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Mackay, C; Koychev, I; Malhotra, P; Ritchie, K; Ritchie, CW; Su, L; Waldman, AD; O' Brien, JT"
How Irregular Geometry and Complex Feed Waveform Affect Pulsating Arterial Mass Transfer.,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative condition that has various levels of effect on one's memory. It is thought to be caused by a buildup of protein in small fluid-filled spaces in the brain called perivascular spaces (PVS). The PVS often takes on the form of an annular region around arteries and is used as a protein-clearing system for the brain. To analyze the modes of mass transfer in the PVS, a digitized scan of a mouse brain PVS segment was meshed and used for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies. Tandem analyses were then carried out and compared between the mouse PVS section and a cylinder with commensurate dimensionless parameters and hydraulic resistance. The geometry pair was used to first validate the CFD model and then assess mass transfer in various advection states: no flow, constant flow, sinusoidal flow, sinusoidal flow with zero net solvent flux, and an anatomically correct asymmetrical periodic flow. Two mass transfer situations were considered, one being a protein build-up and the other being a protein blend-down. The results showed that, for all the flows in question and both protein scenarios, there was nearly no protein clearance benefit by the anatomically correct PVS geometry. Surprisingly, solute blend-down was diffusion-dominated even for high Peclet numbers. Findings herein lead to the conclusion that minimal risk would be incurred by incorporating PVS geometry into existing reduce-order modeling arterial networks.",2024,,,"Strasser, W"

Pseudostellaria heterophylla polysaccharide mitigates Alzheimer's-like pathology via regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in 5 × FAD mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by neuroinflammation, for which gut dysbiosis may be implicated. Our previous study showed that treatment with Pseudostellaria heterophylla aqueous extract and one of its cyclopeptides, heterophyllin B, attenuate memory deficits via immunomodulation and neurite regeneration. However, whether Pseudostellaria heterophylla polysaccharide (PH-PS) exerts neuroprotective effects against AD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The infrared spectrum, molecular weight, and carbohydrate composition of the PH-PS were determined. The results showed that PH-PS (Mw 8.771 kDa) was composed of glucose (57.78 %), galactose (41.52 %), and arabinose (0.70 %). PH-PS treatment ameliorated learning and spatial memory deficits, reduced amyloid β build-up, and suppressed reactive glia and astrocytes in 5 × FAD mice. 16S rRNA sequencing further showed that PH-PS remodelled the intestinal flora composition by promoting probiotic microbiota, such as Lactobacillus, Muribaculum, Monoglobus, and [Eubacterium]_siraeum_group, and suppressing inflammation-related UCG-009 and Blautia. Additionally, PH-PS restored intestinal barrier function; ameliorated peripheral inflammation by reducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, thereby converting M1 microglia and A1 astrocyte toward beneficial M2 and A2 phenotypes; and contributed to Aβ plaques clearance by upregulation of insulin degradation enzyme and neprilysin. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PH-PS may prevent the progression of AD via modulation of the gut microbiota and regulation of glial polarisation, which could provide evidence to design a potential diet therapy for preventing or curing AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive impairment; Microbiota-gut-brain axis; Pseudostellaria heterophylla polysaccharide,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Polysaccharides; Mice; Brain; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Models, Animal; Juglandaceae; Male; Neuroprotective Agents","He, C; Jiang, J; Liu, J; Zhou, L; Ge, Y; Yang, Z"

Modern scores for traditional tests - Review of the diagnostic potential of scores derived from word list learning tests in mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's Disease.,"Episodic memory impairment is one of the early hallmarks in Alzheimer's Disease. In the clinical diagnosis and research, episodic memory impairment is typically assessed using word lists that are repeatedly presented to and recalled by the participant across several trials. Until recently, total learning scores, which consist of the total number of words that are recalled by participants, were almost exclusively used for diagnostic purposes. The present review aims at summarizing evidence on additional scores derived from the learning trials which have recently been investigated more frequently regarding their diagnostic potential. These scores reflect item acquisition, error frequencies, strategy use, intertrial fluctuations, and recall consistency. Evidence was summarized regarding the effects of clinical status on these scores. Preclinical, mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's Disease stages were associated with a pattern of reduced item acquisition, more errors, less strategy use, and reduced access of items, indicating slowed and erroneous encoding. Practical implications and limitations of the present research will be discussed.",2024,Early Alzheimer's disease; Episodic memory; Mild cognitive impairment; Word list learning,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Memory and Learning Tests","Schäfer, S; Tröger, J; Kray, J"
Harmonizing three-dimensional MRI using pseudo-warping field guided GAN.,"In pursuit of cultivating automated models for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to aid in diagnostics, an escalating demand for extensive, multisite, and heterogeneous brain imaging datasets has emerged. This potentially introduces biased outcomes when directly applied for subsequent analysis. Researchers have endeavored to address this issue by pursuing the harmonization of MRIs. However, most existing image-based harmonization methods for MRI are tailored for 2D slices, which may introduce inter-slice variations when they are combined into a 3D volume. In this study, we aim to resolve inconsistencies between slices by introducing a pseudo-warping field. This field is created randomly and utilized to transform a slice into an artificially warped subsequent slice. The objective of this pseudo-warping field is to ensure that generators can consistently harmonize adjacent slices to another domain, without being affected by the varying content present in different slices. Furthermore, we construct unsupervised spatial and recycle loss to enhance the spatial accuracy and slice-wise consistency across the 3D images. The results demonstrate that our model effectively mitigates inter-slice variations and successfully preserves the anatomical details of the images during the harmonization process. Compared to generative harmonization models that employ 3D operators, our model exhibits greater computational efficiency and flexibility.",2024,Brain MRI; GAN; Pseudo-warping field; Slice-wise 3D MRI harmonization,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Brain; Algorithms; Neuroimaging","Lin, J; Li, Z; Zeng, Y; Liu, X; Li, L; Jahanshad, N; Ge, X; Zhang, D; Lu, M; Liu, M"
Prediction of Alzheimer's disease stages based on ResNet-Self-attention architecture with Bayesian optimization and best features selection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative illness that impairs cognition, function, and behavior by causing irreversible damage to multiple brain areas, including the hippocampus. The suffering of the patients and their family members will be lessened with an early diagnosis of AD. The automatic diagnosis technique is widely required due to the shortage of medical experts and eases the burden of medical staff. The automatic artificial intelligence (AI)-based computerized method can help experts achieve better diagnosis accuracy and precision rates. This study proposes a new automated framework for AD stage prediction based on the ResNet-Self architecture and Fuzzy Entropy-controlled Path-Finding Algorithm (FEcPFA). A data augmentation technique has been utilized to resolve the dataset imbalance issue. In the next step, we proposed a new deep-learning model based on the self-attention module. A ResNet-50 architecture is modified and connected with a self-attention block for important information extraction. The hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO) and then utilized to train the model, which was subsequently employed for feature extraction. The self-attention extracted features were optimized using the proposed FEcPFA. The best features were selected using FEcPFA and passed to the machine learning classifiers for the final classification. The experimental process utilized a publicly available MRI dataset and achieved an improved accuracy of 99.9%. The results were compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, demonstrating the improvement of the proposed framework in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; MRI; convolutional neural network; deep learning; fuzzy entropy; optimization; self-attention,,"Yaqoob, N; Khan, MA; Masood, S; Albarakati, HM; Hamza, A; Alhayan, F; Jamel, L; Masood, A"
Distinct patterns of plaque and microglia glycosylation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Glycosylation is the most common form of post-translational modification in the brain. Aberrant glycosylation has been observed in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, including dysregulation of terminal sialic acid (SA) modifications. While alterations in sialylation have been identified in AD, the localization of SA modifications on cellular or aggregate-associated glycans is largely unknown because of limited spatial resolution of commonly utilized methods. The present study aims to overcome these limitations with novel combinations of histologic techniques to characterize the sialylation landscape of O- and N-linked glycans in autopsy-confirmed AD post-mortem brain tissue. Sialylated glycans facilitate important cellular functions including cell-to-cell interaction, cell migration, cell adhesion, immune regulation, and membrane excitability. Previous studies have not investigated both N- and O-linked sialylated glycans in neurodegeneration. In this study, the location and distribution of sialylated glycans were evaluated in three brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) from 10 AD cases using quantitative digital pathology techniques. Notably, we found significantly greater N-sialylation of the Aβ plaque microenvironment compared with O-sialylation. Plaque-associated microglia displayed the most intense N-sialylation proximal to plaque pathology. Further analyses revealed distinct differences in the levels of N- and O-sialylation between cored and diffuse Aβ plaque morphologies. Interestingly, phosphorylated tau pathology led to a slight increase in N-sialylation and no influence of O-sialylation in these AD brains. Confirming our previous observations in mice with novel histologic approach, these findings support microglia sialylation appears to have a relationship with AD protein aggregates while providing potential targets for therapeutic strategies.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; digital pathology; glycosylation; microglia; senile plaque; sialylation,,"Fastenau, C; Bunce, M; Keating, M; Wickline, J; Hopp, SC; Bieniek, KF"
The relationship between object-based spatial ability and virtual navigation performance.,"Spatial navigation is a multi-faceted behaviour drawing on many different aspects of cognition. Visuospatial abilities, such as mental rotation and visuospatial working memory, in particular, may be key factors. A range of tests have been developed to assess visuospatial processing and memory, but how such tests relate to navigation ability remains unclear. This understanding is important to advance tests of navigation for disease monitoring in various disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) where spatial impairment is an early symptom. Here, we report the use of an established mobile gaming app, Sea Hero Quest (SHQ), as a measure of navigation ability in a sample of young, predominantly female university students (N = 78; 20; female = 74.3%; mean age = 20.33 years). We used three separate tests of navigation embedded in SHQ: wayfinding, path integration and spatial memory in a radial arm maze. In the same participants, we also collected measures of mental rotation (Mental Rotation Test), visuospatial processing (Design Organization Test) and visuospatial working memory (Digital Corsi). We found few strong correlations across our measures. Being good at wayfinding in a virtual navigation test does not mean an individual will also be good at path integration, have a superior memory in a radial arm maze, or rate themself as having a strong sense of direction. However, we observed that participants who were good in the wayfinding task of SHQ tended to perform well on the three visuospatial tasks examined here, and to also use a landmark strategy in the radial maze task. These findings help clarify the associations between different abilities involved in spatial navigation.",2024,,"Humans; Female; Spatial Navigation; Male; Young Adult; Adult; Memory, Short-Term; Spatial Memory; Maze Learning; Space Perception; Adolescent; Mobile Applications","Garg, T; Velasco, PF; Patai, EZ; Malcolm, CP; Kovalets, V; Bohbot, VD; Coutrot, A; Hegarty, M; Hornberger, M; Spiers, HJ"
Vocal expression of emotions discriminates dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease.,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the two most common neurodegenerative dementias, both exhibit altered emotional processing. However, how vocal emotional expressions alter in and differ between DLB and AD remains uninvestigated. We collected voice data during story reading from 152 older adults comprising DLB, AD, and cognitively unimpaired (CU) groups and compared their emotional prosody in terms of valence and arousal dimensions. Compared with matched AD and CU participants, DLB patients showed reduced overall emotional expressiveness, as well as lower valence (more negative) and lower arousal (calmer), the extent of which was associated with cognitive impairment and insular atrophy. Classification models using vocal features discriminated DLB from AD and CU with an AUC of 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. Our findings may aid in discriminating DLB patients from AD and CU individuals, serving as a surrogate marker for clinical and neuropathological changes in DLB.",2024,Lewy body dementia; affective prosody; arousal; digital health; emotional processing; machine learning; valence,,"Kobayashi, M; Yamada, Y; Shinkawa, K; Nemoto, M; Ota, M; Nemoto, K; Arai, T"
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) expression in microglia reduces amyloid β deposition and neurodegeneration by increasing SYK signaling and endolysosomal trafficking.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many gene polymorphisms associated with an increased risk of developing Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD). Many of these LOAD risk-associated alleles alter disease pathogenesis by influencing microglia innate immune responses and lipid metabolism. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), a GWAS LOAD risk-associated gene best known for its role in regulating systemic blood pressure, also enhances innate immunity and lipid processing in peripheral myeloid cells, but a role for ACE in modulating the function of myeloid-derived microglia remains unexplored. Using novel mice engineered to express ACE in microglia and CNS associated macrophages (CAMs), we find that ACE expression in microglia reduces Aβ plaque load, preserves vulnerable neurons and excitatory synapses, and greatly reduces learning and memory abnormalities in the 5xFAD amyloid mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). ACE-expressing microglia show enhanced Aβ phagocytosis and endolysosomal trafficking, increased clustering around amyloid plaques, and increased SYK tyrosine kinase activation downstream of the major Aβ receptors, TREM2 and CLEC7A. Single microglia sequencing and digital spatial profiling identifies downstream SYK signaling modules that are expressed by ACE expression in microglia that mediate endolysosomal biogenesis and trafficking, mTOR and PI3K/AKT signaling, and increased oxidative phosphorylation, while gene silencing or pharmacologic inhibition of SYK activity in ACE-expressing microglia abrogates the potentiated Aβ engulfment and endolysosomal trafficking. These findings establish a role for ACE in enhancing microglial immune function and they identify a potential use for ACE-expressing microglia as a cell-based therapy to augment endogenous microglial responses to Aβ in AD.",2024,,,"Gomez, AR; Byun, HR; Wu, S; Muhammad, AG; Ikbariyeh, J; Chen, J; Muro, A; Li, L; Bernstein, KE; Ainsworth, R; Tourtellotte, WG"
APOE4 homozygozity represents a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's disease.,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of APOE4 homozygosity on Alzheimer's disease (AD) by examining its clinical, pathological and biomarker changes to see whether APOE4 homozygotes constitute a distinct, genetically determined form of AD. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and five large cohorts with AD biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis included 3,297 individuals for the pathological study and 10,039 for the clinical study. Findings revealed that almost all APOE4 homozygotes exhibited AD pathology and had significantly higher levels of AD biomarkers from age 55 compared to APOE3 homozygotes. By age 65, nearly all had abnormal amyloid levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and 75% had positive amyloid scans, with the prevalence of these markers increasing with age, indicating near-full penetrance of AD biology in APOE4 homozygotes. The age of symptom onset was earlier in APOE4 homozygotes at 65.1, with a narrower 95% prediction interval than APOE3 homozygotes. The predictability of symptom onset and the sequence of biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes mirrored those in autosomal dominant AD and Down syndrome. However, in the dementia stage, there were no differences in amyloid or tau positron emission tomography across haplotypes, despite earlier clinical and biomarker changes. The study concludes that APOE4 homozygotes represent a genetic form of AD, suggesting the need for individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials and treatments.",2024,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Age of Onset; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E3; Apolipoprotein E4; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Homozygote; Positron-Emission Tomography; tau Proteins","Fortea, J; Pegueroles, J; Alcolea, D; Belbin, O; Dols-Icardo, O; Vaqué-Alcázar, L; Videla, L; Gispert, JD; Suárez-Calvet, M; Johnson, SC; Sperling, R; Bejanin, A; Lleó, A; Montal, V"

Progression subtypes in Parkinson's disease identified by a data-driven multi cohort analysis.,"The progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous across patients, affecting counseling and inflating the number of patients needed to test potential neuroprotective treatments. Moreover, disease subtypes might require different therapies. This work uses a data-driven approach to investigate how observed heterogeneity in PD can be explained by the existence of distinct PD progression subtypes. To derive stable PD progression subtypes in an unbiased manner, we analyzed multimodal longitudinal data from three large PD cohorts and performed extensive cross-cohort validation. A latent time joint mixed-effects model (LTJMM) was used to align patients on a common disease timescale. Progression subtypes were identified by variational deep embedding with recurrence (VaDER). In each cohort, we identified a fast-progressing and a slow-progressing subtype, reflected by different patterns of motor and non-motor symptoms progression, survival rates, treatment response, features extracted from DaTSCAN imaging and digital gait assessments, education, and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Progression subtypes could be predicted with ROC-AUC up to 0.79 for individual patients when a one-year observation period was used for model training. Simulations demonstrated that enriching clinical trials with fast-progressing patients based on these predictions can reduce the required cohort size by 43%. Our results show that heterogeneity in PD can be explained by two distinct subtypes of PD progression that are stable across cohorts. These subtypes align with the brain-first vs. body-first concept, which potentially provides a biological explanation for subtype differences. Our predictive models will enable clinical trials with significantly lower sample sizes by enriching fast-progressing patients.",2024,,,"Hähnel, T; Raschka, T; Sapienza, S; Klucken, J; Glaab, E; Corvol, JC; Falkenburger, BH; Fröhlich, H"

Clinical characteristics and removal approaches of tracheal and bronchial foreign bodies in elders.,"The symptoms of tracheobronchial foreign body in the elderly are not typical, so they are often missed or misdiagnosed. This study aims to depict the clinical characteristics of tracheobronchial foreign body inhalation in the elderly. We retrospectively analysed the clinical data of elder patients (age ≥ 65 years) diagnosed with tracheal and bronchial foreign bodies. The data included age, sex, clinical symptoms, type and location of foreign bodies, prehospital duration, Chest CT, bronchoscopic findings, and frequencies and tools for removing these elderly patients' tracheal and bronchial foreign bodies. All patients were followed up for a half year. Fifty-nine cases were included, of which only 32.2% had a definite aspiration history. Disease duration > 30 days accounted for 27.1% of the patients. 27.1% of the patients had a history of stroke, and 23.8% had Alzheimer's Disease. Regarding clinical symptoms, patients mainly experience cough and expectoration. The most common CT findings were abnormal density shadow (37.3%) and pulmonary infiltration (22.0%). Under bronchoscopy, purulent secretions were observed in 52.5% of patients, and granulation tissue hyperplasia was observed in 45.8%. Food (55.9%) was the most common foreign object, including seafood shells (5.1%), bones (20.3%), dentures (18.6%), and tablets (20.3%). The success rate of foreign body removal under a bronchoscope was 96.7%, 28.8% of the foreign bodies were on the left and 69.5% on the right. 5.1% of the elderly patients required rigid bronchoscopy, and 6.8% required two bronchoscopies. In elderly cohorts, tracheal foreign bodies are obscured by nonspecific clinical presentations and a paucity of aspiration history, challenging timely diagnosis.

Human olfactory neurosphere-derived cells: A unified tool for neurological disease modelling and neurotherapeutic applications.,"As one of the leading causes of global mortality and morbidity, various neurological diseases cause social and economic burdens. Despite significant advances in the treatment of neurological diseases, establishing a proper disease model, especially for degenerative and infectious diseases, remains a major challenging issue. For long, mice were the model of choice but suffered from serious drawbacks of differences in anatomical and functional aspects of the nervous system. Furthermore, the collection of post-mortem brain tissues limits their usage in cultured cell lines. Overcoming such limitations has prompted the usage of stem cells derived from the peripheral nervous system, such as the cells of the olfactory mucosa as a preferred choice. These cells can be easily cultured in vitro and retain the receptors of neuronal cells life-long. Such cells have various advantages over embryonic or induced stem cells, including homology, and ease of culture and can be conveniently obtained from diseased individuals through either biopsies or exfoliation. They have continuously helped in understanding the genetic and developmental mechanisms of degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

Digital quantification of the MMSE interlocking pentagon areas: a three-stage algorithm.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a widely employed screening tool for the severity of cognitive impairment. Among the MMSE items, the pentagon copying test (PCT) requires participants to accurately replicate a sample of two interlocking pentagons. While the PCT is traditionally scored on a binary scale, there have been limited developments of granular scoring scale to assess task performance. In this paper, we present a novel three-stage algorithm, called Quantification of Interlocking Pentagons (QIP) which quantifies PCT performance by computing the areas of individual pentagons and their intersection areas, and a balance ratio between the areas of the two individual pentagons. The three stages of the QIP algorithm include: (1) detection of line segments, (2) unraveling of the interlocking pentagons, and (3) quantification of areas. A set of 497 PCTs from 84 participants including their baseline and follow-up PCTs from the Rush Memory and Aging Project was selected blinded about their cognitive and clinical status. Analysis of the quantified data revealed a significant inverse relationship between age and balance ratio (beta = - 0.49, p = 0.0033), indicating that older age was associated with a smaller balance ratio. In addition, balance ratio was associated with perceptual speed (r = 0.71, p = 0.0135), vascular risk factors (beta = - 3.96, p = 0.0269), and medical conditions (beta = - 2.78, p = 0.0389). The QIP algorithm can serve as a useful tool for enhancing the scoring of performance in the PCT.",2024,Aging; Mini-mental state examination; Pentagon copying test; Perceptual speed,Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Kim, N; Truty, T; Duke Han, S; Heo, M; Buchman, AS; Bennett, DA; Tasaki, S"

Unveiling New Strategies Facilitating the Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging for the Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a global impact. The past few decades have witnessed significant strides in comprehending the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and developing diagnostic methodologies for AD, such as neuroimaging approaches. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have revolutionized the field by providing valuable insights into the structural and functional alterations in the brains of individuals with AD. These imaging modalities enable the detection of early biomarkers such as amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles, facilitating early and precise diagnosis. Furthermore, the emerging technologies encompassing blood-based biomarkers and neurochemical profiling exhibit promising results in the identification of specific molecular signatures for AD. The integration of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence has enhanced the predictive capacity of these diagnostic tools when analyzing complex datasets. In this review article, we will highlight not only some of the most used diagnostic imaging approaches in neurodegeneration research but focus much more on new tools like artificial intelligence, emphasizing their application in the realm of AD.

Development of a smartphone screening test for preclinical Alzheimer's disease and validation across the dementia continuum.,"Dementia prevalence is predicted to triple to 152 million globally by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes 70% of cases. There is an urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD, a 10-20-year period of progressive brain pathology without noticeable cognitive symptoms, for targeted risk reduction. Current tests of AD pathology are either too invasive, specialised or expensive for population-level assessments. Cognitive tests are normal in preclinical AD. Emerging evidence demonstrates that movement analysis is sensitive to AD across the disease continuum, including preclinical AD. Our new smartphone test, TapTalk, combines analysis of hand and speech-like movements to detect AD risk. This study aims to [1] determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately predict preclinical AD [2], determine usability, reliability, and validity of TapTalk in cognitively asymptomatic older adults and [3], prospectively validate TapTalk in older adults who have cognitive symptoms against cognitive tests and clinical diagnoses of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Dementia; Diadochokinesis; Digital biomarker; Finger-tapping; Kinematics; Multimodal; TAS Test; TapTalk,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Smartphone; Prospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Alty, J; Goldberg, LR; Roccati, E; Lawler, K; Bai, Q; Huang, G; Bindoff, AD; Li, R; Wang, X; St George, RJ; Rudd, K; Bartlett, L; Collins, JM; Aiyede, M; Fernando, N; Bhagwat, A; Giffard, J; Salmon, K; McDonald, S; King, AE; Vickers, JC"

Disease and brain region specific immune response profiles in neurodegenerative diseases with pure and mixed protein pathologies.,"The disease-specific accumulation of pathological proteins has long been the major focus of research in neurodegenerative diseases (ND), including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (RD), but the recent identification of a multitude of genetic risk factors for ND in immune-associated genes highlights the importance of immune processes in disease pathogenesis and progression. Studies in animal models have characterized the local immune response to disease-specific proteins in AD and ADRD, but due to the complexity of disease processes and the co-existence of multiple protein pathologies in human donor brains, the precise role of immune processes in ND is far from understood. To better characterize the interplay between different extracellular and intracellular protein pathologies and the brain's intrinsic immune system in ND, we set out to comprehensively profile the local immune response in postmortem brain samples of individuals with ""pure"" beta-Amyloid and tau pathology (AD), ""pure"" α-Synuclein pathology in Lewy body diseases (LBD), as well as cases with Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes (ADNC) and Lewy body pathology (MIX). Combining immunohistochemical profiling of microglia and digital image analysis, along with deep immunophenotyping using gene expression profiling on the NanoString nCounter® platform and digital spatial profiling on the NanoString GeoMx® platform we identified a robust immune activation signature in AD brain samples. This signature is maintained in persons with mixed pathologies, irrespective of co-existence of AD pathology and Lewy body (LB) pathology, while LBD brain samples with ""pure"" LB pathology exhibit an attenuated and distinct immune signature.

Light on Alzheimer's disease: from basic insights to preclinical studies.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), referring to a gradual deterioration in cognitive function, including memory loss and impaired thinking skills, has emerged as a substantial worldwide challenge with profound social and economic implications. As the prevalence of AD continues to rise and the population ages, there is an imperative demand for innovative imaging techniques to help improve our understanding of these complex conditions. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging forms a hybrid imaging modality by integrating the high-contrast of optical imaging and deep-penetration of ultrasound imaging. PA imaging enables the visualization and characterization of tissue structures and multifunctional information at high resolution and, has demonstrated promising preliminary results in the study and diagnosis of AD. This review endeavors to offer a thorough overview of the current applications and potential of PA imaging on AD diagnosis and treatment. Firstly, the structural, functional, molecular parameter changes associated with AD-related brain imaging captured by PA imaging will be summarized, shaping the diagnostic standpoint of this review. Then, the therapeutic methods aimed at AD is discussed further. Lastly, the potential solutions and clinical applications to expand the extent of PA imaging into deeper AD scenarios is proposed. While certain aspects might not be fully covered, this mini-review provides valuable insights into AD diagnosis and treatment through the utilization of innovative tissue photothermal effects. We hope that it will spark further exploration in this field, fostering improved and earlier theranostics for AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; brain imaging; diagnose and theranostics; imaging modalities; photoacoustic imaging,,"Mi, J; Liu, C; Chen, H; Qian, Y; Zhu, J; Zhang, Y; Liang, Y; Wang, L; Ta, D"
Enhanced Multiscale Human Brain Imaging by Semi-supervised Digital Staining and Serial Sectioning Optical Coherence Tomography.,"A major challenge in neuroscience is to visualize the structure of the human brain at different scales. Traditional histology reveals micro- and meso-scale brain features, but suffers from staining variability, tissue damage and distortion that impedes accurate 3D reconstructions. Here, we present a new 3D imaging framework that combines serial sectioning optical coherence tomography (S-OCT) with a deep-learning digital staining (DS) model. We develop a novel semi-supervised learning technique to facilitate DS model training on weakly paired images. The DS model performs translation from S-OCT to Gallyas silver staining. We demonstrate DS on various human cerebral cortex samples with consistent staining quality. Additionally, we show that DS enhances contrast across cortical layer boundaries. Furthermore, we showcase geometry-preserving 3D DS on cubic-centimeter tissue blocks and visualization of meso-scale vessel networks in the white matter. We believe that our technique offers the potential for high-throughput, multiscale imaging of brain tissues and may facilitate studies of brain structures.",2024,,,"Cheng, S; Chang, S; Li, Y; Novoseltseva, A; Lin, S; Wu, Y; Zhu, J; McKee, AC; Rosene, DL; Wang, H; Bigio, IJ; Boas, DA; Tian, L"
Cognitive modeling of the Mnemonic Similarity Task as a digital biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease.,"AD related pathologies, such as beta-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are evident decades before any noticeable decline in memory occurs. Identifying individuals during this asymptomatic phase is crucial for timely intervention. The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST), a modified recognition memory task, is especially relevant for early AD screening, as it assesses hippocampal integrity, a region affected (both directly and indirectly) early in the progression of the disease. Further, strong inferences on the underlying cognitive mechanisms that support performance on this task can be made using Bayesian cognitive modeling. We assessed whether analyzing MST performance using a cognitive model could detect subtle changes in cognitive function and AD biomarker status prior to overt cognitive decline. We analyzed MST data from >200 individuals (young, cognitively healthy older adults, and individuals with MCI), a subset of which also had existing CSF Aβ and pTau data. Traditional performance scores and cognitive modeling using multinomial processing trees was applied to each participants MST data using Bayesian approaches. We assessed how well each could predict age group, memory ability, MCI status, Aβ/pTau status using ROC analyses. Both approaches predicted age group membership equally, but cognitive modeling approaches exceeded traditional metrics in all other comparisons.

Intelligent decision support systems for dementia care: A scoping review.,"In the context of dementia care, Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered clinical decision support systems have the potential to enhance diagnosis and management. However, the scope and challenges of applying these technologies remain unclear. This scoping review aims to investigate the current state of AI applications in the development of intelligent decision support systems for dementia care. We conducted a comprehensive scoping review of empirical studies that utilised AI-powered clinical decision support systems in dementia care. The results indicate that AI applications in dementia care primarily focus on diagnosis, with limited attention to other aspects outlined in the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017-2025 (GAPD). A trifecta of challenges, encompassing data availability, cost considerations, and AI algorithm performance, emerges as noteworthy barriers in adoption of AI applications in dementia care. To address these challenges and enhance AI reliability, we propose a novel approach: a digital twin-based patient journey model. Future research should address identified gaps in GAPD action areas, navigate data-related obstacles, and explore the implementation of digital twins. Additionally, it is imperative to emphasize that addressing trust and combating the stigma associated with AI in healthcare should be a central focus of future research directions.",2024,Alzheimer; Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Dementia,Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Reproducibility of Results; Algorithms; Dementia; Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases,"Andargoli, AE; Ulapane, N; Nguyen, TA; Shuakat, N; Zelcer, J; Wickramasinghe, N"

Evaluation of the relationship between FDG-PET hypometabolism and retinal layer thickness in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to assess the correlation between OCT and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) which shows high diagnostic agreement with findings from postmortem histopathology-the gold standard method. Patients who were diagnosed with AD-related dementia were selected for the study. Patients with a mini mental test (MMT) score between 18 and 23 were included in the study (n = 31). Volunteers with MMT ≥ 28 and no cognitive impairment were included in the study as the control group (n = 31). OCT imaging was performed in the patient and control groups after detailed ophthalmological examinations including visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements. Brain glucose metabolism measurement was performed using 18 F-FDG PET/computed tomography. When adjusted for age and sex, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) thickness showed a significant difference between groups and the RNFL thickness in the superior temporal and superior nasal quadrants in AD-related mild dementia group showed a significant difference (p < 0.05). Furthermore, only the RNFL thickness in the inferior nasal quadrant of the right eye showed a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.016). It is thought that OCT is a promising imaging method in the elderly population due to its low-cost, non-invasive and easily applicability, and therefore, it may contribute in the future as a tool in the periodic follow-up of patients diagnosed with AD.",2024,Cognitive functions; Dementia; Positron emission tomography; Retinal neurodegeneration,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Male; Aged; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Retina; Positron-Emission Tomography; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Radiopharmaceuticals; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography","Duman Sastim, D; Elboga, G; Elboga, U; Gungor, K"

A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"

Machine Learning and Digital Biomarkers Can Detect Early Stages of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are devastating conditions that can develop without noticeable symptoms, causing irreversible damage to neurons before any signs become clinically evident. NDs are a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Currently, there are no cures or treatments to halt their progression. Therefore, the development of early detection methods is urgently needed to delay neuronal loss as soon as possible. Despite advancements in Medtech, the early diagnosis of NDs remains a challenge at the intersection of medical, IT, and regulatory fields. Thus, this review explores ""digital biomarkers"" (tools designed for remote neurocognitive data collection and AI analysis) as a potential solution. The review summarizes that recent studies combining AI with digital biomarkers suggest the possibility of identifying pre-symptomatic indicators of NDs. For instance, research utilizing convolutional neural networks for eye tracking has achieved significant diagnostic accuracies. ROC-AUC scores reached up to 0.88, indicating high model performance in differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls. Similarly, advancements in facial expression analysis through tools have demonstrated significant potential in detecting emotional changes in ND patients, with some models reaching an accuracy of 0.89 and a precision of 0.85. This review follows a structured approach to article selection, starting with a comprehensive database search and culminating in a rigorous quality assessment and meaning for NDs of the different methods. The process is visualized in 10 tables with 54 parameters describing different approaches and their consequences for understanding various mechanisms in ND changes. However, these methods also face challenges related to data accuracy and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this review proposes strategies that emphasize the need for rigorous validation and rapid integration into clinical practice. Such integration could transform ND diagnostics, making early detection tools more cost-effective and globally accessible. In conclusion, this review underscores the urgent need to incorporate validated digital health tools into mainstream medical practice. This integration could indicate a new era in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially altering the trajectory of these conditions for millions worldwide. Thus, by highlighting specific and statistically significant findings, this review demonstrates the current progress in this field and the potential impact of these advancements on the global management of NDs.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; digital endpoints; digital phenotyping; early detection; eye-tracking; machine learning; neurodegenerative diseases; online cognitive testing,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Biomarkers; Machine Learning,"Chudzik, A; Śledzianowski, A; Przybyszewski, AW"
Impact of vaccination on the association of COVID-19 with cardiovascular diseases: An OpenSAFELY cohort study.,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events, but the implications of vaccination for this increased risk are uncertain. With the approval of NHS England, we quantified associations between COVID-19 diagnosis and cardiovascular diseases in different vaccination and variant eras using linked electronic health records for ~40% of the English population. We defined a 'pre-vaccination' cohort (18,210,937 people) in the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and 'vaccinated' and 'unvaccinated' cohorts (13,572,399 and 3,161,485 people respectively) in the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We showed that the incidence of each arterial thrombotic, venous thrombotic and other cardiovascular outcomes was substantially elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19, compared with before or without COVID-19, but less markedly elevated in time periods beyond week 4. Hazard ratios were higher after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19 and higher in the pre-vaccination and unvaccinated cohorts than the vaccinated cohort.

Blood-Based Biomarkers for Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis in Real-World Settings.,"As our knowledge about the biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) expands and we recognize the significance of early intervention for effective treatment, there is a shift in focus toward detecting the disease at an early stage. AD is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau proteins in the brain, leading to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While a definitive diagnosis of AD can only be confirmed through autopsy by examining these pathological features, there are now reliable methods available for diagnosing the disease in living individuals. These methods involve analyzing cerebrospinal fluid and using positron emission tomography to accurately assess the presence of Aβ and tau proteins. While these diagnostic markers have shown high accuracy in memory-clinic populations, they do have limitations such as the requirement for invasive lumbar puncture or exposure to ionizing radiation. Additionally, they are not easily accessible outside of specialized healthcare settings. Blood-based biomarkers of the core pathological features of AD are being developed, showing promise for less invasive, scalable identification of AD cases in the community. The advantages for the healthcare systems of this development are obvious, but the diagnostic performance of blood-based biomarkers in broader, non-selected populations outside of retrospective analyses and research cohorts still requires further investigation, including the combination with more effective neuropsychological assessments such as digital cognitive test solutions.",2024,Early and targeted treatment and prevention of neurodegeneration; Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; Patient and service user value; Scalable diagnostic technologies; Subjective cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Retrospective Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers,"Perneczky, R; Hansen, N; Hofmann, A; Laske, C; Priller, J; Grimmer, T; Frölich, L; Düzel, E; Jessen, F; Wiltfang, J"

Comparison of histological delineations of medial temporal lobe cortices by four independent neuroanatomy laboratories.,"The medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortex, located adjacent to the hippocampus, is crucial for memory and prone to the accumulation of certain neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease neurofibrillary tau tangles. The MTL cortex is composed of several subregions which differ in their functional and cytoarchitectonic features. As neuroanatomical schools rely on different cytoarchitectonic definitions of these subregions, it is unclear to what extent their delineations of MTL cortex subregions overlap. Here, we provide an overview of cytoarchitectonic definitions of the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices as well as Brodmann areas (BA) 35 and 36, as provided by four neuroanatomists from different laboratories, aiming to identify the rationale for overlapping and diverging delineations. Nissl-stained series were acquired from the temporal lobes of three human specimens (two right and one left hemisphere). Slices (50 μm thick) were prepared perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus spanning the entire longitudinal extent of the MTL cortex. Four neuroanatomists annotated MTL cortex subregions on digitized slices spaced 5 mm apart (pixel size 0.4 μm at 20× magnification). Parcellations, terminology, and border placement were compared among neuroanatomists. Cytoarchitectonic features of each subregion are described in detail. Qualitative analysis of the annotations showed higher agreement in the definitions of the entorhinal cortex and BA35, while the definitions of BA36 and the parahippocampal cortex exhibited less overlap among neuroanatomists. The degree of overlap of cytoarchitectonic definitions was partially reflected in the neuroanatomists' agreement on the respective delineations. Lower agreement in annotations was observed in transitional zones between structures where seminal cytoarchitectonic features are expressed less saliently. The results highlight that definitions and parcellations of the MTL cortex differ among neuroanatomical schools and thereby increase understanding of why these differences may arise. This work sets a crucial foundation to further advance anatomically-informed neuroimaging research on the human MTL cortex.",2024,Brodmann area 35; Brodmann area 36; entorhinal cortex; harmonization; neuroimaging; parahippocampal cortex; parahippocampal gyrus; segmentation,"Humans; Temporal Lobe; Neuroanatomy; Male; Parahippocampal Gyrus; Female; Aged; Entorhinal Cortex; Laboratories; Aged, 80 and over","Wuestefeld, A; Baumeister, H; Adams, JN; de Flores, R; Hodgetts, CJ; Mazloum-Farzaghi, N; Olsen, RK; Puliyadi, V; Tran, TT; Bakker, A; Canada, KL; Dalton, MA; Daugherty, AM; La Joie, R; Wang, L; Bedard, ML; Buendia, E; Chung, E; Denning, A; Del Mar Arroyo-Jiménez, M; Artacho-Pérula, E; Irwin, DJ; Ittyerah, R; Lee, EB; Lim, S; Del Pilar Marcos-Rabal, M; Iñiguez de Onzoño Martin, MM; Lopez, MM; de la Rosa Prieto, C; Schuck, T; Trotman, W; Vela, A; Yushkevich, P; Amunts, K; Augustinack, JC; Ding, SL; Insausti, R; Kedo, O; Berron, D; Wisse, LEM"

Low-frequency rTMS modulated the excitability and high-frequency firing in hippocampal neurons of the Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, holds potential for applications in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to compare the therapeutic effects of rTMS at different frequencies on Alzheimer's disease and explore the alterations in neuronal electrophysiological properties throughout this process. APP/PS1 AD mice were subjected to two rTMS treatments at 0.5 Hz and 20 Hz, followed by assessments of therapeutic outcomes through the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests. Following this, whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used to record action potential, voltage-gated sodium channel currents, and voltage-gated potassium channel currents in dentate gyrus granule neurons. The results show that AD mice exhibit significant cognitive decline compared to normal mice, along with a pronounced reduction in neuronal excitability and ion channel activity. Both frequencies of rTMS treatment partially reversed these changes, demonstrating similar therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the investigation indicates that low-frequency magnetic stimulation inhibited the concentrated firing of early action potentials in AD.",2024,Action potential; Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive function; Potassium channels; Sodium channels; rTMS,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Neurons; Hippocampus; Action Potentials; Disease Models, Animal","Zhang, Z; Ding, C; Fu, R; Wang, J; Zhao, J; Zhu, H"

Virtual Reality and Serious Videogame-Based Instruments for Assessing Spatial Navigation in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review of Psychometric Properties.,"Over the past decade, research using virtual reality and serious game-based instruments for assessing spatial navigation and spatial memory in at-risk and AD populations has risen. We systematically reviewed the literature since 2012 to identify and evaluate the methodological quality and risk of bias in the analyses of the psychometric properties of VRSG-based instruments. The search was conducted primarily in July-December 2022 and updated in November 2023 in eight major databases. The quality of instrument development and study design were analyzed in all studies. Measurement properties were defined and analyzed according to COSMIN guidelines. A total of 1078 unique records were screened, and following selection criteria, thirty-seven studies were analyzed. From these studies, 30 instruments were identified. Construct and criterion validity were the most reported measurement properties, while structural validity and internal consistency evidence were the least reported. Nineteen studies were deemed very good in construct validity, whereas 11 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy were deemed very good in quality. Limitations regarding theoretical framework and research design requirements were found in most of the studies. VRSG-based instruments are valuable additions to the current diagnostic toolkit for AD. Further research is required to establish the psychometric performance and clinical utility of VRSG-based instruments, particularly the instrument development, content validity, and diagnostic accuracy for preclinical AD screening scenarios.

Non-invasive modulation of meningeal lymphatics ameliorates ageing and Alzheimer's disease-associated pathology and cognition in mice.,"Meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) have been shown to be involved in amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance, which is considered as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, based on the superficial spatial distribution of mLVs, a near-infrared light is employed to modulate lymphatic drainage, significantly improving cognition of both aged and AD (5xFAD and APP/PS1) mice, and alleviating AD-associated pathology by reducing Aβ deposition, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy imaging and RNA sequencing data indicate amelioration of mitochondrial metabolism and cellular junction of meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells (mLECs) by light modulation. These studies collectively suggest that near-infrared light treatment can improve cognitive function by strengthening scavenging ability of mLVs through restoring mLEC function. In conclusion, lymphatic drainage potentiation by light promotes pathological remission and cognitive enhancement in aging and AD mouse models, which offers a potential amelioration strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.",2024,,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mice, Transgenic; Endothelial Cells; Cognition; Aging; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","Wang, M; Yan, C; Li, X; Yang, T; Wu, S; Liu, Q; Luo, Q; Zhou, F"

A screening method for mild cognitive impairment in elderly individuals combining bioimpedance and MMSE.,"We investigated a screening method for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that combined bioimpedance features and the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) score. Data were collected from 539 subjects aged 60 years or older at the Gwangju Alzheimer's & Related Dementias (GARD) Cohort Research Center, A total of 470 participants were used for the analysis, including 318 normal controls and 152 MCI participants. We measured bioimpedance, K-MMSE, and the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB-II). We developed a multiple linear regression model to predict MCI by combining bioimpedance variables and K-MMSE total score and compared the model's accuracy with SNSB-II domain scores by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We additionally compared the model performance with several machine learning models such as extreme gradient boosting, random forest, support vector machine, and elastic net. To test the model performances, the dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). The AUROC values of SNSB-II scores were 0.803 in both sexes, 0.840 for males, and 0.770 for females. In the combined model, the AUROC values were 0.790 (0.773) for males (and females), which were significantly higher than those from the model including MMSE scores alone (0.723 for males and 0.622 for females) or bioimpedance variables alone (0.640 for males and 0.615 for females). Furthermore, the accuracies of the combined model were comparable to those of machine learning models. The bioimpedance-MMSE combined model effectively distinguished the MCI participants and suggests a technique for rapid and improved screening of the elderly population at risk of cognitive impairment.",2024,bioimpedance analysis; combination of bioimpedance and MMSE; dementia; mild cognitive impairment; screening,,"Jun, MH; Ku, B; Kim, K; Lee, KH; Kim, JU"

Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories: Innovating aging research and Alzheimer's care.,"This perspective outlines the Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories (AITC) at Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Massachusetts, highlighting their roles in developing AI-based technologies for older adult care, particularly targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD). These National Institute on Aging (NIA) centers foster collaboration among clinicians, gerontologists, ethicists, business professionals, and engineers to create AI solutions. Key activities include identifying technology needs, stakeholder engagement, training, mentoring, data integration, and navigating ethical challenges. The objective is to apply these innovations effectively in real-world scenarios, including in rural settings. In addition, the AITC focuses on developing best practices for AI application in the care of older adults, facilitating pilot studies, and addressing ethical concerns related to technology development for older adults with cognitive impairment, with the ultimate aim of improving the lives of older adults and their caregivers. HIGHLIGHTS: Addressing the complex needs of older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a comprehensive approach, integrating medical and social support. Current gaps in training, techniques, tools, and expertise hinder uniform access across communities and health care settings. Artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies hold promise in transforming care for this demographic. Yet, transitioning these innovations from concept to marketable products presents significant challenges, often stalling promising advancements in the developmental phase. The Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories (AITC) program, funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), presents a viable model. These Collaboratories foster the development and implementation of AI methods and technologies through projects aimed at improving care for older Americans, particularly those with AD, and promote the sharing of best practices in AI and technology integration. Why Does This Matter? The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories (AITC) program's mission is to accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and new technologies for the betterment of older adults, especially those with dementia. By bridging scientific and technological expertise, fostering clinical and industry partnerships, and enhancing the sharing of best practices, this program can significantly improve the health and quality of life for older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD).",2024,Alzheimer's disease; artificial intelligence; healthy aging; machine learning; older adults; pilot studies; technology,United States; Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Geroscience; Quality of Life; Technology; Isothiocyanates,"Abadir, P; Oh, E; Chellappa, R; Choudhry, N; Demiris, G; Ganesan, D; Karlawish, J; Marlin, B; Li, RM; Dehak, N; Arbaje, A; Unberath, M; Cudjoe, T; Chute, C; Moore, JH; Phan, P; Samus, Q; Schoenborn, NL; Battle, A; Walston, JD"

An Introduction to Smart Home Ward-Based Hospital-at-Home Care in China.,"Hospital-at-home has been gaining increased attention as a potential remedy for the current shortcomings of our health care system, allowing for essential health services to be provided to patients in the comfort of their own homes. The advent of digital technology has revolutionized the way we provide medical and health care, leading to the emergence of a “hospital without walls.” The rapid adoption of novel digital health care technologies is revolutionizing remote health care provision, effectively dismantling the conventional boundary separating hospitals from the comfort of patients’ homes. The Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital has developed a 5G-powered Smart Home Ward (SHW) that extends medical care services to the home setting and is tailored to meet the needs and settings of each patient’s household. The SHW was initially tested for its suitability for treating 4 specialized diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease. Understanding and addressing the potential challenges and risks associated with SHWs is essential for the successful implementation and maintenance of safe and effective home hospitalization.",2024,health care; healthcare delivery; home care; hospital at home; implementation; medical care; medical monitoring; rehabilitation; smart home ward; smart ward; telemedicine; telemonitoring,Humans; Telemedicine; Hospitals; Home Care Services; China,"Cheng, W; Cao, X; Lian, W; Tian, J"

DeepResBat: deep residual batch harmonization accounting for covariate distribution differences.,"Pooling MRI data from multiple datasets requires harmonization to reduce undesired inter-site variabilities, while preserving effects of biological variables (or covariates). The popular harmonization approach ComBat uses a mixed effect regression framework that explicitly accounts for covariate distribution differences across datasets. There is also significant interest in developing harmonization approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs), such as conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE). However, current DNN approaches do not explicitly account for covariate distribution differences across datasets. Here, we provide mathematical results, suggesting that not accounting for covariates can lead to suboptimal harmonization outcomes. We propose two DNN-based harmonization approaches that explicitly account for covariate distribution differences across datasets: covariate VAE (coVAE) and DeepResBat. The coVAE approach is a natural extension of cVAE by concatenating covariates and site information with site- and covariate-invariant latent representations. DeepResBat adopts a residual framework inspired by ComBat. DeepResBat first removes the effects of covariates with nonlinear regression trees, followed by eliminating site differences with cVAE. Finally, covariate effects are added back to the harmonized residuals. Using three datasets from three different continents with a total of 2787 participants and 10085 anatomical T1 scans, we find that DeepResBat and coVAE outperformed ComBat, CovBat and cVAE in terms of removing dataset differences, while enhancing biological effects of interest. However, coVAE hallucinates spurious associations between anatomical MRI and covariates even when no association exists. Therefore, future studies proposing DNN-based harmonization approaches should be aware of this false positive pitfall. Overall, our results suggest that DeepResBat is an effective deep learning alternative to ComBat.",2024,,,"An, L; Zhang, C; Wulan, N; Zhang, S; Chen, P; Ji, F; Ng, KK; Chen, C; Zhou, JH; Thomas Yeo, BT"
Multi-trait analysis characterizes the genetics of thyroid function and identifies causal associations with clinical implications.,"To date only a fraction of the genetic footprint of thyroid function has been clarified. We report a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of thyroid function in up to 271,040 individuals of European ancestry, including reference range thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free and total triiodothyronine (T3), proxies for metabolism (T3/FT4 ratio) as well as dichotomized high and low TSH levels. We revealed 259 independent significant associations for TSH (61% novel), 85 for FT4 (67% novel), and 62 novel signals for the T3 related traits. The loci explained 14.1%, 6.0%, 9.5% and 1.1% of the total variation in TSH, FT4, total T3 and free T3 concentrations, respectively.

Naturalistic assessment of reaction time variability in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Maintaining attention underlies many aspects of cognition and becomes compromised early in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The consistency of maintaining attention can be measured with reaction time (RT) variability. Previous work has focused on measuring such fluctuations during in-clinic testing, but recent developments in remote, smartphone-based cognitive assessments can allow one to test if these fluctuations in attention are evident in naturalistic settings and if they are sensitive to traditional clinical and cognitive markers of AD.",2024,apolipoprotein e4; attention consistency; digital biomarkers; mobile testing; preclinical alzheimer disease,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Aged; Male; Female; Reaction Time; Aged, 80 and over; Neuropsychological Tests; Apolipoprotein E4; Smartphone; Attention","Welhaf, MS; Wilks, H; Aschenbrenner, AJ; Balota, DA; Schindler, SE; Benzinger, TLS; Gordon, BA; Cruchaga, C; Xiong, C; Morris, JC; Hassenstab, J"
Estimating dementia risk in an African American population using the DCTclock.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is increasing. African Americans are twice as likely to develop dementia than other ethnic populations. Traditional cognitive screening solutions lack the sensitivity to independently identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline. The DCTclock is a 3-min AI-enabled adaptation of the well-established clock drawing test. The DCTclock can estimate dementia risk for both general cognitive impairment and the presence of AD pathology. Here we performed a retrospective analysis to assess the performance of the DCTclock to estimate future conversion to ADRD in African American participants from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and African American Clinical Core (AACORE). We assessed baseline DCTclock scores in 646 participants (baseline median age = 78.0 ± 6.4, median years of education = 14.0 ± 3.2, 78% female) and found significantly lower baseline DCTclock scores in those who received a dementia diagnosis within 3 years. We also found that 16.4% of participants with a baseline DCTclock score less than 60 were significantly more likely to develop dementia in 5 years vs. those with the highest DCTclock scores (75-100). This research demonstrates the DCTclock's ability to estimate the 5-year risk of developing dementia in an African American population. Early detection of elevated dementia risk using the DCTclock could provide patients, caregivers, and clinicians opportunities to plan and intervene early to improve cognitive health trajectories. Early detection of dementia risk can also enhance participant selection in clinical trials while reducing screening costs.",2023,African American clinical; Alzheimer’s disease; DCTclock; Minority Aging Research Study (MARS); Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center; dementia; dementia estimation,,"Ciesla, M; Pobst, J; Gomes-Osman, J; Lamar, M; Barnes, LL; Banks, R; Jannati, A; Libon, D; Swenson, R; Tobyne, S; Bates, D; Showalter, J; Pascual-Leone, A"

Digging into the intrinsic capacity concept: Can it be applied to Alzheimer's disease?,"Historically, aging research has largely centered on disease pathology rather than promoting healthy aging. The World Health Organization's (WHO) policy framework (2015-2030) underscores the significance of fostering the contributions of older individuals to their families, communities, and economies. The WHO has introduced the concept of intrinsic capacity (IC) as a key metric for healthy aging, encompassing five primary domains: locomotion, vitality, sensory, cognitive, and psychological. Past AD research, constrained by methodological limitations, has focused on single outcome measures, sidelining the complexity of the disease. Our current scientific milieu, however, is primed to adopt the IC concept. This is due to three critical considerations: (I) the decline in IC is linked to neurocognitive disorders, including AD, (II) cognition, a key component of IC, is deeply affected in AD, and (III) the cognitive decline associated with AD involves multiple factors and pathophysiological pathways. Our study explores the application of the IC concept to AD patients, offering a comprehensive model that could revolutionize the disease's diagnosis and prognosis. There is a dearth of information on the biological characteristics of IC, which are a result of complex interactions within biological systems. Employing a systems biology approach, integrating omics technologies, could aid in unraveling these interactions and understanding IC from a holistic viewpoint. This comprehensive analysis of IC could be leveraged in clinical settings, equipping healthcare providers to assess AD patients' health status more effectively and devise personalized therapeutic interventions in accordance with the precision medicine paradigm. We aimed to determine whether the IC concept could be extended from older individuals to patients with AD, thereby presenting a model that could significantly enhance the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Digital biomarkers; Digital healthcare; Dimensions; Intrinsic capacity; Systems biology,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aging,"López-Ortiz, S; Caruso, G; Emanuele, E; Menéndez, H; Peñín-Grandes, S; Guerrera, CS; Caraci, F; Nisticò, R; Lucia, A; Santos-Lozano, A; Lista, S"

Digital Therapeutics for Improving Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Drugs and Biological Products: Preclinical and Clinical Studies Supporting Development of Drug + Digital Combination Therapies for Chronic Diseases.,"Limitations of pharmaceutical drugs and biologics for chronic diseases (e.g., medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, or inadequate efficacy) can be mitigated by mobile medical apps, known as digital therapeutics (DTx). Authorization of adjunct DTx by the US Food and Drug Administration and draft guidelines on ""prescription drug use-related software"" illustrate opportunities to create drug + digital combination therapies, ultimately leading towards drug-device combination products (DTx has a status of medical devices). Digital interventions (mobile, web-based, virtual reality, and video game applications) demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for people living with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. In the respective animal disease models, preclinical studies on environmental enrichment and other non-pharmacological modalities (physical activity, social interactions, learning, and music) as surrogates for DTx ""active ingredients"" also show improved outcomes.

Enhancing foveal avascular zone analysis for Alzheimer's diagnosis with AI segmentation and machine learning using multiple radiomic features.,"We propose a hybrid technique that employs artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation and machine learning classification using multiple features extracted from the foveal avascular zone (FAZ)-a retinal biomarker for Alzheimer's disease-to improve the disease diagnostic performance. Imaging data of optical coherence tomography angiography from 37 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 48 healthy controls were investigated. The presence or absence of brain amyloids was confirmed using amyloid positron emission tomography. In the superficial capillary plexus of the angiography scans, the FAZ was automatically segmented using an AI method to extract multiple biomarkers (area, solidity, compactness, roundness, and eccentricity), which were paired with clinical data (age and sex) as common correction variables. We used a light-gradient boosting machine (a light-gradient boosting machine is a machine learning algorithm based on trees utilizing gradient boosting) to diagnose Alzheimer's disease by integrating the corresponding multiple radiomic biomarkers. Fivefold cross-validation was applied for analysis, and the diagnostic performance for Alzheimer's disease was determined by the area under the curve. The proposed hybrid technique achieved an area under the curve of [Formula: see text]%, outperforming the existing single-feature (area) criteria by over 13%. Furthermore, in the holdout test set, the proposed technique exhibited a 14% improvement compared to single features, achieving an area under the curve of 72.0± 4.8%. Based on these facts, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our technology in achieving significant performance improvements in FAZ-based Alzheimer's diagnosis research through the use of multiple radiomic biomarkers (area, solidity, compactness, roundness, and eccentricity).",2024,,"Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Alzheimer Disease; Radiomics; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Machine Learning; Biomarkers","Yoon, JM; Lim, CY; Noh, H; Nam, SW; Jun, SY; Kim, MJ; Song, MY; Jang, H; Kim, HJ; Seo, SW; Na, DL; Chung, MJ; Ham, DI; Kim, K"
Intelligent digital tools for screening of brain connectivity and dementia risk estimation in people affected by mild cognitive impairment: the AI-Mind clinical study protocol.,"More than 10 million Europeans show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal brain aging and dementia stage memory disorder. The path MCI takes can be divergent; while some maintain stability or even revert to cognitive norms, alarmingly, up to half of the cases progress to dementia within 5 years. Current diagnostic practice lacks the necessary screening tools to identify those at risk of progression. The European patient experience often involves a long journey from the initial signs of MCI to the eventual diagnosis of dementia. The trajectory is far from ideal. Here, we introduce the AI-Mind project, a pioneering initiative with an innovative approach to early risk assessment through the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) on multimodal data. The cutting-edge AI-based tools developed in the project aim not only to accelerate the diagnostic process but also to deliver highly accurate predictions regarding an individual's risk of developing dementia when prevention and intervention may still be possible.

Mobilise-D insights to estimate real-world walking speed in multiple conditions with a wearable device.,"This study aimed to validate a wearable device's walking speed estimation pipeline, considering complexity, speed, and walking bout duration. The goal was to provide recommendations on the use of wearable devices for real-world mobility analysis. Participants with Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Proximal Femoral Fracture, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Congestive Heart Failure, and healthy older adults (n = 97) were monitored in the laboratory and the real-world (2.5 h), using a lower back wearable device. Two walking speed estimation pipelines were validated across 4408/1298 (2.5 h/laboratory) detected walking bouts, compared to 4620/1365 bouts detected by a multi-sensor reference system. In the laboratory, the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE) for walking speed estimation ranged from 0.06 to 0.12 m/s and - 2.1 to 14.4%, with ICCs (Intraclass correlation coefficients) between good (0.79) and excellent (0.91). Real-world MAE ranged from 0.09 to 0.13, MARE from 1.3 to 22.7%, with ICCs indicating moderate (0.57) to good (0.88) agreement. Lower errors were observed for cohorts without major gait impairments, less complex tasks, and longer walking bouts. The analytical pipelines demonstrated moderate to good accuracy in estimating walking speed.

Single vesicle chemistry reveals partial release happens at the mechanical stress-induced exocytosis.,"Neuronal activity can be modulated by mechanical stress in the central nervous system (CNS) in neurodegenerative diseases, for example Alzheimer's disease. However, the impact of mechanical stress on chemical signal transmission, especially the storage and release of neurotransmitter in neuron vesicles, has not been fully clarified. In this study, a nanotip conical carbon fiber microelectrode (CFME) and a disk CFME are placed in and on a cell, respectively. The nanotip conical CFME functions for both the mechanical stress and the quantification of transmitter storage in single vesicles, while the disk CFME is used to monitor the transmitter release during exocytosis induced by mechanical stress at the same cell. By comparing the vesicular transmitter storage with its release during mechanical stress-induced exocytosis at the same cell, we find the release ratio of transmitter in chromaffin cells varies from 27 % to 100 %, while for PC12 cells from 30 % to 100 %. Our results indicate that the exocytosis of cells responding to mechanical stress shows individual difference obviously, with a significant population exhibiting partial release mode.

Shifting From Active to Passive Monitoring of Alzheimer Disease: The State of the Research.,"Most research using digital technologies builds on existing methods for staff-administered evaluation, requiring a large investment of time, effort, and resources. Widespread use of personal mobile devices provides opportunities for continuous health monitoring without active participant engagement. Home-based sensors show promise in evaluating behavioral features in near real time. Digital technologies across these methodologies can detect precise measures of cognition, mood, sleep, gait, speech, motor activity, behavior patterns, and additional features relevant to health. As a neurodegenerative condition with insidious onset, Alzheimer disease and other dementias (AD/D) represent a key target for advances in monitoring disease symptoms. Studies to date evaluating the predictive power of digital measures use inconsistent approaches to characterize these measures. Comparison between different digital collection methods supports the use of passive collection methods in settings in which active participant engagement approaches are not feasible. Additional studies that analyze how digital measures across multiple data streams can together improve prediction of cognitive impairment and early-stage AD are needed. Given the long timeline of progression from normal to diagnosis, digital monitoring will more easily make extended longitudinal follow-up possible. Through the American Heart Association-funded Strategically Focused Research Network, the Boston University investigative team deployed a platform involving a wide range of technologies to address these gaps in research practice. Much more research is needed to thoroughly evaluate limitations of passive monitoring.

Digital remote monitoring for screening and early detection of urinary tract infections.,"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are one of the most prevalent bacterial infections in older adults and a significant contributor to unplanned hospital admissions in People Living with Dementia (PLWD), with early detection being crucial due to the predicament of reporting symptoms and limited help-seeking behaviour. The most common diagnostic tool is urine sample analysis, which can be time-consuming and is only employed where UTI clinical suspicion exists. In this method development and proof-of-concept study, participants living with dementia were monitored via low-cost devices in the home that passively measure activity, sleep, and nocturnal physiology. Using 27828 person-days of remote monitoring data (from 117 participants), we engineered features representing symptoms used for diagnosing a UTI. We then evaluate explainable machine learning techniques in passively calculating UTI risk and perform stratification on scores to support clinical translation and allow control over the balance between alert rate and sensitivity and specificity. The proposed UTI algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 65.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 64.3-66.2) and specificity of 70.9% (68.6-73.1) when predicting UTIs on unseen participants and after risk stratification, a sensitivity of 74.7% (67.9-81.5) and specificity of 87.9% (85.0-90.9). In addition, feature importance methods reveal that the largest contributions to the predictions were bathroom visit statistics, night-time respiratory rate, and the number of previous UTI events, aligning with the literature.

"Agricultural activities and risk of Alzheimer's disease: the TRACTOR project, a nationwide retrospective cohort study.","Data regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurrence in farming populations is lacking. This study aimed to investigate whether, among the entire French farm manager (FM) workforce, certain agricultural activities are more strongly associated with AD than others, using nationwide data from the TRACTOR (Tracking and monitoring occupational risks in agriculture) project. Administrative health insurance data (digital electronic health/medical records and insurance claims) for the entire French agricultural workforce, over the period 2002-2016, on the entire mainland France were used to estimate the risk of AD for 26 agricultural activities with Cox proportional hazards model. For each analysis (one for each activity), the exposed group included all FMs that performed the activity of interest (e.g. crop farming), while the reference group included all FMs who did not carry out the activity of interest (e.g. FMs that never farmed crops between 2002 and 2016). There were 5067 cases among 1,036,069 FMs who worked at least one year between 2002 and 2016. Analyses showed higher risks of AD for crop farming (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.72 [3.47-3.98]), viticulture (HR = 1.29 [1.18-1.42]), and fruit arboriculture (HR = 1.36 [1.15-1.62]). By contrast, lower risks of AD were found for several animal farming types, in particular for poultry and rabbit farming (HR = 0.29 [0.20-0.44]), ovine and caprine farming (HR = 0.50 [0.41-0.61]), mixed dairy and cow farming (HR = 0.46 [0.37-0.57]), dairy farming (HR = 0.67 [0.61-0.73]), and pig farming (HR = 0.30 [0.18-0.52]).

Shared genetic architectures of educational attainment in East Asian and European populations.,"Educational attainment (EduYears), a heritable trait often used as a proxy for cognitive ability, is associated with various health and social outcomes. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on EduYears have been focused on samples of European (EUR) genetic ancestries. Here we present the first large-scale GWAS of EduYears in people of East Asian (EAS) ancestry (n = 176,400) and conduct a cross-ancestry meta-analysis with EduYears GWAS in people of EUR ancestry (n = 766,345). EduYears showed a high genetic correlation and power-adjusted transferability ratio between EAS and EUR. We also found similar functional enrichment, gene expression enrichment and cross-trait genetic correlations between two populations. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping identified refined credible sets with a higher posterior inclusion probability than single population fine-mapping. Polygenic prediction analysis in four independent EAS and EUR cohorts demonstrated transferability between populations.

Intron retention as a productive mechanism in human MAPT: RNA species generated by retention of intron 3.,"Tau is a microtubule-binding protein encoded by the MAPT gene. Tau is essential for several physiological functions and associated with pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Six tau isoforms are typically described in the central nervous system, but current research paints a more diverse landscape and a more nuanced balance between isoforms. Recent work has described tau isoforms generated by intron 11 and intron 12 retention. This work adds to that evidence, proving the existence of MAPT transcripts retaining intron 3.

Comprehensive allostatic load risk index is associated with increased frontal and left parietal white matter hyperintensities in mid-life cognitively healthy adults.,"To date, there is a considerable heterogeneity of methods to score Allostatic Load (AL). Here we propose a comprehensive algorithm (ALCS) that integrates commonly used approaches to generate AL risk categories and assess associations to brain structure deterioration. In a cohort of cognitively normal mid-life adults (n = 620, age 51.3 ± 5.48 years), we developed a comprehensive composite for AL scoring incorporating gender and age differences, high quartile approach, clinical reference values, and current medications, to then generate AL risk categories. Compared to the empirical approach (ALES), ALCS showed better model fit criteria and a strong association with age and sex. ALSC categories were regressed against brain and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes. Higher AL risk categories were associated with increased total, periventricular, frontal, and left parietal WMH volumes, also showing better fit compared to ALES. When cardiovascular biomarkers were removed from the ALSC algorithm, only left-frontal WMHV remained associated with AL, revealing a strong vascular burden influencing the index. Our results agree with previous evidence and suggest that sustained stress exposure enhances brain deterioration in mid-life adults. Showing better fit than ALES, our comprehensive algorithm can provide a more accurate AL estimation to explore how stress exposure enhances age-related health decline.",2024,,Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; White Matter; Allostasis; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Buller-Peralta, I; Gregory, S; Low, A; Dounavi, ME; Bridgeman, K; Ntailianis, G; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Koychev, I; Malhotra, P; O'Brien, JT; Ritchie, CW; Muniz-Terrera, G"

Subject Harmonization of Digital Biomarkers: Improved Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the early stage of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a crucial stage for therapeutic interventions and treatment. Early detection of MCI offers opportunities for early intervention and significantly benefits cohort enrichment for clinical trials. Imaging and in vivo markers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have high detection performance, yet their prohibitive costs and intrusiveness demand more affordable and accessible alternatives. The recent advances in digital biomarkers, especially language markers, have shown great potential, where variables informative to MCI are derived from linguistic and/or speech and later used for predictive modeling. A major challenge in modeling language markers comes from the variability of how each person speaks. As the cohort size for language studies is usually small due to extensive data collection efforts, the variability among persons makes language markers hard to generalize to unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel subject harmonization tool to address the issue of distributional differences in language markers across subjects, thus enhancing the generalization performance of machine learning models. Our empirical results show that machine learning models built on our harmonized features have improved prediction performance on unseen data.

Resting-state EEG signatures of Alzheimer's disease are driven by periodic but not aperiodic changes.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasize the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",2024,Alzheimer's; Dementia; EEG; Oscillations,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Electroencephalography; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Rest,"Kopčanová, M; Tait, L; Donoghue, T; Stothart, G; Smith, L; Flores-Sandoval, AA; Davila-Perez, P; Buss, S; Shafi, MM; Pascual-Leone, A; Fried, PJ; Benwell, CSY"

Magnetic resonance image-based brain age as a discriminator of dementia conversion in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"Patients with amyloid-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a conversion rate of approximately 10% to dementia within 2 years. We aimed to investigate whether brain age is an important factor in predicting conversion to dementia in patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with amyloid-negative amnestic MCI. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychological evaluation, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and [18F]-florbetaben positron emission tomography. Brain age was determined by the volumetric assessment of 12 distinct brain regions using an automatic segmentation software. During the follow-up period, 38% of the patients converted from amnestic MCI to dementia. Further, 73% of patients had a brain age greater than their actual chronological age.

High-throughput target trial emulation for Alzheimer's disease drug repurposing with real-world data.,"Target trial emulation is the process of mimicking target randomized trials using real-world data, where effective confounding control for unbiased treatment effect estimation remains a main challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed for this challenge, a systematic evaluation is still lacking. Here we emulated trials for thousands of medications from two large-scale real-world data warehouses, covering over 10 years of clinical records for over 170 million patients, aiming to identify new indications of approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease. We assessed different propensity score models under the inverse probability of treatment weighting framework and suggested a model selection strategy for improved baseline covariate balancing. We also found that the deep learning-based propensity score model did not necessarily outperform logistic regression-based methods in covariate balancing. Finally, we highlighted five top-ranked drugs (pantoprazole, gabapentin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, and omeprazole) originally intended for other indications with potential benefits for Alzheimer's patients.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Drug Repositioning; Propensity Score; Atorvastatin,"Zang, C; Zhang, H; Xu, J; Zhang, H; Fouladvand, S; Havaldar, S; Cheng, F; Chen, K; Chen, Y; Glicksberg, BS; Chen, J; Bian, J; Wang, F"

The effect of EEG and fNIRS in the digital assessment and digital therapy of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,"In the context of population aging, the growing problem of Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a great challenge to mankind. Although there has been considerable progress in exploring the etiology of AD, i.e., the important role of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the progression of AD has been widely accepted by the scientific community, traditional treatment and monitoring modalities have significant limitations. Therefore novel evaluation and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease are called for emergence. In this research, we sought to review the effectiveness of digital treatment based on monitoring using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). This work searched four electronic databases using a keyword approach and focused on journals focusing on AD and geriatric cognition. Finally, 21 articles were included. The progress of digital therapy and outcome monitoring in AD was reviewed, including digital therapy approaches on different platforms and different neuromonitoring techniques. Because biomarkers such as theta coherence, alpha and beta rhythms, and oxyhemoglobin are effective in monitoring the cognitive level of AD patients, and thus the efficacy of digital therapies, this review particularly focuses on the biomarker validation results of digital therapies. The results show that digital treatment based on biomarker monitoring has good effectiveness. And the effectiveness is reflected in the numerical changes of biomarker indicators monitored by EEG and fNIRS before and after digital treatment. Increases or decreases in the values of these indicators collectively point to improvements in cognitive function (mostly moderate to large effect sizes). The study is the first to examine the state of digital therapy in AD from the perspective of multimodal monitoring, which broadens the research perspective on the effectiveness of AD and gives clinical therapists a ""reference list"" of treatment options. They can select a specific protocol from this ""reference list"" in order to tailor digital therapy to the needs of individual patients.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; EEG; digital assessment; digital therapy; fNIRS,,"Zhang, Y; Zhang, Y; Jiang, Z; Xu, M; Qing, K"
The association between dietary inflammatory index and cognitive function in adults with/without chronic kidney disease.,"Cognitive impairment (CI) is a prevalent condition in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who face an elevated risk of developing cognitive decline. The fundamental mechanism underlying CI is linked to chronic inflammation, which can be gauged by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). The DII is categorized into anti-inflammatory diets with lower scores and pro-inflammatory diets with higher scores. Specifically, pro-inflammatory diets may contribute to chronic inflammation. However, the correlation between the inflammatory potential of diet and cognitive function in patients with CKD has not been explored. This study aims to investigate the connection between the inflammatory potential of diet and cognitive function in individuals with or without chronic kidney disease.",2023,aging; cognitive function; diet; dietary inflammatory index; inflammation,,"Wan, B; Lin, P; Wang, M; Zhong, J; Peng, L; Tang, X; Wang, L; Tang, F; Liang, Y; Liu, X; Deng, L"

Digital phenotyping: An equal opportunity approach to reducing disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"A rapidly aging world population is fueling a concomitant increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Scientific inquiry, however, has largely focused on White populations in Australia, the European Union, and North America. As such, there is an incomplete understanding of AD in other populations. In this perspective, we describe research efforts and challenges of cohort studies from three regions of the world: Central America, East Africa, and East Asia. These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

Application of machine learning in dementia diagnosis: A systematic literature review.,"According to the World Health Organization forecast, over 55 million people worldwide have dementia, and about 10 million new cases are detected yearly. Early diagnosis is essential for patients to plan for the future and deal with the disease. Machine Learning algorithms allow us to solve the problems associated with early disease detection. This work attempts to identify the current relevance of the application of machine learning in dementia prediction in the scientific world and suggests open fields for future research. The literature review was conducted by combining bibliometric and content analysis of articles originating in a period of 20 years in the Scopus database. Twenty-seven thousand five hundred twenty papers were identified firstly, of which a limited number focused on machine learning in dementia diagnosis. After the exclusion process, 202 were selected, and 25 were chosen for analysis. The recent increasing interest in the past five years in the theme of machine learning in dementia shows that it is a relevant field for research with still open questions. The methods used to identify dementia or what features are used to identify or predict this disease are explored in this study. The literature review revealed that most studies used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its types as the main feature, accompanied by demographic data such as age, gender, and the mini-mental state examination score (MMSE). Data are usually acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification of Alzheimer's disease is more prevalent than prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or their combination. The authors preferred machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Ensemble methods, and CNN because of their excellent performance and results in previous studies. However, most use not one machine-learning technique but a combination of techniques. Despite achieving good results in the studies considered, there are new concepts for future investigation declared by the authors and suggestions for improvements by employing promising methods with potentially significant results.",2023,0000; 1111; Alzheimer's disease; Dementia; Machine learning; Neurodegenerative diseases,,"Kantayeva, G; Lima, J; Pereira, AI"

TANGO: a placebo-controlled randomized phase 2 study of efficacy and safety of the anti-tau monoclonal antibody gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease, the spread of aberrantly phosphorylated tau is an important criterion in the Braak staging of disease severity and correlates with disease symptomatology. Here, we report the results of TANGO ( NCT03352557 ), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and multiple-dose long-term trial of gosuranemab-a monoclonal antibody to N-terminal tau-in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of gosuranemab compared to placebo. The secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of multiple doses of gosuranemab in slowing cognitive and functional impairment (using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores at week 78) and evaluate the immunogenicity of gosuranemab (using the incidence of anti-gosuranemab antibody responses). Participants were randomized (n = 654); received (n = 650) low-dose (125 mg once every 4 weeks (q4w), n = 58; 375 mg q12w, n = 58), intermediate-dose (600 mg q4w, n = 106) or high-dose (2,000 mg q4w, n = 214) gosuranemab or placebo (q4w, n = 214) intravenously for 78 weeks; and assigned to cerebrospinal fluid (n = 327) and/or tau positron emission tomography (n = 357) biomarker substudies. Gosuranemab had an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated (incidence of serious adverse events: placebo, 12.1%; low dose, 10.3%; intermediate dose, 12.3%; high dose, 11.7%). The incidence of treatment-emergent gosuranemab antibody responses was low at all time points. No significant effects were identified in cognitive and functional tests as no dose resulted in a favorable change from the baseline CDR-SB score at week 78 compared to placebo control (adjusted mean change: placebo, 1.85; low dose, 2.20; intermediate dose, 2.24; high dose, 1.85). At week 76, all doses caused significant (P < 0.0001) reductions in the cerebrospinal fluid levels of unbound N-terminal tau compared to placebo.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antibodies, Monoclonal","Shulman, M; Kong, J; O'Gorman, J; Ratti, E; Rajagovindan, R; Viollet, L; Huang, E; Sharma, S; Racine, AM; Czerkowicz, J; Graham, D; Li, Y; Hering, H; Haeberlein, SB"
"Preclinical Studies of Canagliflozin, a Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitor, and Donepezil Combined Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease.","The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), is continuously growing worldwide, which leads to a heavy economic and societal burden. The lack of a safe and effective causal therapy in cognitive decline is an aggravating factor and requires investigations into the repurposing of commonly used drugs. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new and efficient class of hypoglycemic drugs and, due to their pleiotropic effects, have indications that go beyond diabetes. There is emerging data from murine studies that SGLT2i can cross the blood-brain barrier and may have neuroprotective effects, such as increasing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), reducing the amyloid burden, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and restoring the circadian rhythm in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. The current study investigates the effect of an SGLT2i and donepezil, under a separate or combined 21-day treatment on AD-relevant behaviors and brain pathology in mice. The SGLT2i canagliflozin was found to significantly improve the novelty preference index and the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the maze in the novel object recognition and elevated plus maze test, respectively. In addition, canagliflozin therapy decreased AChE activity, mTOR and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. The results also recorded the acetylcholine M1 receptor in canagliflozin-treated mice compared to the scopolamine group. In the hippocampus, the SGLT2i canagliflozin reduced the microgliosis and astrogliosis in males, but not in female mice. These findings emphasize the value of SGLT2i in clinical practice. By inhibiting AChE activity, canagliflozin represents a compound that resembles AD-registered therapies in this respect, supporting the need for further evaluation in dementia clinical trials.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; SGLT2i; acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; canagliflozin; donepezil; mTOR,,"Stanciu, GD; Ababei, DC; Solcan, C; Bild, V; Ciobica, A; Beschea Chiriac, SI; Ciobanu, LM; Tamba, BI"

Recent Research Progress in Fluorescent Probes for Detection of Amyloid-β In Vivo.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Due to its complex pathological mechanism, its etiology is not yet clear. As one of the main pathological markers of AD, amyloid-β (Aβ) plays an important role in the development of AD. The deposition of Aβ is not only related to the degeneration of neurons, but also can activate a series of pathological events, including the activation of astrocytes and microglia, the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and the change in microcirculation, which is the main cause of brain lesions and death in AD patients. Therefore, the development of efficient and reliable Aβ-specific probes is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD. This paper focuses on reviewing the application of small-molecule fluorescent probes in Aβ imaging in vivo in recent years. These probes efficiently map the presence of Aβ in vivo, providing a pathway for the early diagnosis of AD and providing enlightenment for the design of Aβ-specific probes in the future.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); amyloid-β (Aβ); bioimaging; fluorescent probe,Humans; Fluorescent Dyes; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease,"Zhang, ZY; Li, ZJ; Tang, YH; Xu, L; Zhang, DT; Qin, TY; Wang, YL"

The identification of the lifestyle factors that potentially help prevent or postpone disease onset is of interest to the researchers. Although the study results are inconsistent, one such factor that has been extensively studied is coffee consumption. Therefore, this meta-analysis primarily aimed to investigate the effects of coffee consumption on the risk of AD. Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science (Only Writing Web of Science is Fine) databases were searched for relevant studies with the keywords in various combinations, including ""coffee"", ""caffeine"", and ""Alzheimer's disease"". This meta-analysis included 11 studies. The relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated to estimate the effect size. The study used the restricted maximum-likelihood method for a generic-inverse-variance analysis with random-effect (when heterogeneity, I",2023,Alzheimer disease; Caffeine; Coffee; Meta-analysis; Risk; Systematic review,,"Nila, IS; Villagra Moran, VM; Khan, ZA; Hong, Y"
Gut inflammation associated with age and Alzheimer's disease pathology: a human cohort study.,"Age-related disease may be mediated by low levels of chronic inflammation (""inflammaging""). Recent work suggests that gut microbes can contribute to inflammation via degradation of the intestinal barrier. While aging and age-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) are linked to altered microbiome composition and higher levels of gut microbial components in systemic circulation, the role of intestinal inflammation remains unclear. To investigate whether greater gut inflammation is associated with advanced age and AD pathology, we assessed fecal samples from older adults to measure calprotectin, an established marker of intestinal inflammation which is elevated in diseases of gut barrier integrity. Multiple regression with maximum likelihood estimation and Satorra-Bentler corrections were used to test relationships between fecal calprotectin and clinical diagnosis, participant age, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD pathology, amyloid burden measured using ",2023,,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cohort Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid; Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Cognitive Dysfunction","Heston, MB; Hanslik, KL; Zarbock, KR; Harding, SJ; Davenport-Sis, NJ; Kerby, RL; Chin, N; Sun, Y; Hoeft, A; Deming, Y; Vogt, NM; Betthauser, TJ; Johnson, SC; Asthana, S; Kollmorgen, G; Suridjan, I; Wild, N; Zetterberg, H; Blennow, K; Rey, FE; Bendlin, BB; Ulland, TK"
Rapid and signal crowdedness-robust in situ sequencing through hybrid block coding.,"Spatial transcriptomics technology has revolutionized our understanding of cell types and tissue organization, opening possibilities for researchers to explore transcript distributions at subcellular levels. However, existing methods have limitations in resolution, sensitivity, or speed. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SPRINTseq (Spatially Resolved and signal-diluted Next-generation Targeted sequencing), an innovative in situ sequencing strategy that combines hybrid block coding and molecular dilution strategies. Our method enables fast and sensitive high-resolution data acquisition, as demonstrated by recovering over 142 million transcripts using a 108-gene panel from 453,843 cells from four mouse brain coronal slices in less than 2 d. Using this advanced technology, we uncover the cellular and subcellular molecular architecture of Alzheimer's disease, providing additional information into abnormal cellular behaviors and their subcellular mRNA distribution.

Employing Deep-Learning Approach for the Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Transitions through the Analysis of Digital Biomarkers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the precursor to the advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it is important to detect the transition to the MCI condition as early as possible. Trends in daily routines/activities provide a measurement of cognitive/functional status, particularly in older adults. In this study, activity data from longitudinal monitoring through in-home ambient sensors are leveraged in predicting the transition to the MCI stage at a future time point. The activity dataset from the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) includes measures representing various domains such as walk, sleep, etc. Each sensor-captured activity measure is constructed as a time series, and a variety of summary statistics is computed. The similarity between one individual's activity time series and that of the remaining individuals is also computed as distance measures. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is trained with time series statistics and distance measures for the prediction modeling, and performance is evaluated by classification accuracy. The model outcomes are explained using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. LSTM model trained using the time series statistics and distance measures outperforms other modeling scenarios, including baseline classifiers, with an overall prediction accuracy of 83.84%. SHAP values reveal that sleep-related features contribute the most to the prediction of the cognitive stage at the future time point, and this aligns with the findings in the literature. Findings from this study not only demonstrate that a practical, less expensive, longitudinal monitoring of older adults' activity routines can benefit immensely in modeling AD progression but also unveil the most contributing features that are medically applicable and meaningful.",2023,AD progression; MCI transition; RNN LSTM; daily activities; deep learning; digital biomarkers; time series statistic,Humans; Aged; Deep Learning; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Aging,"Narasimhan, R; Gopalan, M; Sikkandar, MY; Alassaf, A; AlMohimeed, I; Alhussaini, K; Aleid, A; Sheik, SB"

High-throughput digital quantification of Alzheimer disease pathology and associated infrastructure in large autopsy studies.,"High-throughput digital pathology offers considerable advantages over traditional semiquantitative and manual methods of counting pathology. We used brain tissue from 5 clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging; the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, the Minority Aging Research Study, the African American Clinical Core, and the Latino Core to (1) develop a workflow management system for digital pathology processes, (2) optimize digital algorithms to quantify Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, and (3) harmonize data statistically. Data from digital algorithms for the quantification of β-amyloid (Aβ, n = 413) whole slide images and tau-tangles (n = 639) were highly correlated with manual pathology data (r = 0.83 to 0.94). Measures were robust and reproducible across different magnifications and repeated scans. Digital measures for Aβ and tau-tangles across multiple brain regions reproduced established patterns of correlations, even when samples were stratified by clinical diagnosis. Finally, we harmonized newly generated digital measures with historical measures across multiple large autopsy-based studies. We describe a multidisciplinary approach to develop a digital pathology pipeline that reproducibly identifies AD neuropathologies, Aβ load, and tau-tangles.

"In severe ADNC, hippocampi with comorbid LATE-NC and hippocampal sclerosis have substantially more astrocytosis than those with LATE-NC or hippocampal sclerosis alone.","Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) and hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-A) pathologies are found together at autopsy in ∼20% of elderly demented persons. Although astrocytosis is known to occur in neurodegenerative diseases, it is currently unknown how the severity of astrocytosis is correlated with the common combinations of pathologies in aging brains. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed a convenience sample of autopsied subjects from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center community-based autopsy cohort. The subjects were stratified into 5 groups (n = 51 total): pure ADNC, ADNC + LATE-NC, ADNC + HS-A, ADNC + LATE-NC + HS-A, and low-pathology controls. Following GFAP immunostaining and digital slide scanning with a ScanScope, we measured GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytosis. The severities of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytosis in hippocampal subfield CA1 and subiculum were compared between groups. The group with ADNC + LATE-NC + HS-A had the most astrocytosis as operationalized by either any GFAP+ or strong GFAP+ immunoreactivity in both CA1 and subiculum. In comparison to that pathologic combination, ADNC + HS or ADNC + LATE-NC alone showed lower astrocytosis. Pure ADNC had only marginally increased astrocytosis in CA1 and subiculum, in comparison to low-pathology controls. We conclude that there appeared to be pathogenetic synergy such that ADNC + LATE-NC + HS-A cases had relatively high levels of astrocytosis in the hippocampal formation.",2023,ADRD; Astrocytes; Digital pathology; Gliosis; Hippocampal sclerosis; Inflammation; ScanScope,Aged; Humans; Gliosis; Hippocampal Sclerosis; Neuropathology; Hippocampus,"Niedowicz, DM; Katsumata, Y; Nelson, PT"
Learning Spatio-Temporal Model of Disease Progression With NeuralODEs From Longitudinal Volumetric Data.,"Robust forecasting of the future anatomical changes inflicted by an ongoing disease is an extremely challenging task that is out of grasp even for experienced healthcare professionals. Such a capability, however, is of great importance since it can improve patient management by providing information on the speed of disease progression already at the admission stage, or it can enrich the clinical trials with fast progressors and avoid the need for control arms by the means of digital twins. In this work, we develop a deep learning method that models the evolution of age-related disease by processing a single medical scan and providing a segmentation of the target anatomy at a requested future point in time. Our method represents a time-invariant physical process and solves a large-scale problem of modeling temporal pixel-level changes utilizing NeuralODEs. In addition, we demonstrate the approaches to incorporate the prior domain-specific constraints into our method and define temporal Dice loss for learning temporal objectives. To evaluate the applicability of our approach across different age-related diseases and imaging modalities, we developed and tested the proposed method on the datasets with 967 retinal OCT volumes of 100 patients with Geographic Atrophy and 2823 brain MRI volumes of 633 patients with Alzheimer's Disease. For Geographic Atrophy, the proposed method outperformed the related baseline models in the atrophy growth prediction. For Alzheimer's Disease, the proposed method demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting the brain ventricle changes induced by the disease, achieving the state-of-the-art result on TADPOLE cross-sectional prediction challenge dataset.",2024,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Geographic Atrophy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Disease Progression,"Lachinov, D; Chakravarty, A; Grechenig, C; Schmidt-Erfurth, U; Bogunovic, H"
Prefrontal event-related potential markers in association with mild cognitive impairment.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the leading contributors of dementia globally with approximately 60-70% of its cases. Current research is focused on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with cognitive decline but does not disrupt routine activities. Event-related potential (ERP) research is essential in screening patients with MCI. Low-density channel electroencephalography (EEG) is frequently used due to its convenience, portability, and affordability, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. Despite extensive research on neural biomarkers for cognitive impairment, there is a considerable gap in understanding the effects on early stages of cognitive processes, particularly when combining physiological and cognitive markers using portable devices. The present study aimed to examine cognitive shortfalls and behavioral changes in patients with MCI using prefrontal selective attention ERP recorded from a prefrontal two-channel EEG device.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; behavioral measure; cognitive function; electroencephalography; event-related potential; mild cognitive impairment; screening tool,,"Eyamu, J; Kim, WS; Kim, K; Lee, KH; Kim, JU"
Predictors of hippocampal tauopathy in people with and at risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has extended lifespans of people living with HIV (PWH), increasing both the risk for age-related neuropathologies and the importance of distinguishing effects of HIV and its comorbidities from neurodegenerative disorders. The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in hippocampus is a common degenerative change, with specific patterns of hippocampal subfield vulnerability observed in different disease contexts. Currently, associations between chronic HIV, its comorbidities, and p-tau burden and distribution in the hippocampus are unexplored. We used immunohistochemistry with antibody AT8 to analyze hippocampal p-tau in brain tissues of PWH (n = 71) and HIV negative controls (n = 25), for whom comprehensive clinical data were available. Using a morphology-based neuroanatomical segmentation protocol, we annotated digital slide images to measure percentage p-tau areas in the hippocampus and its subfields. Factors predicting p-tau burden and distribution were identified in univariate analyses, and those with significance at p ≤ 0.100 were advanced to multivariable regression. The patient sample had a mean age of 61.5 years. Age predicted overall hippocampal p-tau burden. Subfield p-tau predictors were for Cornu Ammonis (CA)1, age; for CA2 and subiculum, seizure history; for CA3, seizure history and head trauma; and for CA4/dentate, history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In this autopsy sample, hippocampal p-tau burden and distribution were not predicted by HIV, viral load, or immunologic status, with viral effects limited to associations between HCV and CA4/dentate vulnerability. Hippocampal p-tau pathologies in cART-era PWH appear to reflect age and comorbidities, but not direct effects of HIV infection.",2023,Comorbidities; Hippocampus; Human immunodeficiency virus; Tauopathy,Humans; Middle Aged; HIV Infections; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Tauopathies; Seizures; Hepatitis C,"Nader, S; Karlovich, E; Cortes, EP; Insausti, R; Meloni, G; Jacobs, M; Crary, JF; Morgello, S"
Personalized relapse prediction in patients with major depressive disorder using digital biomarkers.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic illness wherein relapses contribute to significant patient morbidity and mortality. Near-term prediction of relapses in MDD patients has the potential to improve outcomes by helping implement a 'predict and preempt' paradigm in clinical care. In this study, we developed a novel personalized (N-of-1) encoder-decoder anomaly detection-based framework of combining anomalies in multivariate actigraphy features (passive) as triggers to utilize an active concurrent self-reported symptomatology questionnaire (core symptoms of depression and anxiety) to predict near-term relapse in MDD. The framework was evaluated on two independent longitudinal observational trials, characterized by regular bimonthly (every other month) in-person clinical assessments, weekly self-reported symptom assessments, and continuous activity monitoring data with two different wearable sensors for ≥ 1 year or until the first relapse episode. This combined passive-active relapse prediction framework achieved a balanced accuracy of ≥ 71%, false alarm rate of ≤ 2.3 alarm/patient/year with a median relapse detection time of 2-3 weeks in advance of clinical onset in both studies. The study results suggest that the proposed personalized N-of-1 prediction framework is generalizable and can help predict a majority of MDD relapses in an actionable time frame with relatively low patient and provider burden.",2023,,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Biomarkers; Chronic Disease; Self Report; Recurrence","Vairavan, S; Rashidisabet, H; Li, QS; Ness, S; Morrison, RL; Soares, CN; Uher, R; Frey, BN; Lam, RW; Kennedy, SH; Trivedi, M; Drevets, WC; Narayan, VA"

EPIC Spinal Procedure with Sound Wave Technology Induces Biomechanical Alignment Putatively Influencing Pain Response.,"Spinal biomechanical alignment is now able to be altered through the use of unique sound wave technology. This methodological commentary will correlate recent studies demonstrating the ability of sound waves to carry mass, how the EPIC technique spinal procedure uses a sound wave impulse to create measurable changes in spinal alignment, and the clinical safety and efficacy of this approach. The EPIC technique is a direct genealogical descendant of the technique originally developed by the founding family of chiropractic. With sound wave therapies currently being used to break up kidney stones, called lithotripsy, in physical therapy for the treatment of soft tissue injuries, in the treatment of prostate cancer, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, it is possible that the use of sound wave therapies may enter into the realm of altering joint biomechanics. Through a neurovascular examination, the EPIC technique spinal procedure can ascertain the presence of craniocervical subluxation, followed by acquiring multi-dimensional radiographic images for structural analysis. Currently using digital radiographic analysis, the EPIC technique acquires an epigenetic profile of structural asymmetries as well as a multi-directional biomechanical malposition profile of the spine, combining both profiles to ascertain the exact degrees for realignment. EPIC clinics have successfully utilized EPIC on over 20,000 cases. Comparison of pre-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra around the Z-axis measured on digital radiographs, and post-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra measured on digital radiographs immediately following the procedure, demonstrated an average 52% reduction in lateral biomechanical displacement around the Z-axis in a select group of over 2,000 cases.

Artificial sharp-wave-ripples to support memory and counter neurodegeneration.,"Information processed in our sensory neocortical areas is transported to the hippocampus during memory encoding, and between hippocampus and neocortex during memory consolidation, and retrieval. Short bursts of high-frequency oscillations, so called sharp-wave-ripples, have been proposed as a potential mechanism for this information transfer: They can synchronize neural activity to support the formation of local neural networks to store information, and between distant cortical sites to act as a bridge to transfer information between sensory cortical areas and hippocampus. In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease, different neuropathological processes impair normal neural functioning and neural synchronization as well as sharp-wave-ripples, which impairs consolidation and retrieval of information, and compromises memory. Here, we formulate a new hypothesis, that artificially inducing sharp-wave-ripples with noninvasive high-frequency visual stimulation could potentially support memory functioning, as well as target the neuropathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

The PRISM project presents here initial quantitative biological insights allowing the first steps toward a novel trans-diagnostic classification of psychiatric and neurological symptomatology intended to reinvigorate drug discovery in this area. In this study, we applied spectral clustering on digital behavioural endpoints derived from passive smartphone monitoring data in a subgroup of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as age matched healthy controls, as part of the PRISM clinical study. This analysis provided an objective social functioning characterization with three differential clusters that transcended initial diagnostic classification and was shown to be linked to quantitative neurobiological parameters assessed. This emerging quantitative framework will both offer new ways to classify individuals in biologically homogenous clusters irrespective of their initial diagnosis, and also offer insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these clusters.",2024,Behaviour; Clustering analysis; Digital phenotyping; Neuro-imaging; Neurology; Psychiatry,Humans; Schizophrenia; Alzheimer Disease,"Kas, MJH; Jongs, N; Mennes, M; Penninx, BWJH; Arango, C; van der Wee, N; Winter-van Rossum, I; Ayuso-Mateos, JL; Bilderbeck, AC; l'Hostis, P; Beckmann, CF; Dawson, GR; Sommer, B; Marston, HM"
Digital Marker for Early Screening of Mild Cognitive Impairment Through Hand and Eye Movement Analysis in Virtual Reality Using Machine Learning: First Validation Study.,"With the global rise in Alzheimer disease (AD), early screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a preclinical stage of AD, is of paramount importance. Although biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid amyloid level and magnetic resonance imaging have been studied, they have limitations, such as high cost and invasiveness. Digital markers to assess cognitive impairment by analyzing behavioral data collected from digital devices in daily life can be a new alternative. In this context, we developed a ""virtual kiosk test"" for early screening of MCI by analyzing behavioral data collected when using a kiosk in a virtual environment.",2023,Alzheimer disease; biomarkers; dementia; digital markers; eye movement; hand movement; machine learning; mild cognitive impairment; screening; virtual reality,Humans; Eye Movements; Reproducibility of Results; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Machine Learning; Biomarkers; Virtual Reality,"Kim, SY; Park, J; Choi, H; Loeser, M; Ryu, H; Seo, K"

Quantitative analysis of prion disease using an AI-powered digital pathology framework.,"Prion disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of an abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) in the central nervous system. To identify PrPSc aggregates for diagnostic purposes, pathologists use immunohistochemical staining of prion protein antibodies on tissue samples. With digital pathology, artificial intelligence can now analyze stained slides. In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for the identification of PrPSc aggregates in tissue samples from the cerebellar and occipital cortex. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to evaluate PrPSc deposition in digital images. We used two strategies: a deep learning segmentation approach using a vision transformer, and a machine learning classification approach with traditional classifiers. Our method was developed and tested on 64 whole slide images from 41 patients definitively diagnosed with prion disease. The results of our study demonstrated that our proposed framework can accurately classify WSIs from a blind test set. Moreover, it can quantify PrPSc distribution and localization throughout the brain. This could potentially be extended to evaluate protein expression in other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Overall, our pipeline highlights the potential of AI-assisted pathology to provide valuable insights, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.",2023,,Humans; Prion Proteins; Artificial Intelligence; Prion Diseases; Brain; Machine Learning,"Salvi, M; Molinari, F; Ciccarelli, M; Testi, R; Taraglio, S; Imperiale, D"

Ultrasound-enhanced catalytic hairpin assembly capable of ultrasensitive microRNA biosensing for the early screening of Alzheimer's disease.,"Catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) is a promising enzyme-free, isothermal signal amplification strategy, but the relatively time-consuming strand replacement limits its application scenarios. Here, we developed an ultrasound-enhanced catalytic hairpin assembly (UECHA) biosensing platform for early screening of Alzheimer's disease by introducing a portable acoustic-drive platform with functionalized microspheres for effective biomarkers enrichment and fluorescence enhancement. By constructing a gradient ultrasonic field in a microcavity, the platform concentrates the functionalized microspheres in a central position, accompanied by an enhanced fluorescence signal with a specific release. In addition, the programmable frequency modulation can also modify the acoustic potential well and effectively promote non-equilibrium chemical reactions such as CHA (25 min).

Histopathological whole slide images provide a wealth of pathologic data on the cellular level that can be leveraged to build deep learning models to assess age acceleration. Here, we used a collection of digitized human post-mortem hippocampal sections to develop a histological brain age estimation model. Our model predicted brain age within a mean absolute error of 5.45 ± 0.22 years, with attention weights corresponding to neuroanatomical regions vulnerable to age-related changes.

Real-world prediction of preclinical Alzheimer's disease with a deep generative model.,"Amyloid positivity is an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease and is necessary to determine the disease. In this study, a deep generative model is utilized to predict the amyloid positivity of cognitively normal individuals using proxy measures, such as structural MRI scans, demographic variables, and cognitive scores, instead of invasive direct measurements. Through its remarkable efficacy in handling imperfect datasets caused by missing data or labels, and imbalanced classes, the model outperforms previous studies and widely used machine learning approaches with an AUROC of 0.8609. Furthermore, this study illuminates the model's adaptability to diverse clinical scenarios, even when feature sets or diagnostic criteria differ from the training data. We identify the brain regions and variables that contribute most to classification, including the lateral occipital lobes, posterior temporal lobe, and APOE ϵ4 allele.

Alteration of Neural Network and Hippocampal Slice Activation through Exosomes Derived from 5XFAD Nasal Lavage Fluid.,"Exosomes, key mediators of intercellular transmission of pathogenic proteins, such as amyloid-beta and tau, significantly influence the progression and exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Present in a variety of biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, saliva, and nasal lavage fluid (NLF), exosomes underscore their potential as integral mediators of AD pathology. By serving as vehicles for disease-specific molecules, exosomes could unveil valuable insights into disease identification and progression. This study emphasizes the imperative to investigate the impacts of exosomes on neural networks to enhance our comprehension of intracerebral neuronal communication and its implications for neurological disorders like AD. After harvesting exosomes derived from NLF of 5XFAD mice, we utilized a high-density multielectrode array (HD-MEA) system, the novel technology enabling concurrent recordings from thousands of neurons in primary cortical neuron cultures and organotypic hippocampal slices. The ensuing results revealed a surge in neuronal firing rates and disoriented neural connectivity, reflecting the effects provoked by pathological amyloid-beta oligomer treatment. The local field potentials in the exosome-treated hippocampal brain slices also exhibited aberrant rhythmicity, along with an elevated level of current source density.

Toward Personalized Medicine Approaches for Parkinson Disease Using Digital Technologies.,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts over 10 million people worldwide, resulting in debilitating motor and cognitive impairment. In the United States alone (with approximately 1 million cases), the economic burden for treating and caring for persons with PD exceeds US $50 billion and myriad therapeutic approaches are under development, including both symptomatic- and disease-modifying agents. The challenges presented in addressing PD are compounded by observations that numerous, statistically distinct patient phenotypes present with a wide variety of motor and nonmotor symptomatic profiles, varying responses to current standard-of-care symptom-alleviating medications (L-DOPA and dopaminergic agonists), and different disease trajectories. The existence of these differing phenotypes highlights the opportunities in personalized approaches to symptom management and disease control. The prodromal period of PD can span across several decades, allowing the potential to leverage the unique array of composite symptoms presented to trigger early interventions. This may be especially beneficial as disease progression in PD (alongside Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease) may be influenced by biological processes such as oxidative stress, offering the potential for individual lifestyle factors to be tailored to delay disease onset. In this viewpoint, we offer potential scenarios where emerging diagnostic and monitoring strategies might be tailored to the individual patient under the tenets of P4 medicine (predict, prevent, personalize, and participate). These approaches may be especially relevant as the causative factors and biochemical pathways responsible for the observed neurodegeneration in patients with PD remain areas of fluid debate. The numerous observational patient cohorts established globally offer an excellent opportunity to test and refine approaches to detect, characterize, control, modify the course, and ultimately stop progression of this debilitating disease. Such approaches may also help development of parallel interventive strategies in other diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease, which share common traits and etiologies with PD. In this overview, we highlight near-term opportunities to apply P4 medicine principles for patients with PD and introduce the concept of composite orthogonal patient monitoring.",2023,Parkinson disease; cognitive impairment; debilitating disease; digital health; digital technology; disease control; economic burden; intervention; monitoring; neurodegenerative disorder; personalized medicine; symptom management; wearables,,"Khanna, A; Jones, G"

Detecting value(s): Digital biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and the valuation of new diagnostic technologies.,"This article explores how the meanings and values of diagnosis are being reconfigured at the interface between technological innovation and imaginaries of precision medicine. From genome sequencing to biological and digital 'markers' of disease, technological innovation occupies an increasingly central space in the way we imagine future health and illness. These imaginaries are usually centred on the promise of faster, more precise and personalised diagnosis, and the associated hope that if detected early enough disease can be effectively treated and prevented. Underpinning and reproduced through these narratives of the future is a re-conceptualisation of diagnostic processes and categories around the anticipation of future risk, as noted by recent theoretical developments in the sociology of diagnosis and related disciplines. Adding to this literature, in this article we explore what makes these emerging diagnostic arrangements valuable, to whom and how. Drawing on interviews with experts involved in the development of digital biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, we trace how multiple and at times conflicting applications of the tools, and the value(s) attached to them, are coproduced. We thus ask what possibilities are pursued, or foreclosed, through the work of imagining the future of diagnosis.",2024,diagnosis; digital health; risk; screening; surveillance medicine,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Inventions; Precision Medicine; Sociology,"Costa, A; Milne, R"

However, the degree to which vascular burden contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathological progression is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on both baseline tau tangle load and longitudinal tau accumulation. We included 1229 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 Study, including cognitively unimpaired and impaired participants with and without biomarker-confirmed amyloid-β pathology. All underwent baseline tau-PET (18F-RO948), and a subset (n = 677) underwent longitudinal tau-PET after 2.5 ± 1.0 years. Tau-PET uptake was computed for a temporal meta-region-of-interest. We focused on four main vascular imaging features and risk factors: microbleeds; white matter lesion volume; stroke-related events (infarcts, lacunes and haemorrhages); and the Framingham Heart Study Cardiovascular Disease risk score. To validate our in vivo results, we examined 1610 autopsy cases from an Arizona-based neuropathology cohort on three main vascular pathological features: cerebral amyloid angiopathy; white matter rarefaction; and infarcts. For the in vivo cohort, primary analyses included age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear mixed models between tau-PET (outcome) and interactions between time, amyloid-β and each vascular feature (predictors). For the neuropathology cohort, age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear models between tau tangle density (outcome) and an interaction between plaque density and each vascular feature (predictors) were performed. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we observed a significant interaction between microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology on greater baseline tau load (β = 0.68, P < 0.001) and longitudinal tau accumulation (β = 0.11, P < 0.001). For white matter lesion volume, we did not observe a significant independent interaction effect with amyloid-β on tau after accounting for microbleeds. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we further found that stroke-related events showed a significant negative interaction with amyloid-β on longitudinal tau (β = -0.08, P < 0.001). In cognitively impaired individuals, there were no significant interaction effects between cerebrovascular and amyloid-β pathology at all. In the neuropathology dataset, the in vivo observed interaction effects between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and plaque density (β = 0.38, P < 0.001) and between infarcts and plaque density (β = -0.11, P = 0.005) on tau tangle density were replicated. To conclude, we demonstrated that cerebrovascular pathology-in the presence of amyloid-β pathology-modifies tau accumulation in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, the co-occurrence of microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology was associated with greater accumulation of tau aggregates during early disease stages. This opens the possibility that interventions targeting microbleeds may attenuate the rate of tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; tau; vascular burden; vascular risk,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Stroke; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Plaque, Amyloid; Infarction; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Apolipoproteins E","Coomans, EM; van Westen, D; Binette, AP; Strandberg, O; Spotorno, N; Serrano, GE; Beach, TG; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Ossenkoppele, R; Hansson, O"
The efficacy and practicality of the Neurotrack Cognitive Battery assessment for utilization in clinical settings for the identification of cognitive decline in an older Japanese population.,"Japan has the largest aging population with 33% of the population over the age of 60 years. The number of Japanese adults with dementia is estimated to be approximately 4.6 million, comprising nearly 15% of the older adult population. It is critical to administer cognitive assessments early in the disease state that have high reliability and low user burden to detect negative cognitive changes as early as possible; however, current preclinical AD detection methods are invasive, time-consuming, and expensive. A number of traditional and digital cognitive assessments are also available, but many of these tests are time-consuming, taxing to the user, and not widely scalable. The purpose of this study was to incorporate a digital cognitive assessment battery into a standard clinical assessment performed within a Japanese-based neuropsychology clinic to assess the diagnostic accuracy and the relationship between the digital Neurotrack Cognitive Assessment Battery (N-CAB) to traditional cognitive assessments.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; Neurotrack; cognitive assessment; cognitive decline; dementia,,"Glenn, JM; Bryk, K; Myers, JR; Anderson, J; Onguchi, K; McFarlane, J; Ozaki, S"

Classification of Alzheimer's disease stages from magnetic resonance images using deep learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive type of dementia characterized by loss of memory and other cognitive abilities, including speech. Since AD is a progressive disease, detection in the early stages is essential for the appropriate care of the patient throughout its development, going from asymptomatic to a stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then progressing to dementia and severe dementia; is worth mentioning that everyone suffers from cognitive impairment to some degree as we age, but the relevant task here is to identify which people are most likely to develop AD. Along with cognitive tests, evaluation of the brain morphology is the primary tool for AD diagnosis, where atrophy and loss of volume of the frontotemporal lobe are common features in patients who suffer from the disease. Regarding medical imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are one of the methods used by specialists to assess brain morphology. Recently, with the rise of deep learning (DL) and its successful implementation in medical imaging applications, it is of growing interest in the research community to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems that can help physicians to detect this disease, especially in the early stages where macroscopic changes are not so easily identified. This article presents a DL-based approach to classifying MRI scans in the different stages of AD, using a curated set of images from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies databases. Our methodology involves image pre-processing using FreeSurfer, spatial data-augmentation operations, such as rotation, flip, and random zoom during training, and state-of-the-art 3D convolutional neural networks such as EfficientNet, DenseNet, and a custom siamese network, as well as the relatively new approach of vision transformer architecture. With this approach, the best detection percentage among all four architectures was around 89% for AD ",2023,Computer-aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Digital image processing; Supervised learning,,"Mora-Rubio, A; Bravo-Ortíz, MA; Quiñones Arredondo, S; Saborit Torres, JM; Ruz, GA; Tabares-Soto, R"
Assessing individual variability of the entorhinal subfields in health and disease.,"Investigating interindividual variability is a major field of interest in neuroscience. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is essential for memory and affected early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We combined histology ground-truth data with ultrahigh-resolution 7T ex vivo MRI to analyze EC interindividual variability in 3D. Further, we characterized (1) entorhinal shape as a whole, (2) entorhinal subfield range and midpoints, and (3) subfield architectural location and tau burden derived from 3D probability maps. Our results indicated that EC shape varied but was not related to demographic or disease factors at this preclinical stage. The medial intermediate subfield showed the highest degree of location variability in the probability maps. However, individual subfields did not display the same level of variability across dimensions and outcome measure, each providing a different perspective. For example, the olfactory subfield showed low variability in midpoint location in the superior-inferior dimension but high variability in anterior-posterior, and the subfield entorhinal intermediate showed a large variability in volumetric measures but a low variability in location derived from the 3D probability maps. These findings suggest that interindividual variability within the entorhinal subfields requires a 3D approach incorporating multiple outcome measures. This study provides 3D probability maps of the individual entorhinal subfields and respective tau pathology in the preclinical stage (Braak I and II) of AD. These probability maps illustrate the subfield average and may serve as a checkpoint for future modeling.",2023,MRI; histology; phosphorylated tau; three-dimensional; validation,Humans; Hippocampus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Entorhinal Cortex; Alzheimer Disease,"Oltmer, J; Greve, DN; Cerri, S; Slepneva, N; Llamas-Rodríguez, J; Iglesias, JE; Van Leemput, K; Champion, SN; Frosch, MP; Augustinack, JC"

The FNAME was administered to 257 participants across the clinical spectrum with 122 having amyloid biomarkers. Linear regression explored the association between demographics and FNAME and between amyloid (+/-) groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) identified performance thresholds that best discriminated between biomarker (+/-) individuals. Lower FNAME scores occurred in males, older ages, Black/African Americans, Hispanics, and biomarker-positive participants. ROC analyses demonstrated acceptable accuracy (0.73 to 0.77) but only when combined with clinical status. The diagnostic discrimination of amyloid positivity was acceptable but not excellent, suggesting the FNAME may be a better screening indicator of clinical status rather than amyloid deposition in cognitively normal individuals.

TIHM: An open dataset for remote healthcare monitoring in dementia.,"Dementia is a progressive condition that affects cognitive and functional abilities. There is a need for reliable and continuous health monitoring of People Living with Dementia (PLWD) to improve their quality of life and support their independent living. Healthcare services often focus on addressing and treating already established health conditions that affect PLWD. Managing these conditions continuously can inform better decision-making earlier for higher-quality care management for PLWD. The Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) project developed a new digital platform to routinely collect longitudinal, observational, and measurement data, within the home and apply machine learning and analytical models for the detection and prediction of adverse health events affecting the well-being of PLWD. This work describes the TIHM dataset collected during the second phase (i.e., feasibility study) of the TIHM project. The data was collected from homes of 56 PLWD and associated with events and clinical observations (daily activity, physiological monitoring, and labels for health-related conditions).

Dissociating memory and executive function impairment through temporal features in a word list verbal learning task.,"The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is an established verbal learning test commonly used to quantify memory impairments due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) both at a clinical dementia stage or prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Focal memory impairment-as quantified e.g. by the RAVLT-at an MCI stage is referred to as amnestic MCI (aMCI) and is often regarded as the cognitive phenotype of prodromal AD. However, recent findings suggest that not only learning and memory but also other cognitive domains, especially executive functions (EF) and processing speed (PS), influence verbal learning performance. This research investigates whether additional temporal features extracted from audio recordings from a participant's RAVLT response can better dissociate memory and EF in such tasks and eventually help to better describe MCI subtypes. 675 age-matched participants from the H70 Swedish birth cohort were included in this analysis; 68 participants were classified as MCI (33 aMCI and 35 due to executive impairment). RAVLT performances were recorded and temporal features extracted. Novel temporal features were correlated with established neuropsychological tests measuring EF and PS. Lastly, the downstream diagnostic potential of temporal features was estimated using group differences and a machine learning (ML) classification scenario. Temporal features correlated moderately with measures of EF and PS. Performance of an ML classifier could be improved by adding temporal features to traditional counts. We conclude that RAVLT temporal features are in general related to EF and that they might be capable of dissociating memory and EF in a word list learning task.",2023,Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; RAVLT; Speech analysis; Temporal analysis; aMCI; exMCI,,"Dörr, F; Schäfer, S; Öhman, F; Linz, N; Bodin, TH; Skoog, J; Zettergren, A; Kern, S; Skoog, I; Tröger, J"
A systematic review of clinical health conditions predicted by machine learning diagnostic and prognostic models trained or validated using real-world primary health care data.,"With the advances in technology and data science, machine learning (ML) is being rapidly adopted by the health care sector. However, there is a lack of literature addressing the health conditions targeted by the ML prediction models within primary health care (PHC) to date. To fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines to identify health conditions targeted by ML in PHC. We searched the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Elsevier, BioRxiv, Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and IEEE Xplore databases for studies published from January 1990 to January 2022. We included primary studies addressing ML diagnostic or prognostic predictive models that were supplied completely or partially by real-world PHC data. Studies selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using the prediction model study risk of bias assessment tool were performed by two investigators. Health conditions were categorized according to international classification of diseases (ICD-10). Extracted data were analyzed quantitatively. We identified 106 studies investigating 42 health conditions. These studies included 207 ML prediction models supplied by the PHC data of 24.2 million participants from 19 countries. We found that 92.4% of the studies were retrospective and 77.3% of the studies reported diagnostic predictive ML models. A majority (76.4%) of all the studies were for models' development without conducting external validation. Risk of bias assessment revealed that 90.8% of the studies were of high or unclear risk of bias. The most frequently reported health conditions were diabetes mellitus (19.8%) and Alzheimer's disease (11.3%). Our study provides a summary on the presently available ML prediction models within PHC.

A two-step workflow based on plasma p-tau217 to screen for amyloid β positivity with further confirmatory testing only in uncertain cases.,"Cost-effective strategies for identifying amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity in patients with cognitive impairment are urgently needed with recent approvals of anti-Aβ immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood biomarkers can accurately detect AD pathology, but it is unclear whether their incorporation into a full diagnostic workflow can reduce the number of confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) tests needed while accurately classifying patients. We evaluated a two-step workflow for determining Aβ-PET status in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from two independent memory clinic-based cohorts (n = 348). A blood-based model including plasma tau protein 217 (p-tau217), age and APOE ε4 status was developed in BioFINDER-1 (area under the curve (AUC) = 89.3%) and validated in BioFINDER-2 (AUC = 94.3%). In step 1, the blood-based model was used to stratify the patients into low, intermediate or high risk of Aβ-PET positivity. In step 2, we assumed referral only of intermediate-risk patients to CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 testing, whereas step 1 alone determined Aβ-status for low- and high-risk groups. Depending on whether lenient, moderate or stringent thresholds were used in step 1, the two-step workflow overall accuracy for detecting Aβ-PET status was 88.2%, 90.5% and 92.0%, respectively, while reducing the number of necessary CSF tests by 85.9%, 72.7% and 61.2%, respectively. In secondary analyses, an adapted version of the BioFINDER-1 model led to successful validation of the two-step workflow with a different plasma p-tau217 immunoassay in patients with cognitive impairment from the TRIAD cohort (n = 84). In conclusion, using a plasma p-tau217-based model for risk stratification of patients with MCI can substantially reduce the need for confirmatory testing while accurately classifying patients, offering a cost-effective strategy to detect AD in memory clinic settings.",2023,,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Workflow; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Blood Proteins; Alzheimer Disease","Brum, WS; Cullen, NC; Janelidze, S; Ashton, NJ; Zimmer, ER; Therriault, J; Benedet, AL; Rahmouni, N; Tissot, C; Stevenson, J; Servaes, S; Triana-Baltzer, G; Kolb, HC; Palmqvist, S; Stomrud, E; Rosa-Neto, P; Blennow, K; Hansson, O"

In Europe, over 14 million people are currently living with dementia, at a cost of over 400 billion EUR annually. Recent advances in diagnostics and approval for new pharmaceutical treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common etiology of dementia, heralds the beginning of precision medicine in this field. However, their implementation will challenge an already over-burdened healthcare systems. There is a need for innovative digital solutions that can drive the related clinical pathways and optimize and personalize care delivery. Public-private partnerships are ideal vehicles to tackle these challenges. Here we describe the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) public-private partnership project PROMINENT that has been initiated by connecting leading dementia researchers, medical professionals, dementia patients and their care partners with the latest innovative health technologies using a precision medicine based digital platform. The project builds upon the knowledge and already implemented digital tools from several collaborative initiatives that address new models for early detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. The project aims to provide support to improvement efforts to each aspect of the care pathway including diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and data collection for real world evidence and cost effectiveness studies. Ultimately the PROMINENT project is expected to lead to cost-effective care and improved health outcomes.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; clinical decision support; dementia; precision medicine,,"Tate, A; Suárez-Calvet, M; Ekelund, M; Eriksson, S; Eriksdotter, M; Van Der Flier, WM; Georges, J; Kivipelto, M; Kramberger, MG; Lindgren, P; López, JDG; Lötjönen, J; Persson, S; Pla, S; Solomon, A; Thurfjell, L; Wimo, A; Winblad, B; Jönsson, L"
Multilingual markers of depression in remotely collected speech samples: A preliminary analysis.,"Speech contains neuromuscular, physiological and cognitive components, and so is a potential biomarker of mental disorders. Previous studies indicate that speaking rate and pausing are associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, results are inconclusive as many studies are small and underpowered and do not include clinical samples. These studies have also been unilingual and use speech collected in controlled settings. If speech markers are to help understand the onset and progress of MDD, we need to uncover markers that are robust to language and establish the strength of associations in real-world data.",2023,Digital phenotypes; In-the-wild; Major depressive disorder; Speaking rate; Speech,"Humans; Speech; Depressive Disorder, Major; Depression; Language; Individuality","Cummins, N; Dineley, J; Conde, P; Matcham, F; Siddi, S; Lamers, F; Carr, E; Lavelle, G; Leightley, D; White, KM; Oetzmann, C; Campbell, EL; Simblett, S; Bruce, S; Haro, JM; Penninx, BWJH; Ranjan, Y; Rashid, Z; Stewart, C; Folarin, AA; Bailón, R; Schuller, BW; Wykes, T; Vairavan, S; Dobson, RJB; Narayan, VA; Hotopf, M"

Distinct Patterns of Hippocampal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease with Transactive Response DNA-binding Protein 43.,"Age-related dementia syndromes are often not related to a single pathophysiological process, leading to multiple neuropathologies found at autopsy. An amnestic dementia syndrome can be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with comorbid transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology (AD/TDP). Here, we investigated neuronal integrity and pathological burden of TDP-43 and tau, along the well-charted trisynaptic hippocampal circuit (dentate gyrus [DG], CA3, and CA1) in participants with amnestic dementia due to AD/TDP, amnestic dementia due to AD alone, or non-amnestic dementia due to TDP-43 proteinopathy associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP).",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Frontotemporal Dementia; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Hippocampus; DNA-Binding Proteins; tau Proteins,"Minogue, G; Kawles, A; Zouridakis, A; Keszycki, R; Macomber, A; Lubbat, V; Gill, N; Mao, Q; Flanagan, ME; Zhang, H; Castellani, R; Bigio, EH; Mesulam, MM; Geula, C; Gefen, T"
Reduced body cell mass and functions in lower extremities are associated with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia.,"This study examined the alterations of segmental body composition in individuals with Alzheimer's pathology (AD), including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. A multifrequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA) was used to provide segmental water and impedance variables from 365 cognitively normal (CN), 123 MCI due to AD, and 30 AD dementia participants. We compared the BIA variables between the three groups, examined their correlations with neuropsychological screening test scores, and illustrate their 95% confidence RXc graphs. AD dementia participants were older, more depressive, and had worse cognitive abilities than MCI due to AD and CN participants. Although the BIA variables showed weak partial correlations with the cognitive test scores, we found patterns of an increasing water content in lean mass, increasing extra to intracellular water ratio, and decreasing reactance and phase angle in the lower extremities with effect sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.51 in the groups of MCI and dementia due to AD compared with CN individuals. The RXc graphs upheld the findings with a significant displacement downward and toward the right, dominantly in the lower extremities. Individuals with AD pathology exhibit a reduced body cell mass or cell strength, an abnormal cellular water distribution, and an overhydration status in lean mass, especially in the lower extremities.",2023,,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Lower Extremity; Cognition; Water,"Doan, DNT; Kim, K; Ku, B; Lee, KH; Kim, JU"
Anti-amyloid: An antibody to cure Alzheimer's or an attitude.,"For more than a century, clinicians have been aware of the devastating neurological condition called Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized by the presence of abnormal amyloid protein plaques and tau tangles in the brain. The dominant hypothesis, termed the amyloid hypothesis, attributes AD development to excessive cleavage and accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to brain tissue atrophy. The amyloid hypothesis has greatly influenced AD research and therapeutic endeavors. However, despite significant attention, a complete understanding of amyloid and APP's roles in disease pathology, progression, and cognitive impairment remains elusive. Recent controversies and several unsuccessful drug trials have called into question whether amyloid is the only neuropathological factor for treatment. To accomplish disease amelioration, we argue that researchers and clinicians may need to take a compounding approach to target amyloid and other factors in the brain, including traditional pharmaceuticals and holistic therapies.",2023,Health sciences; Medicine; Neurology; Pharmacology; Psychiatry,,"Osborne, OM; Naranjo, O; Heckmann, BL; Dykxhoorn, D; Toborek, M"

European Projects for Patients with Dementia and Their Caregivers.,"As we all know there is no treatment that can stop or delay the progression of dementia. The treatment we use is only symptomatic. EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) recommendations for dementia prevention by Sorbi et al. (2012) concluded that there is no treatment, no lifestyle, which could have an effect on prevention or delay of onset of different forms of dementia until today. The future studies in prevention must recruit younger people, larger sample, and for longer period. The last 10 years we have run, in collaboration with organizations in different European countries, many projects in order to support patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly patients with dementia and their caregivers. The first project was a 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe: predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS (Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe) study, an FP5 project with 1380 patients. Five studies were published. The second project was DESCRIPA study, an FP5 project to DEvelopment of Screening guidelines and clinical CRIteria for Predementia Alzheimer's disease, with 881 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). LLM (Long Lasting Memories) and VRADA (A virtual reality application for the exercise of dementia and Alzheimer patients) are two projects that include body and cognitive exercise for health for the elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment. The next is the RECAGE (REspectful Caring for the AGitated Elderly) project (Horizon 2020), a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. With six European universities we finished a very interesting FP6 project, the AddNeuroMed one, which gives even now information about the progression of normal elderly MCI and AD patients, in collaboration with other consortia. A very interesting Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project about digital biomarkers was entitled Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR project). The main goal of this project was the development and validation of technology-enabled, quantitative and sensitive measures of functional decline in people with early-stage AD. A running project is an Erasmus+ one in the higher education field, ""Genetic counseling in European universities: The case of neurodegenerative diseases"" (GECONEU project). The target of this study is to develop an online course for university students focusing on genetic counseling, and support people and society to better understand the aims of genetic testing and the usefulness of genetic counseling by involving students in an innovative learning and teaching setting. AD-gaming, BRIDGE, iCONNECT (Intergenerational CONtact between studeNts and people with dEmentia through CreaTive education), E.L.So.M.C.I (English Lessons with the Use of Songs for People with Mild Cognitive Impairment), Games4CoSkills, and De-Sign are all Erasmus+ projects that aim to improve the quality of life of patients with MCI or dementia.

Challenges in Using mHealth Data From Smartphones and Wearable Devices to Predict Depression Symptom Severity: Retrospective Analysis.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects millions of people worldwide, but timely treatment is not often received owing in part to inaccurate subjective recall and variability in the symptom course. Objective and frequent MDD monitoring can improve subjective recall and help to guide treatment selection. Attempts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to explore the relationship between the measures of depression and passive digital phenotypes (features) extracted from smartphones and wearables devices to remotely and continuously monitor changes in symptomatology. However, a number of challenges exist for the analysis of these data. These include maintaining participant engagement over extended time periods and therefore understanding what constitutes an acceptable threshold of missing data; distinguishing between the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships for different features to determine their utility in tracking within-individual longitudinal variation or screening individuals at high risk; and understanding the heterogeneity with which depression manifests itself in behavioral patterns quantified by the passive features.",2023,behavioral patterns; depression; digital phenotypes; missing data; mobile health; mobile phone; smartphones; wearable devices,"Humans; Smartphone; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Retrospective Studies; Telemedicine; Wearable Electronic Devices","Sun, S; Folarin, AA; Zhang, Y; Cummins, N; Garcia-Dias, R; Stewart, C; Ranjan, Y; Rashid, Z; Conde, P; Laiou, P; Sankesara, H; Matcham, F; Leightley, D; White, KM; Oetzmann, C; Ivan, A; Lamers, F; Siddi, S; Simblett, S; Nica, R; Rintala, A; Mohr, DC; Myin-Germeys, I; Wykes, T; Haro, JM; Penninx, BWJH; Vairavan, S; Narayan, VA; Annas, P; Hotopf, M; Dobson, RJB"

Methods to Discover and Validate Biofluid-Based Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Dementias.,"Neurodegenerative dementias are progressive diseases that cause neuronal network breakdown in different brain regions often because of accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain extracellular matrix, such as amyloids or inside neurons or other cell types of the brain. Several diagnostic protein biomarkers in body fluids are being used and implemented, such as for Alzheimer's disease. However, there is still a lack of biomarkers for co-pathologies and other causes of dementia. Such biofluid-based biomarkers enable precision medicine approaches for diagnosis and treatment, allow to learn more about underlying disease processes, and facilitate the development of patient inclusion and evaluation tools in clinical trials. When designing studies to discover novel biofluid-based biomarkers, choice of technology is an important starting point. But there are so many technologies to choose among. To address this, we here review the technologies that are currently available in research settings and, in some cases, in clinical laboratory practice.

STRIDE: Systematic Radar Intelligence Analysis for ADRD Risk Evaluation with Gait Signature Simulation and Deep Learning.,"Abnormal gait is a significant non-cognitive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). Micro-Doppler radar, a non-wearable technology, can capture human gait movements for potential early ADRD risk assessment. In this research, we propose to design STRIDE integrating micro-Doppler radar sensors with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. STRIDE embeds a new deep learning (DL) classification framework. As a proof of concept, we develop a ""digital-twin"" of STRIDE, consisting of a human walking simulation model and a micro-Doppler radar simulation model, to generate a gait signature dataset. Taking established human walking parameters, the walking model simulates individuals with ADRD under various conditions. The radar model based on electromagnetic scattering and the Doppler frequency shift model is employed to generate micro-Doppler signatures from different moving body parts (e.g., foot, limb, joint, torso, shoulder, etc.). A band-dependent DL framework is developed to predict ADRD risks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of STRIDE for evaluating ADRD risk.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia; Deep learning; gait analysis; micro-Doppler radar,,"Cai, F; Patharkar, A; Wu, T; Lure, FYM; Chen, H; Chen, VC"
Full-Spectrum Neuronal Diversity and Stereotypy through Whole Brain Morphometry.,"We conducted a large-scale study of whole-brain morphometry, analyzing 3.7 peta-voxels of mouse brain images at the single-cell resolution, producing one of the largest multi-morphometry databases of mammalian brains to date. We spatially registered 205 mouse brains and associated data from six Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) data sources covering three major imaging modalities from five collaborative projects to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) atlas, annotated 3D locations of cell bodies of 227,581 neurons, modeled 15,441 dendritic microenvironments, characterized the full morphology of 1,891 neurons along with their axonal motifs, and detected 2.58 million putative synaptic boutons. Our analysis covers six levels of information related to neuronal populations, dendritic microenvironments, single-cell full morphology, sub-neuronal dendritic and axonal arborization, axonal boutons, and structural motifs, along with a quantitative characterization of the diversity and stereotypy of patterns at each level. We identified 16 modules consisting of highly intercorrelated brain regions in 13 functional brain areas corresponding to 314 anatomical regions in CCF. Our analysis revealed the dendritic microenvironment as a powerful method for delineating brain regions of cell types and potential subtypes. We also found that full neuronal morphologies can be categorized into four distinct classes based on spatially tuned morphological features, with substantial cross-areal diversity in apical dendrites, basal dendrites, and axonal arbors, along with quantified stereotypy within cortical, thalamic and striatal regions. The lamination of somas was found to be more effective in differentiating neuron arbors within the cortex. Further analysis of diverging and converging projections of individual neurons in 25 regions throughout the brain reveals branching preferences in the brain-wide and local distributions of axonal boutons. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive description of key anatomical structures of neurons and their types, covering a wide range of scales and features, and contributes to our understanding of neuronal diversity and its function in the mammalian brain.",2023,,,"Liu, Y; Jiang, S; Li, Y; Zhao, S; Yun, Z; Zhao, ZH; Zhang, L; Wang, G; Chen, X; Manubens-Gil, L; Hang, Y; Garcia-Forn, M; Wang, W; Rubeis, S; Wu, Z; Osten, P; Gong, H; Hawrylycz, M; Mitra, P; Dong, H; Luo, Q; Ascoli, GA; Zeng, H; Liu, L; Peng, H"
Data sharing in neurodegenerative disease research: challenges and learnings from the innovative medicines initiative public-private partnership model.,"Efficient data sharing is hampered by an array of organizational, ethical, behavioral, and technical challenges, slowing research progress and reducing the utility of data generated by clinical research studies on neurodegenerative diseases. There is a particular need to address differences between public and private sector environments for research and data sharing, which have varying standards, expectations, motivations, and interests. The Neuronet data sharing Working Group was set up to understand the existing barriers to data sharing in public-private partnership projects, and to provide guidance to overcome these barriers, by convening data sharing experts from diverse projects in the IMI neurodegeneration portfolio. In this policy and practice review, we outline the challenges and learnings of the WG, providing the neurodegeneration community with examples of good practices and recommendations on how to overcome obstacles to data sharing. These obstacles span organizational issues linked to the unique structure of cross-sectoral, collaborative research initiatives, to technical issues that affect the storage, structure and annotations of individual datasets. We also identify sociotechnical hurdles, such as academic recognition and reward systems that disincentivise data sharing, and legal challenges linked to heightened perceptions of data privacy risk, compounded by a lack of clear guidance on GDPR compliance mechanisms for public-private research. Focusing on real-world, neuroimaging and digital biomarker data, we highlight particular challenges and learnings for data sharing, such as data management planning, development of ethical codes of conduct, and harmonization of protocols and curation processes.

Capturing Measures That Matter: The Potential Value of Digital Measures of Physical Behavior for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of dementia worldwide. Despite the magnitude of AD's impact on patients, caregivers, and society, nearly all AD clinical trials fail. A potential contributor to this high rate of failure is that established clinical outcome assessments fail to capture subtle clinical changes, entail high burden for patients and their caregivers, and ineffectively address the aspects of health deemed important by patients and their caregivers. AD progression is associated with widespread changes in physical behavior that have impacts on the ability to function independently, which is a meaningful aspect of health for patients with AD and important for diagnosis. However, established assessments of functional independence remain underutilized in AD clinical trials and are limited by subjective biases and ceiling effects. Digital measures of real-world physical behavior assessed passively, continuously, and remotely using digital health technologies have the potential to address some of these limitations and to capture aspects of functional independence in patients with AD. In particular, measures of real-world gait, physical activity, and life-space mobility captured with wearable sensors may offer value. Additional research is needed to understand the validity, feasibility, and acceptability of these measures in AD clinical research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; digital measure; drug development; gait; life-space mobility; meaningful aspect of health; physical behavior; physical function; wearable sensor,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Caregivers; Drug Development,"Bachman, SL; Blankenship, JM; Busa, M; Serviente, C; Lyden, K; Clay, I"

PFP-HOG: Pyramid and Fixed-Size Patch-Based HOG Technique for Automated Brain Abnormality Classification with MRI.,"Detecting neurological abnormalities such as brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images is an important research topic in the literature. Numerous machine learning models have been used to detect brain abnormalities accurately. This study addresses the problem of detecting neurological abnormalities in MRI. The motivation behind this problem lies in the need for accurate and efficient methods to assist neurologists in the diagnosis of these disorders. In addition, many deep learning techniques have been applied to MRI to develop accurate brain abnormality detection models, but these networks have high time complexity. Hence, a novel hand-modeled feature-based learning network is presented to reduce the time complexity and obtain high classification performance. The model proposed in this work uses a new feature generation architecture named pyramid and fixed-size patch (PFP). The main aim of the proposed PFP structure is to attain high classification performance using essential feature extractors with both multilevel and local features. Furthermore, the PFP feature extractor generates low- and high-level features using a handcrafted extractor. To obtain the high discriminative feature extraction ability of the PFP, we have used histogram-oriented gradients (HOG); hence, it is named PFP-HOG. Furthermore, the iterative Chi2 (IChi2) is utilized to choose the clinically significant features. Finally, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) with tenfold cross-validation is used for automated classification. Four MRI neurological databases (AD dataset, brain tumor dataset 1, brain tumor dataset 2, and merged dataset) have been utilized to develop our model. PFP-HOG and IChi2-based models attained 100%, 94.98%, 98.19%, and 97.80% using the AD dataset, brain tumor dataset1, brain tumor dataset 2, and merged brain MRI dataset, respectively. These findings not only provide an accurate and robust classification of various neurological disorders using MRI but also hold the potential to assist neurologists in validating manual MRI brain abnormality screening.",2023,Biomedical image processing; Brain MRI; Computer vision; HOG; Pyramid and fixed-size patch feature extraction,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Alzheimer Disease,"Kaplan, E; Chan, WY; Altinsoy, HB; Baygin, M; Barua, PD; Chakraborty, S; Dogan, S; Tuncer, T; Acharya, UR"
Presymptomatic and early pathological features of MAPT-associated frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"Early pathological features of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) due to MAPT pathogenic variants (FTLD-MAPT) are understudied, since early-stage tissue is rarely available. Here, we report unique pathological data from three presymptomatic/early-stage MAPT variant carriers (FTLD Clinical Dementia Rating [FTLD-CDR] = 0-1). We examined neuronal degeneration semi-quantitatively and digitally quantified tau burden in 18 grey matter (9 cortical, 9 subcortical) and 13 white matter (9 cortical, 4 subcortical) regions. We compared presymptomatic/early-stage pathology to an intermediate/end-stage cohort (FTLD-CDR = 2-3) with the same variants (2 L315R, 10 P301L, 6 G272V), and developed a clinicopathological staging model for P301L and G272V variants. The 68-year-old presymptomatic L315R carrier (FTLD-CDR = 0) had limited tau burden morphologically similar to L315R end-stage carriers in middle frontal, antero-inferior temporal, amygdala, (para-)hippocampus and striatum, along with age-related Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change. The 59-year-old prodromal P301L carrier (FTLD-CDR = 0.5) had highest tau burden in anterior cingulate, anterior temporal, middle/superior frontal, and fronto-insular cortex, and amygdala. The 45-year-old early-stage G272V carrier (FTLD-CDR = 1) had highest tau burden in superior frontal and anterior cingulate cortex, subiculum and CA1. The severity and distribution of tau burden showed some regional variability between variants at presymptomatic/early-stage, while neuronal degeneration, mild-to-moderate, was similarly distributed in frontotemporal regions. Early-stage tau burden and neuronal degeneration were both less severe than in intermediate-/end-stage cases. In a subset of regions (10 GM, 8 WM) used for clinicopathological staging, clinical severity correlated strongly with neuronal degeneration (rho = 0.72, p < 0.001), less strongly with GM tau burden (rho = 0.57, p = 0.006), and did not with WM tau burden (p = 0.9). Clinicopathological staging showed variant-specific patterns of early tau pathology and progression across stages. These unique data demonstrate that tau pathology and neuronal degeneration are present already at the presymptomatic/early-stage of FTLD-MAPT, though less severely compared to intermediate/end-stage disease. Moreover, early pathological patterns, especially of tau burden, differ partly between specific MAPT variants.",2023,Early pathology; Frontotemporal lobar degeneration; MAPT gene; Neuronal degeneration; Tau burden,Humans; Aged; Middle Aged; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Frontotemporal Dementia; tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Gray Matter; Gyrus Cinguli,"Giannini, LA; Mol, MO; Rajicic, A; van Buuren, R; Sarkar, L; Arezoumandan, S; Ohm, DT; Irwin, DJ; Rozemuller, AJ; van Swieten, JC; Seelaar, H"

Exploratory Longitudinal Study of Ocular Structural and Visual Functional Changes in Subjects at High Genetic Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease.,"This study aimed to analyze the evolution of visual changes in cognitively healthy individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants with a first-degree family history of AD (FH+) and carrying the Ε4+ allele for the ApoE gene (ApoE ε4+) underwent retinal thickness analysis using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual function assessments, including visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), color perception, perception digital tests, and visual field analysis. Structural analysis divided participants into FH+ ApoE ε4+ and FH- ApoE ε4- groups, while functional analysis further categorized them by age (40-60 years and over 60 years). Over the 27-month follow-up, the FH+ ApoE ε4+ group exhibited thickness changes in all inner retinal layers. Comparing this group to the FH- ApoE ε4- group at 27 months revealed progressing changes in the inner nuclear layer. In the FH+ ApoE ε4+ 40-60 years group, no progression of visual function changes was observed, but an increase in VA and CS was maintained at 3 and 12 cycles per degree, respectively, compared to the group without AD risk at 27 months. In conclusion, cognitively healthy individuals at risk for AD demonstrated progressive retinal structural changes over the 27-month follow-up, while functional changes remained stable.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; ApoE ε4; contrast sensitivity; familiar history; genetic risk; optical coherence tomography; visual acuity,,"López-Cuenca, I; Sánchez-Puebla, L; Salobrar-García, E; Álvarez-Gutierrez, M; Elvira-Hurtado, L; Barabash, A; Ramírez-Toraño, F; Fernández-Albarral, JA; Matamoros, JA; Nebreda, A; García-Colomo, A; Ramírez, AI; Salazar, JJ; Gil, P; Maestú, F; Ramírez, JM; de Hoz, R"

Exploitation of Quercetin's Antioxidative Properties in Potential Alternative Therapeutic Options for Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Oxidative stress (OS) is a condition in which there is an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body, which can lead to cell and tissue damage. This occurs when there is an overproduction of ROS or when the body's antioxidant defense systems are overwhelmed. Quercetin (Que) is part of a group of compounds called flavonoids. It is found in high concentrations in vegetables, fruits, and other foods. Over the past decade, a growing number of studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of flavonoids to modulate neuronal function and prevent age-related neurodegeneration. Therefore, Que has been shown to have antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties, both in vitro and in vivo. Due to its antioxidant character, Que alleviates oxidative stress, thus improving cognitive function, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, Que can also help support the body's natural antioxidant defense systems, thus being a potentially practical supplement for managing OS. This review focuses on experimental studies supporting the neuroprotective effects of Que in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and epilepsy.",2023,neurodegenerative diseases; neuroprotective effects; oxidative stress; quercetin,,"Rarinca, V; Nicoara, MN; Ureche, D; Ciobica, A"
Spatial cognition is associated with levels of phosphorylated-tau and β-amyloid in clinically normal older adults.,Spatial cognition is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the symptomatic stages of the disease. We investigated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (phosphorylated-tau [p-tau] and β-amyloid) are associated with poorer spatial cognition in clinically normal older adults.

Speech and language markers of neurodegeneration: a call for global equity.,"In the field of neurodegeneration, speech and language assessments are useful for diagnosing aphasic syndromes and for characterizing other disorders. As a complement to classic tests, scalable and low-cost digital tools can capture relevant anomalies automatically, potentially supporting the quest for globally equitable markers of brain health. However, this promise remains unfulfilled due to limited linguistic diversity in scientific works and clinical instruments. Here we argue for cross-linguistic research as a core strategy to counter this problem. First, we survey the contributions of linguistic assessments in the study of primary progressive aphasia and the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Second, we address two forms of linguistic unfairness in the literature: the neglect of most of the world's 7000 languages and the preponderance of English-speaking cohorts. Third, we review studies showing that linguistic dysfunctions in a given disorder may vary depending on the patient's language and that English speakers offer a suboptimal benchmark for other language groups. Finally, we highlight different approaches, tools and initiatives for cross-linguistic research, identifying core challenges for their deployment. Overall, we seek to inspire timely actions to counter a looming source of inequity in behavioural neurology.",2023,cross-linguistic research; language diversity; linguistic testing; neurodegenerative diseases,Humans; Speech; Language; Aphasia; Linguistics; Alzheimer Disease,"García, AM; de Leon, J; Tee, BL; Blasi, DE; Gorno-Tempini, ML"

The roles of natural triterpenoid saponins against Alzheimer's disease.,"The aging of the world population and increasing stress levels in life are the major cause of the increased incidence of neurological disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) creates a huge burden on the lives and health of individuals and has become a big concern for society. Triterpenoid saponins (TS), representative natural product components, have a wide range of pharmacological bioactivities such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation, antiapoptosis, hormone-like, and gut microbiota regulation. Notably, some natural TS exhibited promising neuroprotective activity that can intervene in AD progress, especially in the early stage. Recently, studies have indicated that TS play a pronounced positive role in the prevention and treatment of AD. This review discusses the recent research on the neuroprotection of TS and proceeds to detail the action mechanisms of TS against AD, hoping to provide a reference for drug development for anti-AD.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; action mechanism; neuroprotection; triterpenoid saponins,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Antioxidants; Neuroprotection; Saponins; Triterpenes,"Zhou, JC; Li, HL; Zhou, Y; Li, XT; Yang, ZY; Tohda, C; Komatsu, K; Piao, XH; Ge, YW"
Using Biomarkers for Cognitive Enhancement and Evaluation in Mobile Applications.,"Clinicians are increasingly using biomarkers to diagnose and monitor cognitive conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Biomarkers are classified into two main categories based on their clinical goal: disease-associated biomarkers and drug-related biomarkers. In the case of disease-associated biomarkers, neuroimaging biomarkers are used to predict and validate Alzheimer's disease at any of its stages including mild cognitive impairment. The use of mobile and wearable devices to collect data about a person's daily activities and behaviors has led to the emergence of a new type of biomarker known as digital biomarkers. This type of data provides a digital reflection of a person's function in the context of everyday life and can be used to monitor and track changes in an individual's health and behaviors over time. The use of biomarkers in mobile applications for cognitive enhancement and evaluation can provide valuable insights into an individual's cognitive health and can help to optimize treatment and prevention strategies.",2023,Biomarkers; Cognitive enhancement; Digital biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Mobile Applications; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Cognition; Disease Progression; Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Giannopoulou, P; Vlamos, P"
Making Pre-screening for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Postoperative Delirium Among Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) a National Priority: The Deep Neuro Study.,"SARS-CoV-2 effects on cognition are a vibrant area of active research. Many researchers suggest that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms leading to hospitalization sustain significant neurodegenerative injury, such as encephalopathy and poor discharge disposition. However, despite some post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) case series that have described elevated neurodegenerative biomarkers, no studies have been identified that directly compared levels to those in mild cognitive impairment, non-PACS postoperative delirium patients after major non-emergent surgery, or preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients that have clinical evidence of Alzheimer's without symptoms. According to recent estimates, there may be 416 million people globally on the AD continuum, which include approximately 315 million people with preclinical AD. In light of all the above, a more effective application of digital biomarker and explainable artificial intelligence methodologies that explored amyloid beta, neuronal, axonal, and glial markers in relation to neurological complications in-hospital or later outcomes could significantly assist progress in the field. Easy and scalable subjects' risk stratification is of utmost importance, yet current international collaboration initiatives are still challenging due to the limited explainability and accuracy to identify individuals at risk or in the earliest stages that might be candidates for future clinical trials. In this open letter, we propose the administration of selected digital biomarkers previously discovered and validated in other EU-funded studies to become a routine assessment for non-PACS preoperative cognitive impairment, PACS neurological complications in-hospital, or later PACS and non-PACS improvement in cognition after surgery. The open letter also includes an economic analysis of the implications for such national-level initiatives. Similar collaboration initiatives could have existing pre-diagnostic detection and progression prediction solutions pre-screen the stage before and around diagnosis, enabling new disease manifestation mapping and pushing the field into unchartered territory.",2023,Artificial intelligence; Digital biomarkers; Genetics; National priority projects,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Artificial Intelligence; Emergence Delirium; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers,"Tarnanas, I; Tsolaki, M"

Advance Care Planning in the Netherlands.,"The Dutch health care system fosters a strong public health sector offering accessible generalist care including generalist palliative care. General practitioners are well positioned to conduct ACP, for example, to continue or initiate conversations after hospitalization. However, research shows that ACP conversations are often ad hoc and in frail patients, ACP is often only initiated when admitted to a nursing home by elderly care physicians who are on the staff. Tools that raise awareness of triggers to initiate ACP, screening tools, information brochures, checklists and training have been developed and implemented with funding by national programs which currently focus on implementation projects rather than or in addition to, research. The programs commonly require educational deliverables, patient and public involvement and addressing diversity in patient groups. A major challenge is how to implement ACP systematically and continuously across sectors and disciplines in a way that supports a proactive yet person-centered approach rather than an approach with an exclusive focus on medical procedures. Digital solutions can support continuity of care and communication about care plans. Solutions should fit a culture that prefers trust-based, informal deliberative approaches. This may be supported by involving disciplines other than medicine, such as nursing and spiritual caregiving, and public health approaches.",2023,Advance Care Planning; Disease progression; Ganzheitliche Medizin; Gesundheitsversorgung; Healthcare delivery; Holistic medicine; Krankheitsprogression; Palliative care; Palliativversorgung; Partizipative Entscheidungsfindung; Shared decision-making; Social context; Sozialer Kontext; Vorausschauende Gesundheitsplanung,Humans; Netherlands; Germany; Advance Care Planning; Nursing Homes; Palliative Care,"van der Steen, JT; Engels, Y; Touwen, DP; Kars, MC; Reyners, AKL; van der Linden, YM; Korfage, IJ"

To help advance understanding of ANS' role in dementia, we draw upon aging and dementia-related literature, and propose a framework that centers on the role of ANS flexibility to guide future work on application of ANS function to differentiating the degree and type of dementia-related brain pathologies. We first provide a brief review of literature within the past 10 years on ANS and dementia-related brain pathologies. Next, we present an ANS flexibility model, describing how the model can be applied to understand these brain pathologies, as well as differentiate or even be leveraged to modify typical brain aging and dementia.

Reduced slow-wave activity and autonomic dysfunction during sleep precede cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.,"Occurrence of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation in brain begins before the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as preclinical AD. Studies have reported that sleep problems and autonomic dysfunction associate closely with AD. However, whether they, especially the interaction between sleep and autonomic function, play critical roles in preclinical AD are unclear. Therefore, we investigated how sleep patterns and autonomic regulation at different sleep-wake stages changed and whether they were related to cognitive performance in pathogenesis of AD mice. Polysomnographic recordings in freely-moving APP/PS1 and wild-type (WT) littermates were collected to study sleep patterns and autonomic function at 4 (early disease stage) and 8 months of age (advanced disease stage), cognitive tasks including novel object recognition and Morris water maze were performed, and Aβ levels in brain were measured. APP/PS1 mice at early stage of AD pathology with Aβ aggregation but without significant differences in cognitive performance had frequent sleep-wake transitions, lower sleep-related delta power percentage, lower overall autonomic activity, and lower parasympathetic activity mainly during sleep compared with WT mice. The same phenomenon was observed in advanced-stage APP/PS1 mice with significant cognitive deficits. In mice at both disease stages, sleep-related delta power percentage correlated positively with memory performance. At early stage, memory performance correlated positively with sympathetic activity during wakefulness; at advanced stage, memory performance correlated positively with parasympathetic activity during both wakefulness and sleep. In conclusion, sleep quality and distinction between wake- and sleep-related autonomic function may be biomarkers for early AD detection.",2023,,"Mice; Animals; Mice, Transgenic; Alzheimer Disease; Primary Dysautonomias; Sleep; Cognition; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Chen, CW; Kwok, YT; Cheng, YT; Huang, YS; Kuo, TBJ; Wu, CH; Du, PJ; Yang, AC; Yang, CCH"

Resting-state EEG signatures of Alzheimer's disease are driven by periodic but not aperiodic changes.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasise the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",2023,,,"Kopčanová, M; Tait, L; Donoghue, T; Stothart, G; Smith, L; Sandoval, AAF; Davila-Perez, P; Buss, S; Shafi, MM; Pascual-Leone, A; Fried, PJ; Benwell, CSY"
The impact of regional heterogeneity in whole-brain dynamics in the presence of oscillations.,"Large variability exists across brain regions in health and disease, considering their cellular and molecular composition, connectivity, and function. Large-scale whole-brain models comprising coupled brain regions provide insights into the underlying dynamics that shape complex patterns of spontaneous brain activity. In particular, biophysically grounded mean-field whole-brain models in the asynchronous regime were used to demonstrate the dynamical consequences of including regional variability. Nevertheless, the role of heterogeneities when brain dynamics are supported by synchronous oscillating state, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon in brain, remains poorly understood. Here, we implemented two models capable of presenting oscillatory behavior with different levels of abstraction: a phenomenological Stuart-Landau model and an exact mean-field model. The fit of these models informed by structural- to functional-weighted MRI signal (T1w/T2w) allowed us to explore the implication of the inclusion of heterogeneities for modeling resting-state fMRI recordings from healthy participants. We found that disease-specific regional functional heterogeneity imposed dynamical consequences within the oscillatory regime in fMRI recordings from neurodegeneration with specific impacts on brain atrophy/structure (Alzheimer's patients). Overall, we found that models with oscillations perform better when structural and functional regional heterogeneities are considered, showing that phenomenological and biophysical models behave similarly at the brink of the Hopf bifurcation.",2023,Exact mean-field model; Hopf bifurcation; Neuroimaging; Regional heterogeneity; Whole-brain model,,"Perl, YS; Zamora-Lopez, G; Montbrió, E; Monge-Asensio, M; Vohryzek, J; Fittipaldi, S; Campo, CG; Moguilner, S; Ibañez, A; Tagliazucchi, E; Yeo, BTT; Kringelbach, ML; Deco, G"

Characterization of hippocampal sclerosis of aging and its association with other neuropathologic changes and cognitive deficits in the oldest-old.,"Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-A) is a common age-related neuropathological lesion characterized by neuronal loss and astrogliosis in subiculum and CA1 subfield of hippocampus. HS-A is associated with cognitive decline that mimics Alzheimer's disease. Pathological diagnosis of HS-A is traditionally binary based on presence/absence of the lesion. We compared this traditional measure against our novel quantitative measure for studying the relationship between HS-A and other neuropathologies and cognitive impairment. We included 409 participants from The 90+ study with neuropathological examination and longitudinal neuropsychological assessments. In those with HS-A, we examined digitized H&E and LFB stained hippocampal slides. The length of HS-A in each subfield of hippocampus and subiculum, each further divided into three subregions, was measured using Aperio eSlide Manager. For each subregion, the proportion affected by HS-A was calculated. Using regression models, both traditional/binary and quantitative measures were used to study the relationship between HS-A and other neuropathological changes and cognitive outcomes. HS-A was present in 48 (12%) of participants and was always focal, primarily affecting CA1 (73%), followed by subiculum (9%); overlapping pathology (subiculum and CA1) affected 18% of individuals. HS-A was more common in the left (82%) than the right (25%) hemisphere and was bilateral in 7% of participants. HS-A traditional/binary assessment was associated with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC; OR = 3.45, p < 0.001) and aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG; OR = 2.72, p = 0.008). In contrast, our quantitative approach showed associations between the proportion of HS-A (CA1/subiculum/combined) and LATE-NC (p = 0.001) and arteriolosclerosis (p = 0.005). While traditional binary assessment of HS-A was associated with impaired memory (OR = 2.60, p = 0.007), calculations (OR = 2.16, p = 0.027), and orientation (OR = 3.56, p < 0.001), our quantitative approach revealed additional associations with impairments in language (OR = 1.33, p = 0.018) and visuospatial domains (OR = 1.37, p = 0.006). Our novel quantitative method revealed associations between HS-A and vascular pathologies and impairment in cognitive domains that were not detected using traditional/binary measures.",2023,Arteriolosclerosis; Cognitive impairment; Hippocampal subfields; LATE-NC; Oldest-old; Quantification,"Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Aging; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Hippocampal Sclerosis; Hippocampus; Logistic Models; Neuropathology","Sordo, L; Qian, T; Bukhari, SA; Nguyen, KM; Woodworth, DC; Head, E; Kawas, CH; Corrada, MM; Montine, TJ; Sajjadi, SA"
Activation of Gq-Coupled Receptors in Astrocytes Restores Cognitive Function in Alzheimer's Disease Mice Model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases. Most of the current AD therapeutic developments are directed towards improving neuronal cell function or facilitating Aβ amyloid clearance from the brain. However, some recent evidence suggests that astrocytes may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of the optogenetic activation of Gq-coupled exogenous receptors expressed in astrocytes as a possible way of restoring brain function in the AD mouse model. We evaluated the effects of the optogenetic activation of astrocytes on long-term potentiation, spinal morphology and behavioral readouts in 5xFAD mouse model of AD. We determined that in vivo chronic activation of astrocytes resulted in the preservation of spine density, increased mushroom spine survival, and improved performance in cognitive behavioral tests. Furthermore, chronic optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes resulted in the elevation of EAAT-2 glutamate uptake transporter expression, which could be a possible explanation for the observed in vivo neuroprotective effects. The obtained results suggest that the persistent activation of astrocytes may be considered a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; EAAT-2; Gq-coupled proteins; astrocytes; behavioral tests; long-term potentiation; opto-α1-adrenoreceptor; optogenetics,"Mice; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Astrocytes; Cognition; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Transgenic","Gerasimov, E; Bezprozvanny, I; Vlasova, OL"

Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.,"Speech and language changes occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few studies have characterized their longitudinal course. We analyzed open-ended speech samples from a prodromal-to-mild AD cohort to develop a novel composite score to characterize progressive speech changes. Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD.

Using Health Forum Data to Assess User Needs for mHealth App Development: A Feasibility Study on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Online health forums are used by patients and caregivers as community and information resources, especially for chronic disease management, and could help determine user needs for digital health app design. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using online forum posts on Alzheimer's disease to inform user needs in mobile health application design and whether this process can be automated through text clustering methods. A total of 413 posts were analyzed manually through thematic coding and yielded three themes and nine subthemes for patient and caregiver needs. The external evaluation showed fair to substantial similarity between the automatically and manually derived labels. Four personas were developed to assess the validity of forum-generated needs.

Survey of Neuroanatomic Sampling and Staining Procedures in Alzheimer Disease Research Center Brain Banks.,"The collection of post-mortem brain tissue has been a core function of the Alzheimer Disease Research Center's (ADRCs) network located within the United States since its inception. Individual brain banks and centers follow detailed protocols to record, store, and manage complex datasets that include clinical data, demographics, and when post-mortem tissue is available, a detailed neuropathological assessment. Since each institution often has specific research foci, there can be variability in tissue collection and processing workflows. While published guidelines exist for select diseases, such as those put forth by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA), it is of importance to denote the current practices across institutions. To this end a survey was developed and sent to United States based brain bank leaders, collecting data on brain region sampling, including anatomic landmarks used, staining (including antibodies used), as well as whole-slide-image scanning hardware. We distributed this survey to 40 brain banks and obtained a response rate of 95% (38 / 40). Most brain banks followed guidelines defined by the NIA-AA, having H&E staining in all recommended regions and targeted region-based amyloid beta, tau, and alpha-synuclein immunohistochemical staining. However, sampling consistency varied related to key anatomic landmarks/locations in select regions, such as the striatum, periventricular white matter, and parietal cortex. This study highlights the diversity and similarities amongst brain banks and discusses considerations when amalgamating data/samples across multiple centers.

Integrative metabolomics science in Alzheimer's disease: Relevance and future perspectives.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is determined by various pathophysiological mechanisms starting 10-25 years before the onset of clinical symptoms. As multiple functionally interconnected molecular/cellular pathways appear disrupted in AD, the exploitation of high-throughput unbiased omics sciences is critical to elucidating the precise pathogenesis of AD. Among different omics, metabolomics is a fast-growing discipline allowing for the simultaneous detection and quantification of hundreds/thousands of perturbed metabolites in tissues or biofluids, reproducing the fluctuations of multiple networks affected by a disease. Here, we seek to critically depict the main metabolomics methodologies with the aim of identifying new potential AD biomarkers and further elucidating AD pathophysiological mechanisms. From a systems biology perspective, as metabolic alterations can occur before the development of clinical signs, metabolomics - coupled with existing accessible biomarkers used for AD screening and diagnosis - can support early disease diagnosis and help develop individualized treatment plans. Presently, the majority of metabolomic analyses emphasized that lipid metabolism is the most consistently altered pathway in AD pathogenesis. The possibility that metabolomics may reveal crucial steps in AD pathogenesis is undermined by the difficulty in discriminating between the causal or epiphenomenal or compensatory nature of metabolic findings.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amino acids; Biomarkers; Lipids; Metabolomics; Systems biology,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Metabolomics; Metabolome; Biomarkers,"Lista, S; González-Domínguez, R; López-Ortiz, S; González-Domínguez, Á; Menéndez, H; Martín-Hernández, J; Lucia, A; Emanuele, E; Centonze, D; Imbimbo, BP; Triaca, V; Lionetto, L; Simmaco, M; Cuperlovic-Culf, M; Mill, J; Li, L; Mapstone, M; Santos-Lozano, A; Nisticò, R"

Partially Observed Dynamic Tensor Response Regression.,"In modern data science, dynamic tensor data prevail in numerous applications. An important task is to characterize the relationship between dynamic tensor datasets and external covariates. However, the tensor data are often only partially observed, rendering many existing methods inapplicable. In this article, we develop a regression model with a partially observed dynamic tensor as the response and external covariates as the predictor. We introduce the low-rankness, sparsity, and fusion structures on the regression coefficient tensor, and consider a loss function projected over the observed entries. We develop an efficient nonconvex alternating updating algorithm, and derive the finite-sample error bound of the actual estimator from each step of our optimization algorithm. Unobserved entries in the tensor response have imposed serious challenges. As a result, our proposal differs considerably in terms of estimation algorithm, regularity conditions, as well as theoretical properties, compared to the existing tensor completion or tensor response regression solutions. We illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method using simulations and two real applications, including a neuroimaging dementia study and a digital advertising study.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Digital advertising; Neuroimaging analysis; Nonconvex optimization; Tensor completion; Tensor regression,,"Zhou, J; Sun, WW; Zhang, J; Li, L"

Drug Repurposing in Oncology: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials.,"Quality pharmacological treatment can improve survival in many types of cancer. Drug repurposing offers advantages in comparison with traditional drug development procedures, reducing time and risk. This systematic review identified the most recent randomized controlled clinical trials that focus on drug repurposing in oncology. We found that only a few clinical trials were placebo-controlled or standard-of-care-alone-controlled. Metformin has been studied for potential use in various types of cancer, including prostate, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Other studies assessed the possible use of the antiparasitic agent mebendazole in colorectal cancer and of propranolol in multiple myeloma or, when combined with etodolac, in breast cancer. We were able to identify trials that study the potential use of known antineoplastics in other non-oncological conditions, such as imatinib for severe coronavirus disease in 2019 or a study protocol aiming to assess the possible repurposing of leuprolide for Alzheimer's disease. Major limitations of these clinical trials were the small sample size, the high clinical heterogeneity of the participants regarding the stage of the neoplastic disease, and the lack of accounting for multimorbidity and other baseline clinical characteristics.

Comparison of histological delineations of medial temporal lobe cortices by four independent neuroanatomy laboratories.,"The medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortex, located adjacent to the hippocampus, is crucial for memory and prone to the accumulation of certain neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease neurofibrillary tau tangles. The MTL cortex is composed of several subregions which differ in their functional and cytoarchitectonic features. As neuroanatomical schools rely on different cytoarchitectonic definitions of these subregions, it is unclear to what extent their delineations of MTL cortex subregions overlap. Here, we provide an overview of cytoarchitectonic definitions of the cortices that make up the parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices) and the adjacent Brodmann areas (BA) 35 and 36, as provided by four neuroanatomists from different laboratories, aiming to identify the rationale for overlapping and diverging delineations. Nissl-stained series were acquired from the temporal lobes of three human specimens (two right and one left hemisphere). Slices (50 µm thick) were prepared perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus spanning the entire longitudinal extent of the MTL cortex. Four neuroanatomists annotated MTL cortex subregions on digitized (20X resolution) slices with 5 mm spacing. Parcellations, terminology, and border placement were compared among neuroanatomists. Cytoarchitectonic features of each subregion are described in detail. Qualitative analysis of the annotations showed higher agreement in the definitions of the entorhinal cortex and BA35, while definitions of BA36 and the parahippocampal cortex exhibited less overlap among neuroanatomists. The degree of overlap of cytoarchitectonic definitions was partially reflected in the neuroanatomists' agreement on the respective delineations.

Normative data for COGITAB: An Italian tablet-based test battery conceived for the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease.,"The number of people with dementia is increasing worldwide. Two main approaches have been adopted to identify subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD): the neuropsychological evaluation and the identification of biomarkers of AD. The first method is less invasive and easier to perform. This study assesses the psychometric properties of COGITAB, a novel web application d esigned to be sensitive to the subtle cognitive changes distinctive of the early Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and the preclinical phase of AD. We enrolled 518 healthy controls, classified according to several risk factors and the presence of a family history of dementia. The participants were given COGITAB after a neuropsychological screening. The COGITAB Total Score (TS) was significantly affected by age and years of education. Acquired risk factors and family history of dementia significantly impacted only the COGITAB total execution time (TET), not the TS. This study provides normative data for a newly developed web application. Control subjects with acquired risk factors performed slower, giving an important role to the TET recording. Further studies should examine the ability of this new technology to discriminate between healthy subjects and subjects with initial cognitive decline, even when not detected by standard neuropsychological assessments.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cognitive screening; digital cognitive assessment tool; preclinical AD,,"Beltrami, D; Barletta-Rodolfi, C; Bertini, F; Braglia, L; Calzà, L; Corbo, M; Gasparini, F; Marti, A; Montesi, D; Pisano, M; Rusconi, ML; Sozzi, M; Tonon, C; Ghidoni, E"

Loss of Y chromosome in leukocytes can be regarded as a male-specific age predictor for age group estimation in forensic genetics.,"Age prediction is an important field in forensic and aging research. Traditional methods used DNA methylation, telomere shortening, and mitochondrial DNA mutations to conduct age prediction models. Sex chromosomes, like the Y chromosome, have a significant role in aging as previously reported in hematopoietic disease and many non-reproductive cancers. Until now, there is no age predictor based on the percentage of loss of Y chromosome (LOY). LOY has been previously revealed to be correlated with Alzheimer's disease, short survival, and higher risk of cancer. The possible correlation of LOY between normal aging was not fully explored. In this study, we conducted age prediction by measuring LOY percentage by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), based on 232 healthy male samples, including 171 blood samples, 49 saliva samples, 12 semen samples. The age group of samples ranges from 0 to 99 years, with two individuals in almost every single age. Pearson correlation method was performed to calculate the correlation index. The result indicated a correlation index of 0.21 (p = 0.0059) between age and LOY percentage in blood samples, with the regression formula being y = - 0.016823 + 0.001098x. The correlation between LOY percentage and age is obvious only when the individuals were divided into different age groups (R = 0.73, p = 0.016). In the studied saliva and semen samples, p-values of the correlation are 0.11 and 0.20, respectively, showing no significant association between age and LOY percentage in these two biological materials. For the first time, we investigated male-specific age predictor based on LOY. The study showed that LOY in leukocytes can be regarded as a male-specific age predictor for age group estimation in forensic genetics. This study might be indicative for forensic applications and aging research.",2023,Age prediction; Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR); Loss of Y chromosome (LOY),"Humans; Male; Infant, Newborn; Infant; Child, Preschool; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Forensic Genetics; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Leukocytes; Aging; Neoplasms","Song, M; Jiang, L; Wang, X; Zhou, W; Wang, N; Hou, Y; Song, F"
Network connectivity and structural correlates of survival in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome.,"There is a pressing need to understand the factors that predict prognosis in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS), with high heterogeneity over the poor average survival. We test the hypothesis that the magnitude and distribution of connectivity changes in PSP and CBS predict the rate of progression and survival time, using datasets from the Cambridge Centre for Parkinson-plus and the UK National PSP Research Network (PROSPECT-MR). Resting-state functional MRI images were available from 146 participants with PSP, 82 participants with CBS, and 90 healthy controls. Large-scale networks were identified through independent component analyses, with correlations taken between component time series. Independent component analysis was also used to select between-network connectivity components to compare with baseline clinical severity, longitudinal rate of change in severity, and survival. Transdiagnostic survival predictors were identified using partial least squares regression for Cox models, with connectivity compared to patients' demographics, structural imaging, and clinical scores using five-fold cross-validation. In PSP and CBS, between-network connectivity components were identified that differed from controls, were associated with disease severity, and were related to survival and rate of change in clinical severity. A transdiagnostic component predicted survival beyond demographic and motion metrics but with lower accuracy than an optimal model that included the clinical and structural imaging measures. Cortical atrophy enhanced the connectivity changes that were most predictive of survival. Between-network connectivity is associated with variability in prognosis in PSP and CBS but does not improve predictive accuracy beyond clinical and structural imaging metrics.",2023,connectivity; corticobasal syndrome; fMRI; prediction; progressive supranuclear palsy; survival; tauopathies,"Humans; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; Corticobasal Degeneration; Prognosis; Neurodegenerative Diseases","Whiteside, DJ; Street, D; Murley, AG; Jones, PS; Malpetti, M; Ghosh, BCP; Coyle-Gilchrist, I; Gerhard, A; Hu, MT; Klein, JC; Leigh, PN; Church, A; Burn, DJ; Morris, HR; Rowe, JB; Rittman, T"
Primate brain pattern-based automated Alzheimer's disease detection model using EEG signals.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) may detect early changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disease. We have developed an automated AD detection model using a novel directed graph for local texture feature extraction with EEG signals. The proposed graph was created from a topological map of the macroscopic connectome, i.e., neuronal pathways linking anatomo-functional brain segments involved in visual object recognition and motor response in the primate brain. This primate brain pattern (PBP)-based model was tested on a public AD EEG signal dataset. The dataset comprised 16-channel EEG signal recordings of 12 AD patients and 11 healthy controls. While PBP could generate 448 low-level features per one-dimensional EEG signal, combining it with tunable q-factor wavelet transform created a multilevel feature extractor (which mimicked deep models) to generate 8,512 (= 448 × 19) features per signal input. Iterative neighborhood component analysis was used to choose the most discriminative features (the number of optimal features varied among the individual EEG channels) to feed to a weighted k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for binary classification into AD vs. healthy using both leave-one subject-out (LOSO) and tenfold cross-validations. Iterative majority voting was used to compute subject-level general performance results from the individual channel classification outputs. Channel-wise, as well as subject-level general results demonstrated exemplary performance. In addition, the model attained 100% and 92.01% accuracy for AD vs. healthy classification using the KNN classifier with tenfold and LOSO cross-validations, respectively. Our developed multilevel PBP-based model extracted discriminative features from EEG signals and paved the way for further development of models inspired by the brain connectome.",2023,AD detection; EEG signal classification; Feature engineering; Feature extraction; Primate brain modelling,,"Dogan, S; Baygin, M; Tasci, B; Loh, HW; Barua, PD; Tuncer, T; Tan, RS; Acharya, UR"

"Active and Assisted Living, a Practice for the Ageing Population and People with Cognitive Disabilities: An Architectural Perspective.","The current digital revolution is causing a paradigm shift encompassing all environments in which human beings conduct their daily activities. Technology is starting to govern the world, gradually modifying not only individual and social behaviour, but also ways of living. The necessary adaptation to new information and communication technologies forces societies to rethink both public and private spaces, in which evolution is slower than rapid social transformation. As part of this change, the concept of Active Assisted Living (AAL) has developed. Assisted spaces can be designed to provide older adults, carers, or people who have cognitive disabilities, such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, with a healthier, safer, and more comfortable life, while also affording them greater personal autonomy. AAL aims to improve people's quality of life and allow them to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, not in residences. This study conducted a critical review about AAL from an architectural point of view. The research adopted a qualitative approach in which we collected the studies during the last twenty years, then used descriptive, narrative and critical analysis methods. Based on these, this paper aims to explain this new technological paradigm, its characteristics, its main development trends, and its implementation limitations. The results obtained show how the development of AAL will be in the next ten years, and how this concept, and its application, can influence architecture and provide the bases for further research into the design of buildings and cities.",2023,Active Assisted Living; Ambient Assisted Living; ageing; ambient adapted to Alzheimer’s outpatients; ambient intelligence; cognitive architectural design; health humanities; healthy architecture,Humans; Aged; Quality of Life; Alzheimer Disease; Health Status; Aging; Cognition,"Quesada-García, S; Valero-Flores, P; Lozano-Gómez, M"

[The German S3 guidelines on dementia].,"Due to the demographic development, the number of dementia patients in Germany is continuously increasing. The complex care situation of those affected calls for meaningful guidelines. In 2008, the first S3 guideline on dementia was published, coordinated by the German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics (DGPPN) and the German Association for Neurology (DGN) and accompanied by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF). An update was published in 2016. In recent years, the diagnostic possibilities for Alzheimer's disease, in particular, have greatly developed and a new disease concept has emerged that includes mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as part of the clinical manifestation of the disease and also enables the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this phase. In the area of treatment, the first causal disease-modifying therapies will likely soon be available. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have also shown that up to 40% of the risks for dementia are dependent on modifiable risk factors, making prevention increasingly more important. In order to do justice to these developments a completely updated S3 guideline on dementia is currently being developed, which will be available digitally for the first time in the form of an app and which, in the sense of living guidelines, will enable rapid adjustments to progress in the future.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Living guidelines; Mild cognitive impairment; Prevention; Risk factors,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Psychotherapy; Psychiatry; Germany; Neurology,"Jessen, F; Bohr, L; Kruse, C; Dodel, R"

Model-Driven Dementia Prevention and Intervention Platform.,"Most types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, are not curable. However, there are risk factors, such as obesity or hypertension, that can promote the development of dementia. Holistic treatment of these risk factors can prevent the onset of dementia or delay it in its early stages. To support individualized treatment of risk factors in dementia, this paper presents a model-driven digital platform. It enables monitoring of biomarkers using smart devices from the internet of medical things (IoMT) for the target group. The collected data from such devices can be used to optimize and adjust treatment in a patient in the loop manner. To this end, providers such as Google Fit and Withings have been connected to the platform as example data sources. To achieve treatment and monitoring data interoperability with existing medical systems, internationally accepted standards such as FHIR are used. The configuration and control of the personalized treatment processes are achieved using a self-developed domain-specific language. For this language, an associated diagram editor was implemented, which allows the management of the treatment processes through graphical models. This graphical representation should help treatment providers to understand and manage these processes more easily. To investigate this hypothesis, a usability study was conducted with twelve participants. We were able to show that such graphical representations provide advantages in clarity in reviewing the system, but lack in easy set-up (compared to wizard-style systems).",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; FHIR; IoMT; digital prevention; internet of medical things; model-driven intervention planning; precision care; treatment platform,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Language; Data Collection; Palliative Care,"Schinle, M; Dietrich, M; Stock, S; Gerdes, M; Stork, W"
Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice and trials.,"Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials. Longitudinal measurements of such biomarkers will also improve the detection of relevant disease-modifying effects of new drugs or lifestyle interventions.",2023,,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers","Hansson, O; Blennow, K; Zetterberg, H; Dage, J"
Digital tools for delivery of dementia education for caregivers of persons with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of impact on caregiver distress and depressive symptoms.,"Continuing education for dementia has been shown to be beneficial by improving informal caregiver knowledge, dementia care, management, and caregiver physical and mental health. Technology-based dementia education has been noted to have equivalent effects as in-person education, but with the added benefit of asynchronous and/or remote delivery, which increases accessibility. Using Cochrane review methodology, this study systematically reviewed the literature on technology-based dementia education and its impacts on caregivers. Technology-based delivery included dementia education delivered via the Internet, telephone, telehealth, videophone, computer, or digital video device (DVD). In the review, twenty-eight studies were identified with fourteen included in a meta-analysis, and these data revealed a significant small effect of technologically based dementia education on reducing caregiver depression, and a medium effect on reducing caregiver distress in response to caregivers' observations of behavioral problems displayed by persons with dementia. No evidence was found for a significant effect of the educational intervention on caregiver burden or self-efficacy, which are known to be gendered aspects of caregiving. None of the studies included in the meta-analysis reported separate outcomes for male and female care providers, which has implications for gendered caregiving norms and aspects of care.

Déjà vécu with recollective confabulation: an unusual presentation of Alzheimer's disease.,"A man in his 80s presented with gradual onset of a persistent and delusion-like perception that novel encounters are repetitions of previous experiences. Within 2 years of symptom onset, he had impaired verbal memory and executive dysfunction on neuropsychological assessment. Cerebrospinal fluid core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers analysis supported probable AD. Generalised and left temporal atrophy was seen on MRI of the brain. Neurological fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed left temporal and bilateral frontal lobe hypometabolism. His presenting symptom is known as déjà vécu with recollective confabulation, a rare phenomenon associated with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. While several potential mechanisms have been previously proposed, the fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT hypometabolism in the temporal and frontal lobes in this case suggests dual deficits in recognition memory and metacognition may be culprit mechanisms.

Data-driven neuropathological staging and subtyping of TDP-43 proteinopathies.,"TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) accumulation is the primary pathology underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Charting the progression and heterogeneity of TDP-43 accumulation is necessary to better characterize TDP-43 proteinopathies, but current TDP-43 staging systems are heuristic and assume each syndrome is homogeneous. Here, we use data-driven disease progression modelling to derive a fine-grained empirical staging system for the classification and differentiation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP, n = 126), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 141) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) with and without Alzheimer's disease (n = 304). The data-driven staging of ALS and FTLD-TDP complement and extend previously described human-defined staging schema for ALS and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In LATE-NC individuals, progression along data-driven stages was positively associated with age, but negatively associated with age in individuals with FTLD-TDP. Using only regional TDP-43 severity, our data driven model distinguished individuals diagnosed with ALS, FTLD-TDP or LATE-NC with a cross-validated accuracy of 85.9%, with misclassifications associated with mixed pathological diagnosis, age and genetic mutations. Adding age and SuStaIn stage to this model increased accuracy to 92.3%. Our model differentiates LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP, though some overlap was observed between late-stage LATE-NC and early-stage FTLD-TDP. We further tested for the presence of subtypes with distinct regional TDP-43 progression patterns within each diagnostic group, identifying two distinct cortical-predominant and brainstem-predominant subtypes within FTLD-TDP and a further two subcortical-predominant and corticolimbic-predominant subtypes within ALS. The FTLD-TDP subtypes exhibited differing proportions of TDP-43 type, while there was a trend for age differing between ALS subtypes. Interestingly, a negative relationship between age and SuStaIn stage was seen in the brainstem/subcortical-predominant subtype of each proteinopathy. No subtypes were observed for the LATE-NC group, despite aggregating individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease and a larger sample size for this group. Overall, we provide an empirical pathological TDP-43 staging system for ALS, FTLD-TDP and LATE-NC, which yielded accurate classification. We further demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity amongst ALS and FTLD-TDP progression patterns that warrants further investigation in larger cross-cohort studies.",2023,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; frontotemporal lobar degeneration; limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy; machine learning; neuropathological staging,Humans; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Frontotemporal Dementia; Alzheimer Disease; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; DNA-Binding Proteins,"Young, AL; Vogel, JW; Robinson, JL; McMillan, CT; Ossenkoppele, R; Wolk, DA; Irwin, DJ; Elman, L; Grossman, M; Lee, VMY; Lee, EB; Hansson, O"
Quantitative detection of dopamine in human serum with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of constrained vibrational mode.,"Dopamine (DA) is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in the hormonal, nervous, and vascular systems being considered as an index to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we demonstrate the quantitative sensing of DA using the peak shift in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA), resulting from the concentration of DA. To enable the signal enhancement of Raman scattering, Ag nanostructure was built with one-step gas-flow sputtering. 4-MPBA was then introduced using vapor-based deposition, acting as a reporter molecule for bonding with DA.

Differential association of cerebral blood flow and anisocytosis in APOE ε4 carriers at midlife.,"Cerebral hemodynamic alterations have been observed in apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4) carriers at midlife, however the physiological underpinnings of this observation are poorly understood. Our goal was to investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its spatial coefficient of variation (CoV) in relation to APOE4 and a measure of erythrocyte anisocytosis (red blood cell distribution width - RDW) in a middle-aged cohort. Data from 563 participants in the PREVENT-Dementia study scanned with 3 T MRI cross-sectionally were analysed. Voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses within nine vascular regions were run to detect areas of altered perfusion. Within the vascular regions, interaction terms between APOE4 and RDW in predicting CBF were examined. Areas of hyperperfusion in APOE4 carriers were detected mainly in frontotemporal regions. The APOE4 allele differentially moderated the association between RDW and CBF, an association which was more prominent in the distal vascular territories (p - [0.01, 0.05]). The CoV was not different between the considered groups. We provide novel evidence that in midlife, RDW and CBF are differentially associated in APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. This association is consistent with a differential hemodynamic response to hematological alterations in APOE4 carriers.",2023,APOE4; CBF; RDW; hemodynamics; perfusion,Humans; Middle Aged; Age Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Erythrocyte Indices; Heterozygote,"Dounavi, ME; Mak, E; Swann, P; Low, A; Muniz-Terrera, G; McKeever, A; Pope, M; Williams, GB; Wells, K; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Malhotra, P; Mackay, C; Koychev, I; Ritchie, K; Su, L; Ritchie, CW; O'Brien, JT"

[Mobile everyday-life digital technologies for the prevention of Alzheimer's dementia: cognitive health and cognitive safety].,"It is generally accepted that the treatment of Alzheimer's disease should be flanked by preventive measures for risk reduction in order to maintain cognitive functions for as long as possible; however, the research and development of treatment concepts are both faced with challenges. The preventive risk reduction necessitates a high level of coordination of neurology and psychiatry with other disciplines. Also, patients must develop a high level of health competence and summon up self-motivation and adherence. This concept article deals with the question of how mobile everyday-life digital technologies can help to address these challenges. The core prerequisite is the interdisciplinary coordinated structuring of prevention with the focus on cognitive health and cognitive safety. Cognitive health relates to a reduction of risk factors associated with lifestyle. Cognitive safety concerns the avoidance of iatrogenic side effects on cognitive functions. Digital technologies that are relevant in this context are mobile apps based on smartphones or tablets for everyday-life and high-frequency recording of cognitive functions, apps that can coach the implementation of lifestyle changes as companion technologies, apps that can assist in the reduction of iatrogenic risks and those that can improve the health competence of patients and relatives. The state of development of such medical products is at different stages of progress. Therefore, this concept article does not provide a review of existing products but rather deals with the fundamental interplay of potential solutions in the prevention of Alzheimer dementia in the areas of cognitive health and cognitive safety.",2023,Health competence; Interdisciplinary medicine; Preventive measures; Risk reduction; Treatment concepts,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Digital Technology; Cognition; Smartphone; Mobile Applications,"Düzel, E; Thyrian, JR"

Distinct and joint effects of low and high levels of Aβ and tau deposition on cortical thickness.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by the presence of Amyloid-β (Aβ),tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN framework) in the human cerebral cortex. Yet, prior studies have suggested that Aβ deposition can be associated with both cortical thinning and thickening. These contradictory results are attributed to small sample sizes, the presence versus absence of tau, and limited detectability in the earliest phase of protein deposition, which may begin in young adulthood and cannot be captured in studies enrolling only older subjects. In this study, we aimed to find the distinct and joint effects of Aβ andtau on neurodegeneration during the progression from normal to abnormal stages of pathologies that remain elusive.

"Unsupervised, frequent and remote: A novel platform for personalised digital phenotyping of long-term memory in humans.","Long-term memory tests are commonly used to facilitate the diagnosis of hippocampal-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease due to their relatively high specificity and sensitivity to damage to the medial temporal lobes compared to standard commonly used clinical tests. Pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease start years before the formal diagnosis is made, partially due to testing too late. This proof-of-concept exploratory study aimed to assess the feasibility of introducing an unsupervised digital platform for continuous testing of long-term memory over long periods outside the laboratory environment. To address this challenge, we developed a novel digital platform, hAge ('healthy Age'), which integrates double spatial alternation, image recognition and visuospatial tasks for frequent remote unsupervised assessment of spatial and non-spatial long-term memory carried out continuously over eight week period. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we tested whether we could achieve sufficient levels of adherence and whether the performance on hAge tasks is comparable to the performance observed in the analogous standard tests measured in the controlled laboratory environments.191 healthy adults (67% females, 18-81 years old) participated in the study. We report an estimated 42.4% adherence level with minimal inclusion criteria. In line with findings using standard laboratory tests, we showed that performance on the spatial alternation task negatively correlated with inter-trial periods and the performance levels on image recognition and visuospatial tasks could be controlled by varying image similarity. Importantly, we demonstrated that frequent engagement with the double spatial alternation task leads to a strong practice effect, previously identified as a potential measure of cognitive decline in MCI patients. Finally, we discuss how lifestyle and motivation confounds may present a serious challenge for cognitive assessment in real-world uncontrolled environments.",2023,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Long-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; Recognition, Psychology; Proof of Concept Study","Bauza, M; Krstulovic, M; Krupic, J"
MultiCens: Multilayer network centrality measures to uncover molecular mediators of tissue-tissue communication.,"With the evolution of multicellularity, communication among cells in different tissues and organs became pivotal to life. Molecular basis of such communication has long been studied, but genome-wide screens for genes and other biomolecules mediating tissue-tissue signaling are lacking. To systematically identify inter-tissue mediators, we present a novel computational approach MultiCens (Multilayer/Multi-tissue network Centrality measures). Unlike single-layer network methods, MultiCens can distinguish within- vs. across-layer connectivity to quantify the ""influence"" of any gene in a tissue on a query set of genes of interest in another tissue. MultiCens enjoys theoretical guarantees on convergence and decomposability, and performs well on synthetic benchmarks. On human multi-tissue datasets, MultiCens predicts known and novel genes linked to hormones. MultiCens further reveals shifts in gene network architecture among four brain regions in Alzheimer's disease. MultiCens-prioritized hypotheses from these two diverse applications, and potential future ones like ""Multi-tissue-expanded Gene Ontology"" analysis, can enable whole-body yet molecular-level systems investigations in humans.",2023,,Humans; Brain; Gene Regulatory Networks; Alzheimer Disease,"Kumar, T; Sethuraman, R; Mitra, S; Ravindran, B; Narayanan, M"

Association between APOE genotype and microglial cell morphology.,"APOE is the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) with E4 conferring an increased risk for AD compared to E3. The ApoE protein can impact diverse pathways in the brain including neuroinflammation but the precise impact of ApoE isoforms on inflammation remains unknown. As microglia are a primary source of neuroinflammation, this study determined whether ApoE isoforms have an impact on microglial morphology and activation using immunohistochemistry and digital analyses. Analysis of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunoreactivity indicated greater microglial activation in both the hippocampus and superior and middle temporal gyrus (SMTG) in dementia participants versus non-demented controls. Further, only an increase in activation was seen in E3-Dementia participants in the entire SMTG, whereas in the grey matter of the SMTG, only a diagnosis of dementia impacted activation. Specific microglial morphologies showed a reduction in ramified microglia in the dementia group. For rod microglia, a reduction was seen in E4-Control patients in the hippocampus whereas in the SMTG an increase was seen in E4-Dementia patients. These findings suggest an association between ApoE isoforms and microglial morphologies and highlight the importance of considering ApoE isoforms in studies of AD pathology.",2023,Alzheimer disease; ApoE; Microglia; Neuropathology,Humans; Microglia; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins E; Genotype; Protein Isoforms; Apolipoprotein E4,"Kloske, CM; Gearon, MD; Weekman, EM; Rogers, C; Patel, E; Bachstetter, A; Nelson, PT; Wilcock, DM"

Sex and gender considerations in Alzheimer's disease: The Women's Brain Project contribution.,"The global population is expected to have about 131.5 million people living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias by 2050, posing a severe health crisis. Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that gradually impairs physical and cognitive functions. Dementia has a variety of causes, symptoms, and heterogeneity concerning the influence of sex on prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes. The proportion of male-to-female prevalence varies based on the type of dementia. Despite some types of dementia being more common in men, women have a greater lifetime risk of developing dementia. AD is the most common form of dementia in which approximately two-thirds of the affected persons are women. Profound sex and gender differences in physiology and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions have increasingly been identified. As a result, new approaches to dementia diagnosis, care, and patient journeys should be considered. In the heart of a rapidly aging worldwide population, the Women's Brain Project (WBP) was born from the necessity to address the sex and gender gap in AD. WBP is now a well-established international non-profit organization with a global multidisciplinary team of experts studying sex and gender determinants in the brain and mental health. WBP works with different stakeholders worldwide to help change perceptions and reduce sex biases in clinical and preclinical research and policy frameworks. With its strong female leadership, WBP is an example of the importance of female professionals' work in the field of dementia research. WBP-led peer-reviewed papers, articles, books, lectures, and various initiatives in the policy and advocacy space have profoundly impacted the community and driven global discussion. WBP is now in the initial phases of establishing the world's first Sex and Gender Precision Medicine Institute. This review highlights the contributions of the WBP team to the field of AD. This review aims to increase awareness of potentially important aspects of basic science, clinical outcomes, digital health, policy framework and provide the research community with potential challenges and research suggestions to leverage sex and gender differences.

Visual-somatosensory integration (VSI) as a novel marker of Alzheimer's disease: A comprehensive overview of the VSI study.,"Identification of novel, non-invasive, non-cognitive based markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are a global priority. Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's pathology manifests in sensory association areas well before appearing in neural regions involved in higher-order cognitive functions, such as memory. Previous investigations have not comprehensively examined the interplay of sensory, cognitive, and motor dysfunction with relation to AD progression. The ability to successfully integrate multisensory information across multiple sensory modalities is a vital aspect of everyday functioning and mobility. Our research suggests that multisensory integration, specifically visual-somatosensory integration (VSI), could be used as a novel marker for preclinical AD given previously reported associations with important motor (balance, gait, and falls) and cognitive (attention) outcomes in aging. While the adverse effect of dementia and cognitive impairment on the relationship between multisensory functioning and motor outcomes has been highlighted, the underlying functional and neuroanatomical networks are still unknown. In what follows we detail the protocol for our study, named The VSI Study, which is strategically designed to determine whether preclinical AD is associated with neural disruptions in subcortical and cortical areas that concurrently modulate multisensory, cognitive, and motor functions resulting in mobility decline. In this longitudinal observational study, a total of 208 community-dwelling older adults with and without preclinical AD will be recruited and monitored yearly. Our experimental design affords assessment of multisensory integration as a new behavioral marker for preclinical AD; identification of functional neural networks involved in the intersection of sensory, motor, and cognitive functioning; and determination of the impact of early AD on future mobility declines, including incident falls.

A scoping review of neurodegenerative manifestations in explainable digital phenotyping.,"Neurologists nowadays no longer view neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, as single entities, but rather as a spectrum of multifaceted symptoms with heterogeneous progression courses and treatment responses. The definition of the naturalistic behavioral repertoire of early neurodegenerative manifestations is still elusive, impeding early diagnosis and intervention. Central to this view is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in reinforcing the depth of phenotypic information, thereby supporting the paradigm shift to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. This suggestion advocates the definition of disease subtypes in a new biomarker-supported nosology framework, yet without empirical consensus on standardization, reliability and interpretability. Although the well-defined neurodegenerative processes, linked to a triad of motor and non-motor preclinical symptoms, are detected by clinical intuition, we undertake an unbiased data-driven approach to identify different patterns of neuropathology distribution based on the naturalistic behavior data inherent to populations in-the-wild. We appraise the role of remote technologies in the definition of digital phenotyping specific to brain-, body- and social-level neurodegenerative subtle symptoms, emphasizing inter- and intra-patient variability powered by deep learning. As such, the present review endeavors to exploit digital technologies and AI to create disease-specific phenotypic explanations, facilitating the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases as ""bio-psycho-social"" conditions. Not only does this translational effort within explainable digital phenotyping foster the understanding of disease-induced traits, but it also enhances diagnostic and, eventually, treatment personalization.",2023,,,"Alfalahi, H; Dias, SB; Khandoker, AH; Chaudhuri, KR; Hadjileontiadis, LJ"

Reduction of human Alzheimer's disease risk and reversal of mouse model cognitive deficit with nucleoside analog use.,"Innate immune signaling through the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia.

Here we report that in humans, NRTI exposure was associated with a significantly lower incidence of AD in two of the largest health insurance databases in the United States. Treatment of aged 5xFAD mice (a mouse model of amyloid-β deposition that expresses five mutations found in familial AD) with Kamuvudine-9 (K-9), an NRTI-derivative with enhanced safety profile, reduced Aβ deposition and reversed their cognitive deficit by improving their spatial memory and learning performance to that of young wild-type mice.

AD-1 Small Molecule Improves Learning and Memory Function in Scopolamine-Induced Amnesic Mice Model through Regulation of CREB/BDNF and NF-κB/MAPK Signaling Pathway.,"Cognitive decline and memory impairment induced by oxidative brain damage are the critical pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on the potential neuroprotective effects of AD-1 small molecule, we here explored the possible underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of AD-1 small molecule against scopolamine-induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. According to our findings, scopolamine administration resulted in increased AChE activity, MDA levels, and decreased antioxidant enzymes, as well as the downregulation of the antioxidant response proteins of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression; however, treatment with AD-1 small molecule mitigated the generation of oxidant factors while restoring the antioxidant enzymes status, in addition to improving antioxidant protein levels. Similarly, AD-1 small molecule significantly increased the protein expression of neuroprotective markers such as BDNF and CREB and promoted memory processes in scopolamine-induced mice. Western blot analysis showed that AD-1 small molecule reduced activated microglia and astrocytes via the attenuation of iba-1 and GFAP protein expression. We also found that scopolamine enhanced the phosphorylation of NF-κB/MAPK signaling and, conversely, that AD-1 small molecule significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB/MAPK signaling in the brain regions of hippocampus and cortex. We further found that scopolamine promoted neuronal loss by inducing Bax and caspase-3 and reducing the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. In contrast, AD-1 small molecule significantly decreased the levels of apoptotic markers and increased neuronal survival. Furthermore, AD-1 small molecule ameliorated scopolamine-induced impairments in spatial learning behavior and memory formation. These findings revealed that AD-1 small molecule attenuated scopolamine-induced cognitive and memory dysfunction by ameliorating AChE activity, oxidative brain damage, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis.",2023,AD−1 small molecule; apoptosis; memory impairment; neuroinflammation; oxidative stress; scopolamine,,"Balakrishnan, R; Park, JY; Cho, DY; Ahn, JY; Yoo, DS; Seol, SH; Yoon, SH; Choi, DK"
Mobile health to promote physical activity in people post stroke or transient ischemic attack - study protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled trial.,"Physical activity is essential to improve health and reduce the risk of recurrence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Still, people post stroke or TIA are often physically inactive and the availability of physical activity promotion services are often limited. This study builds on an existing Australian telehealth-delivered programme (i-REBOUND- Let's get moving) which provides support for home-based physical activity for people post stroke or TIA. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a mobile Health (mHealth) version of the i-REBOUND programme for the promotion of physical activity in people post stroke or TIA living in Sweden.",2023,Behaviour change; Complex interventions; E-Health; Feasibility; Physical exercise; Secondary prevention,"Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Quality of Life; Feasibility Studies; Australia; Stroke; Exercise; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Thurston, C; Bezuidenhout, L; Humphries, S; Johansson, S; von Koch, L; Häger, CK; Holmlund, L; Sundberg, CJ; Garcia-Ptacek, S; Kwak, L; Nilsson, M; English, C; Conradsson, DM"
Seed amplification and neurodegeneration marker trajectories in individuals at risk of prion disease.,"Human prion diseases are remarkable for long incubation times followed typically by rapid clinical decline. Seed amplification assays and neurodegeneration biofluid biomarkers are remarkably useful in the clinical phase, but their potential to predict clinical onset in healthy people remains unclear. This is relevant not only to the design of preventive strategies in those at-risk of prion diseases, but more broadly, because prion-like mechanisms are thought to underpin many neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report the accrual of a longitudinal biofluid resource in patients, controls and healthy people at risk of prion diseases, to which ultrasensitive techniques such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and single molecule array (Simoa) digital immunoassays were applied for preclinical biomarker discovery. We studied 648 CSF and plasma samples, including 16 people who had samples taken when healthy but later developed inherited prion disease (IPD) ('converters'; range from 9.9 prior to, and 7.4 years after onset). Symptomatic IPD CSF samples were screened by RT-QuIC assay variations, before testing the entire collection of at-risk samples using the most sensitive assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), tau and UCH-L1 levels were measured in plasma and CSF. Second generation (IQ-CSF) RT-QuIC proved 100% sensitive and specific for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), iatrogenic and familial CJD phenotypes, and subsequently detected seeding activity in four presymptomatic CSF samples from three E200K carriers; one converted in under 2 months while two remain asymptomatic after at least 3 years' follow-up. A bespoke HuPrP P102L RT-QuIC showed partial sensitivity for P102L disease. No compatible RT-QuIC assay was discovered for classical 6-OPRI, A117V and D178N, and these at-risk samples tested negative with bank vole RT-QuIC. Plasma GFAP and NfL, and CSF NfL levels emerged as proximity markers of neurodegeneration in the typically slow IPDs (e.g. P102L), with significant differences in mean values segregating healthy control from IPD carriers (within 2 years to onset) and symptomatic IPD cohorts; plasma GFAP appears to change before NfL, and before clinical conversion. In conclusion, we show distinct biomarker trajectories in fast and slow IPDs. Specifically, we identify several years of presymptomatic seeding positivity in E200K, a new proximity marker (plasma GFAP) and sequential neurodegenerative marker evolution (plasma GFAP followed by NfL) in slow IPDs. We suggest a new preclinical staging system featuring clinical, seeding and neurodegeneration aspects, for validation with larger prion at-risk cohorts, and with potential application to other neurodegenerative proteopathies.",2023,GFAP; NfL; RT-QuIC; inherited; prion,Humans; tau Proteins; Prion Diseases; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Prions; Biomarkers,"Mok, TH; Nihat, A; Majbour, N; Sequeira, D; Holm-Mercer, L; Coysh, T; Darwent, L; Batchelor, M; Groveman, BR; Orr, CD; Hughson, AG; Heslegrave, A; Laban, R; Veleva, E; Paterson, RW; Keshavan, A; Schott, JM; Swift, IJ; Heller, C; Rohrer, JD; Gerhard, A; Butler, C; Rowe, JB; Masellis, M; Chapman, M; Lunn, MP; Bieschke, J; Jackson, GS; Zetterberg, H; Caughey, B; Rudge, P; Collinge, J; Mead, S"
The Future of Cognitive Screening in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Cognitive screening instruments (CSI) have variable sensitivity and specificity to the cognitive changes associated with dementia syndromes, and the most recent systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the benefit of cognitive screening tools in older adults residing within the community. Consequently, there is a critical need to improve CSI methods, which have not yet incorporated advances in psychometrics, neuroscience, and technology. The primary goal of this article is to provide a framework for transitioning from legacy CSIs to advanced dementia screening measurement. In line with ongoing efforts in neuropsychology and the call for next-generation digital assessment for early detection of AD, we propose a psychometrically advanced (including application of item response theory methods), automated selective assessment model that provides a framework to help propel an assessment revolution. Further, we present a three-phase model for modernizing CSIs and discuss critical diversity and inclusion issues, current challenges in differentiating normal from pathological aging, and ethical considerations.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; cognitivescreening instruments; dementia; neuropsychology,Humans; Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Aging; Psychometrics; Dementia; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease,"Umfleet, LG; Bilder, RM; Loring, DW; Thames, A; Hampstead, BM; Bauer, RM; Drane, DL; Cavanagh, L"

Hence, digital markers of language and speech may offer a method for screening of at-risk populations that are at the earliest stages of AD, eventually in combination with advanced machine learning. To this end, we developed a screening battery consisting of speech-based neurocognitive tests.

Early amygdala and ERC atrophy linked to 3D reconstruction of rostral neurofibrillary tau tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Previous research has emphasized the unique impact of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a reflection that tau pathology is particularly striking in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortex (ERC, TEC) early in the course of disease. However, other brain regions are affected by AD pathology during its early phases. Here, we use longitudinal diffeomorphometry to measure the atrophy rate from MRI of the amygdala compared with that in the ERC and TEC in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls, CU individuals who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with MCI who progressed to dementia of the AD type (DAT), using a dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results show significantly higher atrophy rates of the amygdala in both groups of 'converters' (CU→MCI, MCI→DAT) compared to controls, with rates of volume loss comparable to rates of thickness loss in the ERC and TEC. We localize atrophy within the amygdala within each of these groups using fixed effects modeling. Controlling for the familywise error rate highlights the medial regions of the amygdala as those with significantly higher atrophy in both groups of converters than in controls. Using our recently developed method, referred to as Projective LDDMM, we map measures of neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) from digital pathology to MRI atlases and reconstruct dense 3D spatial distributions of NFT density within regions of the MTL. The distribution of NFTs is consistent with the spatial distribution of MR measured atrophy rates, revealing high densities (and atrophy) in the amygdala (particularly medial), ERC, and rostral third of the MTL. The similarity of the location of NFTs in AD and shape changes in a well-defined clinical population suggests that amygdalar atrophy rate, as measured through MRI may be a viable biomarker for AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amygdala atrophy; Digital pathology; MRI biomarkers,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Temporal Lobe; Amygdala; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Atrophy; Cognitive Dysfunction","Stouffer, KM; Chen, C; Kulason, S; Xu, E; Witter, MP; Ceritoglu, C; Albert, MS; Mori, S; Troncoso, J; Tward, DJ; Miller, MI"
The localization of molecularly distinct microglia populations to Alzheimer's disease pathologies using QUIVER.,"New histological techniques are needed to examine protein distribution in human tissues, which can reveal cell shape and disease pathology connections. Spatial proteomics has changed the study of tumor microenvironments by identifying spatial relationships of immunomodulatory cells and proteins and contributing to the discovery of new cancer immunotherapy biomarkers. However, the fast-expanding toolkit of spatial proteomic approaches has yet to be systematically applied to investigate pathological alterations in the aging human brain in health and disease states. Moreover, post-mortem human brain tissue presents distinct technical problems due to fixation procedures and autofluorescence, which limit fluorescence methodologies. This study sought to develop a multiplex immunohistochemistry approach (visualizing the immunostain with brightfield microscopy). Quantitative multiplex Immunohistochemistry with Visual colorimetric staining to Enhance Regional protein localization (QUIVER) was developed to address these technical challenges. Using QUIVER, a ten-channel pseudo-fluorescent image was generated using chromogen removal and digital microscopy to identify unique molecular microglia phenotypes. Next, the study asked if the tissue environment, specifically the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, has any bearing on microglia's cellular and molecular phenotypes. QUIVER allowed the visualization of five molecular microglia/macrophage phenotypes using digital pathology tools. The recognizable reactive and homeostatic microglia/macrophage phenotypes demonstrated spatial polarization towards and away from amyloid plaques, respectively. Yet, microglia morphology appearance did not always correspond to molecular phenotype. This research not only sheds light on the biology of microglia but also offers QUIVER, a new tool for examining pathological alterations in the brains of the elderly.",2023,Digital pathology; Glia; Histology; Multiplexed tissue imaging; Neurodegenerative disease; Neuropathology; Single-cell analysis,"Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Microglia; Plaque, Amyloid; Proteomics; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Brain; Tremor; Amyloid beta-Peptides","Shahidehpour, RK; Nelson, AS; Sanders, LG; Embry, CR; Nelson, PT; Bachstetter, AD"

Wearable device and smartphone data quantify ALS progression and may provide novel outcome measures.,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapeutic development has largely relied on staff-administered functional rating scales to determine treatment efficacy. We sought to determine if mobile applications (apps) and wearable devices can be used to quantify ALS disease progression through active (surveys) and passive (sensors) data collection. Forty ambulatory adults with ALS were followed for 6-months. The Beiwe app was used to administer the self-entry ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-RSE) and the Rasch Overall ALS Disability Scale (ROADS) surveys every 2-4 weeks. Each participant used a wrist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph Insight Watch) or an ankle-worn activity monitor (Modus StepWatch) continuously. Wearable device wear and app survey compliance were adequate. ALSFRS-R highly correlated with ALSFRS-RSE. Several wearable data daily physical activity measures demonstrated statistically significant change over time and associations with ALSFRS-RSE and ROADS.

The importance of high quality real-life social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The coronavirus pandemic has brought about dramatic restrictions to real-life social interactions and a shift towards more online social encounters. Positive social interactions have been highlighted as an important protective factor, with previous studies suggesting an involvement of the amygdala in the relationship between social embeddedness and well-being. The present study investigated the effect of the quality of real-life and online social interactions on mood, and explored whether this association is affected by an individual's amygdala activity. Sixty-two participants of a longitudinal study took part in a one-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) during the first lockdown, reporting their momentary well-being and their engagement in real-life and online social interactions eight times per day (N ~ 3000 observations). Amygdala activity was assessed before the pandemic during an emotion-processing task. Mixed models were calculated to estimate the association between social interactions and well-being, including two-way interactions to test for the moderating effect of amygdala activity. We found a positive relationship between real-life interactions and momentary well-being. In contrast, online interactions had no effect on well-being. Moreover, positive real-life social interactions augmented this social affective benefit, especially in individuals with higher amygdala being more sensitive to the interaction quality. Our findings demonstrate a mood-lifting effect of positive real-life social interactions during the pandemic, which was dependent on amygdala activity before the pandemic. As no corresponding effect was found between online social interactions and well-being, it can be concluded that increased online social interactions may not compensate for the absence of real-life social interactions.",2023,,Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Longitudinal Studies; Social Interaction; Communicable Disease Control,"Monninger, M; Aggensteiner, PM; Pollok, TM; Kaiser, A; Reinhard, I; Hermann, A; Reichert, M; Ebner-Priemer, UW; Meyer-Lindenberg, A; Brandeis, D; Banaschewski, T; Holz, NE"
Recognizing Human Activity of Daily Living Using a Flexible Wearable for 3D Spine Pose Tracking.,"The World Health Organization recognizes physical activity as an influencing domain on quality of life. Monitoring, evaluating, and supervising it by wearable devices can contribute to the early detection and progress assessment of diseases such as Alzheimer's, rehabilitation, and exercises in telehealth, as well as abrupt events such as a fall. In this work, we use a non-invasive and non-intrusive flexible wearable device for 3D spine pose measurement to monitor and classify physical activity. We develop a comprehensive protocol that consists of 10 indoor, 4 outdoor, and 8 transition states activities in three categories of static, dynamic, and transition in order to evaluate the applicability of the flexible wearable device in human activity recognition. We implement and compare the performance of three neural networks: long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and a hybrid model (CNN-LSTM). For ground truth, we use an accelerometer and strips data. LSTM reached an overall classification accuracy of 98% for all activities. The CNN model with accelerometer data delivered better performance in lying down (100%), static (standing = 82%, sitting = 75%), and dynamic (walking = 100%, running = 100%) positions. Data fusion improved the outputs in standing (92%) and sitting (94%), while LSTM with the strips data yielded a better performance in bending-related activities (bending forward = 49%, bending backward = 88%, bending right = 92%, and bending left = 100%), the combination of data fusion and principle components analysis further strengthened the output (bending forward = 100%, bending backward = 89%, bending right = 100%, and bending left = 100%). Moreover, the LSTM model detected the first transition state that is similar to fall with the accuracy of 84%. The results show that the wearable device can be used in a daily routine for activity monitoring, recognition, and exercise supervision, but still needs further improvement for fall detection.",2023,activity of daily living; human activity recognition; neural network; quality of life; wearable device,"Humans; Quality of Life; Human Activities; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Memory, Long-Term","Haghi, M; Ershadi, A; Deserno, TM"

A New Smart 2-Min Mobile Alerting Method for Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease in the Community.,"The early identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), in an early stage of AD can expand the AD warning window. We propose a new capability index evaluating the spatial execution process (SEP), which can dynamically evaluate the execution process in the space navigation task. The hypothesis is proposed that there are neurobehavioral differences between normal cognitive (NC) elderly and AD patients with MCI reflected in digital biomarkers captured during SEP. According to this, we designed a new smart 2-min mobile alerting method for MCI due to AD, for community screening. Two digital biomarkers, total mission execution distance (METRtotal) and execution distance above the transverse obstacle (EDabove), were selected by step-up regression analysis. For the participants with more than 9 years of education, the alerting efficiency of the combination of the two digital biomarkers for MCI due to AD could reach 0.83. This method has the advantages of fast speed, high alerting efficiency, low cost and high intelligence and thus has a high application value for community screening in developing countries. It also provides a new intelligent alerting approach based on the human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigm for MCI due to AD in community screening.",2023,alerting in the community; digital biomarkers; mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease; spatial execution process,,"Wang, Y; Chen, T; Wang, C; Ogihara, A; Ma, X; Huang, S; Zhou, S; Li, S; Liu, J; Li, K"

Long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in an app and wearable-based multinational remote digital depression study.,"Recent growth in digital technologies has enabled the recruitment and monitoring of large and diverse populations in remote health studies. However, the generalizability of inference drawn from remotely collected health data could be severely impacted by uneven participant engagement and attrition over the course of the study. We report findings on long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in a large multinational observational digital study for depression containing active (surveys) and passive sensor data collected via Android smartphones, and Fitbit devices from 614 participants for up to 2 years. Majority of participants (67.6%) continued to remain engaged in the study after 43 weeks. Unsupervised clustering of participants' study apps and Fitbit usage data showed 3 distinct engagement subgroups for each data stream. We found: (i) the least engaged group had the highest depression severity (4 PHQ8 points higher) across all data streams; (ii) the least engaged group (completed 4 bi-weekly surveys) took significantly longer to respond to survey notifications (3.8 h more) and were 5 years younger compared to the most engaged group (completed 20 bi-weekly surveys); and (iii) a considerable proportion (44.6%) of the participants who stopped completing surveys after 8 weeks continued to share passive Fitbit data for significantly longer (average 42 weeks). Additionally, multivariate survival models showed participants' age, ownership and brand of smartphones, and recruitment sites to be associated with retention in the study. Together these findings could inform the design of future digital health studies to enable equitable and balanced data collection from diverse populations.",2023,,,"Zhang, Y; Pratap, A; Folarin, AA; Sun, S; Cummins, N; Matcham, F; Vairavan, S; Dineley, J; Ranjan, Y; Rashid, Z; Conde, P; Stewart, C; White, KM; Oetzmann, C; Ivan, A; Lamers, F; Siddi, S; Rambla, CH; Simblett, S; Nica, R; Mohr, DC; Myin-Germeys, I; Wykes, T; Haro, JM; Penninx, BWJH; Annas, P; Narayan, VA; Hotopf, M; Dobson, RJB"
Digital care at home: Exploring the role of smart consumer devices.,"In-home 'smart' consumer devices such as voice assistants, doorbells, thermostats, and lightbulbs have been advocated by organisations in the UK such as the RNIB, Alzheimer Scotland, and the NHS. Yet the use of these devices, which are not purposely designed as care devices and therefore are not subject to evaluation and regulation, has been neglected in the academic literature. This paper reports on a study which examined 135 Amazon reviews of 5 'top-selling' smart devices, concluding that such devices are being used to supplement informal caring, albeit in different ways. The implications of this phenomena are necessary to consider, specifically the consequences for 'caring webs' and expectations about the future role of digital devices within the landscape of informal caring.",2023,,Humans; Scotland; Computers; Home Environment,"Reid, L; Sisel, G"

Effect of carbonaceous ultrafine particles on the structure and oligomerization of Aβ,"The impact of pervasive air pollutants on human health is a growing concern in scientific communities. Among different air pollutants, ultrafine particles (UFPs; with aerodynamic diameter <100 nm) might pass through biological barriers and have a severe impact on human health, including early progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). A significant fraction of UFPs consists of carbonaceous compounds, composed of elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC). While in-vivo experimental studies showed the neurotoxicity of typical OC and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the molecular interactions involved in the progression of AD remain unclear. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the impact of carbonaceous UFPs on the structure of the Aβ",2023,Alzheimer's diseases; Amyloid beta peptide; Carbonaceous ultrafine particles; Environmental nanotoxicology; Oligomerization; Protein structure,Humans; Particulate Matter; Air Pollutants; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Carbon,"Kaumbekova, S; Amouei Torkmahalleh, M; Umezawa, M; Wang, Y; Shah, D"
Data-driven neuropathological staging and subtyping of TDP-43 proteinopathies.,"TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) accumulation is the primary pathology underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Charting the progression and heterogeneity of TDP-43 accumulation is necessary to better characterise TDP-43 proteinopathies, but current TDP-43 staging systems are heuristic and assume each syndrome is homogeneous. Here, we use data-driven disease progression modelling to derive a fine-grained empirical staging system for the classification and differentiation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP, n=126), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n=141) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) with and without Alzheimerâ€™s disease (n=304). The data-driven staging of ALS and FTLD-TDP complement and extend previously described human-defined staging schema for ALS and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In LATE-NC individuals, progression along data-driven stages was positively associated with age, but negatively associated with age in individuals with FTLD-TDP. Using only regional TDP-43 severity, our data driven model distinguished individuals diagnosed with ALS, FTLD-TDP or LATE-NC with a cross-validated accuracy of 85.9%, with misclassifications associated with mixed pathological diagnosis, age and genetic mutations. Adding age and SuStaIn stage to this model increased accuracy to 92.3%. Our model differentiates LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP, though some overlap was observed between late-stage LATE-NC and early-stage FTLD-TDP. We further tested for the presence of subtypes with distinct regional TDP-43 progression patterns within each diagnostic group, identifying two distinct cortical-predominant and brainstem-predominant subtypes within FTLD-TDP and a further two subcortical-predominant and corticolimbic-predominant subtypes within ALS. The FTLD-TDP subtypes exhibited differing proportions of TDP-43 type, while there was a trend for age differing between ALS subtypes. Interestingly, a negative relationship between age and SuStaIn stage was seen in the brainstem/subcortical-predominant subtype of each proteinopathy. No subtypes were observed for the LATE-NC group, despite aggregating AD+ and AD-individuals and a larger sample size for this group. Overall, we provide an empirical pathological TDP-43 staging system for ALS, FTLD-TDP and LATE-NC, which yielded accurate classification. We further demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity amongst ALS and FTLD-TDP progression patterns that warrants further investigation in larger cross-cohort studies.",2023,,,"Young, AL; Vogel, JW; Robinson, JL; McMillan, CT; Ossenkoppele, R; Wolk, DA; Irwin, DJ; Elman, L; Grossman, M; Lee, VM; Lee, EB; Hansson, O"

Aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,"Aducanumab is a novel disease-modifying anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) human monoclonal antibody specifically targeted to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was granted for treating AD in June 2021 by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We systematically analyzed available trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab treating AD. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. We conducted an extensive literature search using the electronic databases MEDLINE through PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for suitable studies on aducanumab. We considered human clinical trials of aducanumab, assessing its efficacy and adverse effects in treating AD, excluding any experimental animal studies. We included three randomised controlled trials. Studies reported that aducanumab reduced brain amyloid-beta plaques in a time- and dose-dependent manner (dose-response, P < 0.05) and a slowed decline in cognition (22% reduction) in the high-dose treated group, difference of -0.39 versus placebo in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum Boxes (95% CI, -0.69 to -0.09; P = 0.012) along with a reduced amyloid positron emission tomography standard uptake value ratio score (P < 0.001) and plasma p181-tau (phosphorylated tau) level. Amyloid-related imaging abnormality was reported as a serious adverse event and was profound in high-dose treated group (425/1029 in 10 mg/kg). Aducanumab has been reported to affect two main pathophysiologic hallmarks (Aβ and tau) of AD.

Barriers and Enablers for the Use of Digital Interactive Television in Nursing Home Settings: An Interview Case Study with Older Adults and Professionals.,"Increasingly, public health programs are recommending the use of information and communication technologies to address the psychosocial needs of Older Adults (OAs). Recently, several applications that allow access to communication and stimulation functionalities using digital interactive television (DiTV) have been developed. The use of the television interface to access digital services seems to help meet several accessibility and usability needs of OAs. However, its use entails other challenges related to different dimensions (organizational, technological, ethical, etc.). This study aims to identify the factors that enable or hinder the use of DiTV by OAs living in geriatric institutions. A qualitative interview case study was conducted in three French geriatric facilities. A total of 25 semi-structured interviews were carried out with residents and care professionals, between February and April 2022, to identify enablers and barriers to DiTV use. Data were processed using a thematic deductive analysis inspired by a multidimensional Health Technology Assessment model. The analysis showed that DiTV use may be limited by organizational (e.g., workload), technological (e.g., ergonomic issues), human (e.g., health issues), ethical (e.g., privacy), and safety factors (e.g., frustration due to technical problems). A summary of these factors and five recommendations for DiTV implementation in geriatric settings are presented in this paper.",2023,digital interactive television; geriatric institutions; health technology assessment; older adults; usability,Humans; Aged; Communication; Nursing Homes; Technology; Qualitative Research; Television,"Naudé, B; Rigaud, AS; Kamali, L; Pino, M"

"Aqueous extract of Ceratonia siliqua L. leaves elicits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and AChE inhibiting effects in amyloid-β42-induced cognitive deficit mice: Role of α7-nAChR in modulating Jak2/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin cascade.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder attributed to several etiological factors including cholinergic dysregulation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, β-amyloidogenesis, and tauopathy. This demands the search for multitarget drugs, especially of natural sources owing to their pleiotropic activities and low adverse effects. The present study was conducted to investigate the cognitive-improving potential of Ceratonia siliqua L. (Cs) extract compared with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on AD-like pathological alterations induced by single intracerebroventricular amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) injection in mice. Aβ42-injected mice were treated with Cs (100 mg/kg/day, po) with or without methyllycaconitine (MLA; 1 mg/kg/day, ip), an α7-nAChR antagonist. Aβ42-injected animals demonstrated an elevation of hippocampal Aβ42, p-Tau, and acetylcholinesterase. They also showed a decline in phosphorylated levels of Jak2, PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β, leading to induction of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Noteworthy, Cs improved the histopathological and behavioral variables in addition to mitigating AD hallmarks. It also exerted neuroprotection by reducing NF-κBp65 and TNF-α, while elevating Nrf2 and HO-1, along with stabilizing β-catenin under the impact of Jak2/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling. These beneficial effects of Cs were abrogated by MLA co-administration signifying the α7-nAChR involvement in Cs-mediated effects. Therefore, Cs can ameliorate Aβ42-induced neurodegeneration by modulating Jak2/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin axis in an α7-nAChR-dependent manner.",2023,Ceratonia siliqua L.; PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β; amyloid-β; mice; α7-nAChR; β-catenin,Mice; Animals; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Antioxidants; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Neuroinflammatory Diseases; beta Catenin; Acetylcholinesterase; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Cognition,"El Sayed, NS; Abidar, S; Nhiri, M; Hritcu, L; Ibrahim, WW"

Digital Intervention For The Management Of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial, chronic, neurodegenerative disease with high prevalence and limited therapeutic options, making it a global health crisis. Being the most common cause of dementia, AD erodes the cognitive, functional, and social abilities of the individual and causes escalating medical and psychosocial needs. As yet, this disorder has no cure and current treatment options are palliative in nature. There is an urgent need for novel therapy to address this pressing challenge. Digital therapeutics (Dtx) is one such novel therapy that is gaining popularity globally. Dtx provides evidence based therapeutic interventions driven by internet and software, employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames, apps, sensors, virtual reality aiding in the prevention, management, and treatment of ailments like neurological abnormalities and chronic diseases. Dtx acts as a supportive tool for the optimization of patient care, individualized treatment and improved health outcomes. Dtx uses visual, sound and other non-invasive approaches for instance-consistent therapy, reminiscence therapy, computerised cognitive training, semantic and phonological assistance devices, wearables and computer-assisted rehabilitation environment to find applications in Alzheimer's disease for improving memory, cognition, functional abilities and managing motor symptom. A few of the Dtx-based tools employed in AD include ""Memory Matters"", ""AlzSense"", ""Alzheimer Assistant"", ""smart robotic dog"", ""Immersive virtual reality (iVR)"" and the most current gamma stimulation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current trends in digital health in AD and explore the benefits, challenges, and impediments of using Dtx as an adjunctive therapy for the management of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s Disease; Dementia; Digital health.; Internet of things; Mobile apps; Reminiscence therapy,,"Manchanda, N; Aggarwal, A; Setya, S; Talegaonkar, S"

Discovery of dual PKS involved in sclerotiorin biosynthesis in Penicillium meliponae using genome mining and gene knockout.,"Fungi of the genus Penicillium section Sclerotiora have as their main characteristic the presence of orange-pigmented mycelium, which is associated with sclerotiorin, a chlorinated secondary metabolite of the azaphilone subclass of polyketides. Sclerotiorin presents anti-diabetes, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-Alzheimer, antiviral, and antimicrobial activities, which has always attracted the attention of researchers worldwide. During our ongoing search for azaphilone-producing Amazonian fungi, the strain of Penicillium MMSRG-058 was isolated as an endophyte from the roots of Duguetia stelechantha and showed great capacity for producing sclerotiorin-like metabolites. Using multilocus phylogeny, this strain was identified as Penicillium meliponae. Moreover, based on the genome mining of this strain through the reverse approach, a cluster of putative biosynthetic genes (BGC) responsible for the biosynthesis of sclerotiorin-like metabolites (scl cluster) was identified. The knockout of the sclA (highly reducing PKS) and sclI (non-reducing PKS) genes resulted in mutants with loss of mycelial pigmentation and terminated the biosynthesis of sclerotiorin-like metabolites: geumsanol B, chlorogeumsanol B, 7-deacetylisochromophilone VI, isochromophilone VI, ochrephilone, isorotiorin, and sclerotiorin. Based on these results, a biosynthetic pathway was proposed considering the homology of BGC scl genes with the azaphilone BGCs that have already been functionally characterized.",2023,Fungal BGC; Natural products; Penicillium meliponae; Polyketides,Gene Knockout Techniques; Penicillium; Fungi; Multigene Family,"Sousa, TF; de Araújo Júnior, MB; Peres, EG; Souza, MP; da Silva, FMA; de Medeiros, LS; de Souza, ADL; de Souza, AQL; Yamagishi, MEB; da Silva, GF; Koolen, HHF; De Queiroz, MV"

Preanalytic variable effects on segmentation and quantification machine learning algorithms for amyloid-β analyses on digitized human brain slides.,"Computational machine learning (ML)-based frameworks could be advantageous for scalable analyses in neuropathology. A recent deep learning (DL) framework has shown promise in automating the processes of visualizing and quantifying different types of amyloid-β deposits as well as segmenting white matter (WM) from gray matter (GM) on digitized immunohistochemically stained slides. However, this framework has only been trained and evaluated on amyloid-β-stained slides with minimal changes in preanalytic variables. In this study, we evaluated select preanalytical variables including magnification, compression rate, and storage format using three digital slides scanners (Zeiss Axioscan Z1, Leica Aperio AT2, and Leica Aperio GT 450), on over 60 whole slide images, in a cohort of 14 cases having a spectrum of amyloid-β deposits. We conducted statistical comparisons of preanalytic variables with repeated measures analysis of variance evaluating the outputs of two DL frameworks for segmentation and object classification tasks. For both WM/GM segmentation and amyloid-β plaque classification tasks, there were statistical differences with respect to scanner types (p < 0.05) and magnifications (p < 0.05). Although small numbers of cases were analyzed, this pilot study highlights the significance of preanalytic variables that may alter the performance of ML algorithms.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Amyloid-β; Deep learning; Digital pathology; Machine learning; Slide scanner; Whole slide imaging,"Humans; Algorithms; Brain; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Pilot Projects","Oliveira, LC; Lai, Z; Harvey, D; Nzenkue, K; Jin, LW; Decarli, C; Chuah, CN; Dugger, BN"
The status of digital pathology and associated infrastructure within Alzheimer's Disease Centers.,"Digital pathology (DP) has transformative potential, especially for Alzheimer disease and related disorders. However, infrastructure barriers may limit adoption. To provide benchmarks and insights into implementation barriers, a survey was conducted in 2019 within National Institutes of Health's Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs). Questions covered infrastructure, funding sources, and data management related to digital pathology. Of the 35 ADCs to which the survey was sent, 33 responded. Most respondents (81%) stated that their ADC had digital slide scanner access, with the most frequent brand being Aperio/Leica (62.9%). Approximately a third of respondents stated there were fees to utilize the scanner. For DP and machine learning (ML) resources, 41% of respondents stated none was supported by their ADC. For scanner purchasing and operations, 50% of respondents stated they received institutional support. Some were unsure of the file size of scanned digital images (37%) and total amount of storage space files occupied (50%). Most (76%) were aware of other departments at their institution working with ML; a similar (76%) percentage were unaware of multiuniversity or industry partnerships.

The foundation and architecture of precision medicine in neurology and psychiatry.,"Neurological and psychiatric diseases have high degrees of genetic and pathophysiological heterogeneity, irrespective of clinical manifestations. Traditional medical paradigms have focused on late-stage syndromic aspects of these diseases, with little consideration of the underlying biology. Advances in disease modeling and methodological design have paved the way for the development of precision medicine (PM), an established concept in oncology with growing attention from other medical specialties. We propose a PM architecture for central nervous system diseases built on four converging pillars: multimodal biomarkers, systems medicine, digital health technologies, and data science. We discuss Alzheimer's disease (AD), an area of significant unmet medical need, as a case-in-point for the proposed framework. AD can be seen as one of the most advanced PM-oriented disease models and as a compelling catalyzer towards PM-oriented neuroscience drug development and advanced healthcare practice.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; biomedical research; data science; digital health; systems medicine,Humans; Precision Medicine; Alzheimer Disease; Neurology; Neurosciences; Psychiatry,"Hampel, H; Gao, P; Cummings, J; Toschi, N; Thompson, PM; Hu, Y; Cho, M; Vergallo, A"

Functional Correlates of Striatal Dopamine Transporter Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels in Alzheimer's Disease: A Preliminary ,"The aim of our study was to investigate regional glucose metabolism with 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography in a population of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in relation to cerebrospinal (CSF) levels of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT). All patients underwent lumbar puncture and received a biomarker-based diagnosis of AD. Differences in regional brain glucose metabolism were assessed by Statistical Parametric Mapping version 12 with the use of age, gender, and MMSE as covariates in the analysis. A positive correlation between CSF DAT levels and glucose metabolism at the level of two brain areas involved in the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease, the substantia nigra and the posterior cingulate gyrus, has been highlighted. Results indicate that patients with higher CSF DAT levels have a better metabolic pattern in two key zones, suggesting less advanced disease status in patients with more conserved dopaminergic systems.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; DAT; FDG-PET; dementia; dopaminergic impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Positron-Emission Tomography; Brain; Glucose,"Camedda, R; Bonomi, CG; Di Donna, MG; Chiaravalloti, A"

Automated hemodynamic assessment for cranial 4D flow MRI.,"Cranial 4D flow MRI post-processing typically involves manual user interaction which is time-consuming and associated with poor repeatability. The primary goal of this study is to develop a robust quantitative velocity tool (QVT) that utilizes threshold-based segmentation techniques to improve segmentation quality over prior approaches based on centerline processing schemes (CPS) that utilize k-means clustering segmentation. This tool also includes an interactive 3D display designed for simplified vessel selection and automated hemodynamic visualization and quantification. The performances of QVT and CPS were compared in vitro in a flow phantom and in vivo in 10 healthy participants. Vessel segmentations were compared with ground-truth computed tomography in vitro (29 locations) and manual segmentation in vivo (13 locations) using linear regression. Additionally, QVT and CPS MRI flow rates were compared to perivascular ultrasound flow in vitro using linear regression. To assess internal consistency of flow measures in vivo, conservation of flow was assessed at vessel junctions using linear regression and consistency of flow along vessel segments was analyzed by fitting a Gaussian distribution to a histogram of normalized flow values. Post-processing times were compared between the QVT and CPS using paired t-tests. Vessel areas segmented in vitro (CPS: slope = 0.71, r = 0.95 and QVT: slope = 1.03, r = 0.95) and in vivo (CPS: slope = 0.61, r = 0.96 and QVT: slope = 0.93, r = 0.96) were strongly correlated with ground-truth area measurements. However, CPS (using k-means segmentation) consistently underestimated vessel areas. Strong correlations were observed between QVT and ultrasound flow (slope = 0.98, r = 0.96) as well as flow at junctions (slope = 1.05, r = 0.98). Mean and standard deviation of flow along vessel segments was 9.33e-16 ± 3.05%. Additionally, the QVT demonstrated excellent interobserver agreement and significantly reduced post-processing by nearly 10 min (p < 0.001). By completely automating post-processing and providing an easy-to-use 3D visualization interface for interactive vessel selection and hemodynamic quantification, the QVT offers an efficient, robust, and repeatable means to analyze cranial 4D flow MRI.

Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers with Crossmodal Augmentation.,"Mild cognitive impairment is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. Its detection has been a critical task for establishing cohort studies and developing therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's. Various types of markers have been developed for detection. For example, imaging markers from neuroimaging have shown great sensitivity, while its cost is still prohibitive for large-scale screening of early dementia. Recent advances from digital biomarkers, such as language markers, have provided an accessible and affordable alternative. While imaging markers give anatomical descriptions of the brain, language markers capture the behavior characteristics of early dementia subjects. Such differences suggest the benefits of auxiliary information from the imaging modality to improve the predictive power of unimodal predictive models based on language markers alone. However, one significant barrier to the joint analysis is that in typical cohorts, there are only very limited subjects that have both imaging and language modalities. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we develop a novel crossmodal augmentation tool, which leverages auxiliary imaging information to improve the feature space of language markers so that a subject with only language markers can benefit from imaging information through the augmentation. Our experimental results show that the multi-modal predictive model trained with language markers and auxiliary imaging information significantly outperforms unimodal predictive models.",2023,,Humans; Computational Biology; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Neuroimaging; Language; Disease Progression,"Liu, G; Xue, Z; Zhan, L; Dodge, HH; Zhou, J"
The Independent Walking for Brain Health Intervention for Older Adults: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Extensive research suggests that physical activity (PA) is important for brain and cognitive health and may help to delay or prevent Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Most PA interventions designed to improve brain health in older adults have been conducted in laboratory, gym, or group settings that require extensive resources and travel to the study site or group sessions. Research is needed to develop novel interventions that leverage mobile health (mHealth) technologies to help older adults increase their engagement in PA in free-living environments, reducing participant burden and increasing generalizability of research findings. Moreover, promoting engagement in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) may be most beneficial to brain health; thus, using mHealth to help older adults increase time spent in MVPA in free-living environments may help to offset the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and improve quality of life in older age.",2023,adaptive intervention; brain perfusion; clinical trial; cognition; digital health; exercise; feasibility; mechanisms; older adults; real time; real world; seniors,,"Hays Weeks, CC; Moore, AA; Allison, M; Patrick, K; Bondi, MW; Nebeker, C; Liu, TT; Wing, D; Higgins, M; Hartman, SJ; Rissman, RA; Zlatar, ZZ"
The effect of a digital health coaching and health education protocol on cognition in adults at-risk for Alzheimer's.,"Several modifiable lifestyle factors have been linked to cognitive ability and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Health coaching (HC) is an intervention that addresses lifestyle factors associated with cognition. The effectiveness of an HC protocol was evaluated and compared with a health education (HE) intervention, representing the current standard of care, in a sample of 216 adults between the ages of 45 and 75 years who were at-risk for developing ADRD. Outcomes examined were global cognition, neuropsychological cognition, and Alzheimer's risk. HC participants received personalized coaching from a health coach focusing on nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, social engagement, and cognitive activity. HE participants received biweekly education materials focusing on the same modifiable lifestyle factors addressed by HC. Participants were assessed at baseline and again 4 months later. Self-reported global cognition scores improved only in the HC group (16.18 to 15.52, p = .03) and neuropsychological cognitive ability improved in the HE group (104.48 to 108.76, p < .001). When non-adherence in the HC group was accounted for, however, the mean change in neuropsychological score was similar between groups (p > .05), self-reported global cognition demonstrated an even larger mean improvement in the HC group (16.20 to 15.41, p = .01), and the HC group saw an improvement in ADRD protective risk score (- 10.39 to - 11.45, p = .007). These results indicate that HC and HE can both improve cognition, but HC may be more effective and may yield increased protection against ADRD risk.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Alzheimer’s risk; Cognition; Health coaching,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Mentoring; Cognition; Life Style; Health Education,"Campitelli, A; Gills, JL; Jones, MD; Paulson, S; Myers, J; Bryk, K; Madero, EN; Glenn, JM; Rodgers, CH; Kempkes, JA; Gray, M"
Distributional data analysis via quantile functions and its application to modeling digital biomarkers of gait in Alzheimer's Disease.,"With the advent of continuous health monitoring with wearable devices, users now generate their unique streams of continuous data such as minute-level step counts or heartbeats. Summarizing these streams via scalar summaries often ignores the distributional nature of wearable data and almost unavoidably leads to the loss of critical information. We propose to capture the distributional nature of wearable data via user-specific quantile functions (QF) and use these QFs as predictors in scalar-on-quantile-function-regression (SOQFR). As an alternative approach, we also propose to represent QFs via user-specific L-moments, robust rank-based analogs of traditional moments, and use L-moments as predictors in SOQFR (SOQFR-L). These two approaches provide two mutually consistent interpretations: in terms of quantile levels by SOQFR and in terms of L-moments by SOQFR-L. We also demonstrate how to deal with multi-modal distributional data via Joint and Individual Variation Explained using L-moments. The proposed methods are illustrated in a study of association of digital gait biomarkers with cognitive function in Alzheimers disease. Our analysis shows that the proposed methods demonstrate higher predictive performance and attain much stronger associations with clinical cognitive scales compared to simple distributional summaries.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Gait; JIVE; L-Moments; Quantile functions; Scalar-on-quantile-function regression; Wearable data,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Gait; Wearable Electronic Devices; Data Analysis,"Ghosal, R; Varma, VR; Volfson, D; Hillel, I; Urbanek, J; Hausdorff, JM; Watts, A; Zipunnikov, V"

Emulate randomized clinical trials using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation for personalized treatments: Methodology review and benchmark.,"Big data and (deep) machine learning have been ambitious tools in digital medicine, but these tools focus mainly on association. Intervention in medicine is about the causal effects. The average treatment effect has long been studied as a measure of causal effect, assuming that all populations have the same effect size. However, no ""one-size-fits-all"" treatment seems to work in some complex diseases. Treatment effects may vary by patient. Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) may have a high impact on developing personalized treatment. Lots of advanced machine learning models for estimating HTE have emerged in recent years, but there has been limited translational research into the real-world healthcare domain. To fill the gap, we reviewed and compared eleven recent HTE estimation methodologies, including meta-learner, representation learning models, and tree-based models. We performed a comprehensive benchmark experiment based on nationwide healthcare claim data with application to Alzheimer's disease drug repurposing. We provided some challenges and opportunities in HTE estimation analysis in the healthcare domain to close the gap between innovative HTE models and deployment to real-world healthcare problems.",2023,Causal inference; Conditional average treatment effect; Deep learning; Drug development; Machine learning; Target trial,Humans; Benchmarking; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Causality; Machine Learning,"Ling, Y; Upadhyaya, P; Chen, L; Jiang, X; Kim, Y"

Adult sigmoidorectal intussusception as an unexpected cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.,"A 95-years-old woman presented with sudden-onset rectal bleeding. All other systems were reviewed and were negative. The patient had a past medical history of Alzheimer disease, congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. Vital signs were normal. There were neither signs of peritoneal irritation nor intestinal obstruction. On digital rectal examination, a soft mass was palpated about 9 cm from the anal verge. Routine analytical tests were within normal limits. The abdominal CT showed a sigmoidorectal intussusception. It was performed a colonoscopy revealing a segment of sigmoid telescoping into the rectum about 15cm from the anal verge. On this invaginated segment, there was a large sessile polyp, which was biopsied. Rectal bleeding was self-limited without additional measures. The histological examination showed tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Intussusception in the adult is uncommon, representing less than 5% of all cases of intussusception. Most of the cases are due to malignant lesions, which are pulled forward during peristalsis, leading to invagination.

Improving generalizability and study design of Alzheimer's disease cohort studies in the United States by including under-represented populations.,"The poor generalizability of clinical research data due to the enrollment of highly educated, non-Latinx White participants hampers the development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Black and Latinx older adults have a greater risk for dementia, yet it is unclear how health-care disparities and sociocultural factors influence potential AD therapies and prognosis. Low enrollment of under-represented populations may be attributable to several factors including greater exclusion due to higher rates of comorbidities, lower access to AD clinics, and the legacy of unethical treatment in medical research. This perspective outlines solutions tested in the Brain Health Registry (BHR) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including culturally-informed digital research methods, community-engaged research strategies, leadership from under-represented communities, and the reduction of exclusion criteria based on comorbidities.

Transcranial deep-tissue phototherapy for Alzheimer's disease using low-dose X-ray-activated long-afterglow scintillators.,"Non-invasive phototherapy has been emerging as an ambitious tactic for suppression of amyloid-β (Aβ) self-assembly against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains a daunting challenge to develop efficient photosensitizers for Aβ oxygenation that are activatable in a deep brain tissue through the scalp and skull, while reducing side effects on normal tissues. Here, we report an Aβ targeted, low-dose X-ray-excitable long-afterglow scintillator (ScNPs@RB/Ab) for efficient deep-brain phototherapy. We demonstrate that the as-synthesized ScNPs@RB/Ab is capable of converting X-rays into visible light to activate the photosensitizers of rose bengal (RB) for Aβ oxygenation through the scalp and skull. We show that the ScNPs@RB/Ab persistently emitting visible luminescence can substantially minimize the risk of excessive X-ray exposure dosage. Importantly, peptide KLVFFAED-functionalized ScNPs@RB/Ab shows a blood-brain barrier permeability. In vivo experimental results validated that ScNPs@RB/Ab alleviated Aβ burden and slowed cognitive decline in triple-transgenic AD model mice at extremely low X-ray doses without side effects. Our study paves a new pathway to develop high-efficiency transcranial AD phototherapy.

Lycopene: Sojourn from kitchen to an effective therapy in Alzheimer's disease.,"Reports on a significant positive correlation between consumption of carotenoid-rich food and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) led to the investigation of carotenoids for the treatment and prevention of AD. More than 1100 types of carotenoids are found naturally, out of which only around 50 are absorbed and metabolized in human body. Lycopene is one of the most commonly ingested members of fat-soluble carotenoid family that gives vegetables and fruits their red, yellow, or orange color. Lycopene has established itself as a promising therapy for AD owing to its neuroprotective activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiamyloidogenic properties. In this review, we highlight the various in vitro and preclinical studies demonstrating the neuroprotective effect of lycopene. Also, some epidemiological and interventional studies investigating the protective effect of lycopene in AD have been discussed. Diving deeper, we also discuss various significant mechanisms, through which lycopene exerts its remissive effects in AD. Finally, to overcome the issue of poor chemical stability and bioavailability of lycopene, some of the novel delivery systems developed for lycopene have also been briefly highlighted.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; lycopene; neuroinflammation; neuroprotective; oxidative stress,Humans; Lycopene; Alzheimer Disease; Carotenoids; Antioxidants,"Kapoor, B; Gulati, M; Rani, P; Kochhar, RS; Atanasov, AG; Gupta, R; Sharma, D; Kapoor, D"

Why a clinical trial is as good as its outcome measure: A framework for the selection and use of cognitive outcome measures for clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease.,"A crucial aspect of any clinical trial is using the right outcome measure to assess treatment efficacy. Compared to the rapidly evolved understanding and measurement of pathophysiology in preclinical and early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), relatively less progress has been made in the evolution of clinical outcome assessments (COAs) for those stages. The current paper aims to provide a benchmark for the design and evaluation of COAs for use in early AD trials. We discuss lessons learned on capturing cognitive changes in predementia stages of AD, including challenges when validating novel COAs for those early stages and necessary evidence for their implementation in clinical trials. Moving forward, we propose a multi-step framework to advance the use of more effective COAs to assess clinically meaningful changes in early AD, which will hopefully contribute to the much-needed consensus around more appropriate outcome measures to assess clinical efficacy of putative treatments. HIGHLIGHTS: We discuss lessons learned on capturing cognitive changes in predementia stages of AD. We propose a framework for the design and evaluation of performance based cognitive tests for use in early AD trials.

Older Adults' Views on Social Interactions and Online Socializing Games - A Qualitative Study.,"Age-related difficulties and quarantine restrictions impede the possibilities to maintain contact with one's social network. Maintaining these contacts may be supported by digital games. To develop effective and feasible digital tools to foster social interaction, we aimed to explore what older adults find important in social contact and what barriers and enablers they foresee in digital gaming interventions as network support aids. Two focus groups and 20 semi-structured interviews (N = 29) with older adults (aged 55-87) were held to explore the research questions. Furthermore, a questionnaire was administered (N = 29) containing measures of loneliness, frailty, and social network size. Participants found 'reciprocity', 'in-person contact', and 'personal connection' important in contact with strong ties. Online games were not used much for socializing but may be used in the future, particularly by less mobile older adults. Future social gaming interventions should be challenging, user-friendly, and offer the possibility to communicate. Digital co-designed interventions that are feasible, challenging, intuitive, and trigger meaningful communication may strengthen social interactions in older adults. They may be a relevant social support tool in periods of interaction limitations due to functional impairment or social isolation.",2023,Social contact; co-design; digital technology; loneliness; qualitative research; social isolation,Humans; Aged; Social Interaction; Social Isolation; Loneliness; Social Behavior; Social Support,"Janssen, JHM; Kremers, EM; Nieuwboer, MS; Châtel, BDL; Corten, R; Olde Rikkert, MGM; Peeters, GMEEG"
Implementation of interprofessional digital communication tools in primary care for frail older adults: An interview study.,"Communication and coordination between primary healthcare professionals and informal caregivers involved in the care for frail older adults is suboptimal and could benefit from interprofessional digital communication tools. Implementation in daily practice however frequently fails. We aim to identify generic barriers and facilitators experienced by healthcare professionals and informal caregivers during implementation of interprofessional communication tools to improve their long-term use. Qualitative content analysis using individual semi-structured interviews was used for evaluating three different digital communication tools used by interprofessional primary care networks for frail older adults by 28 professionals and 10 caregivers. After transcription and open coding, categories and themes were identified. Barriers and facilitators were related to: tool characteristics, context of use, involvement of professionals and caregivers. The tool improved availability, approachability and users' involvement. The large number of digital systems professionals simultaneously use, and different work agreements hampered tool use. The tools facilitated care coordination, and professionals declared to be better informed about patients' current situations. Overall, interprofessional digital communication tools can facilitate communication in networks for primary elderly care. However, integration between digital systems is needed to reduce the number of tools. Organizations and policy makers have an important role in realizing the tools' long-term use.",2023,Care coordination; communication tool; frail elderly; integrated care; interprofessional; qualitative research,Humans; Aged; Frail Elderly; Interprofessional Relations; Caregivers; Communication; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research,"Oostra, DL; Fierkens, C; Alewijnse, MEJ; Olde Rikkert, MGM; Nieuwboer, MS; Perry, M"

Amyloid Beta Peptide-Mediated Alterations in Mitochondrial Dynamics and its Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, compromising cognitive function in patients, with an average incidence of 1-3% in the open population. Protein aggregation into amyloidogenic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as neurodegeneration in the hippocampal and cortical areas, represent the neuropathological hallmarks of this disorder. Mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration include protein misfolding, augmented apoptosis, disrupted molecular signaling pathways and axonal transport, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, among others. It is precisely through a disrupted energy metabolism that neural cells trigger toxic mechanisms leading to cell death. In this regard, the study of mitochondrial dynamics constitutes a relevant topic to decipher the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurological disorders, especially when considering that amyloid-beta peptides can target mitochondria. Specifically, the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, known to accumulate in the brain of AD patients, has been shown to disrupt overall mitochondrial metabolism by impairing energy production, mitochondrial redox activity, and calcium homeostasis, thus highlighting its key role in the AD pathogenesis. In this work, we review and discuss recent evidence supporting the concept that mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by amyloid peptides contributes to the development of AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta-peptide; energy metabolism alterations; mitochondrial function; mitophagy; neurodegeneration; protein aggregation,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Mitochondria,"Monsalvo-Maraver, LÁ; Maya-López, M; Rangel-López, E; Túnez, I; Tinkov, AA; Skalny, A; Ferrer, B; Aschner, M; Santamaría, A"
