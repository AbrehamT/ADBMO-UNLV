Photobiomodulation in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease: state-of-the-art and translational perspectives.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant public health problem, affecting millions of people across the world. Despite decades of research into therapeutic strategies for AD, effective prevention or treatment for this devastating disorder remains elusive. In this review, we discuss the potential of photobiomodulation (PBM) for preventing and alleviating AD-associated pathologies, with a focus on the biological mechanisms underlying this therapy. Future research directions and guidance for clinical practice for this non-invasive and non-pharmacological therapy are also highlighted. The available evidence indicates that different treatment paradigms, including transcranial and systemic PBM, along with the recently proposed remote PBM, all could be promising for AD. PBM exerts diverse biological effects, such as enhancing mitochondrial function, mitigating the neuroinflammation caused by activated glial cells, increasing cerebral perfusion, improving glymphatic drainage, regulating the gut microbiome, boosting myokine production, and modulating the immune system. We suggest that PBM may serve as a powerful therapeutic intervention for AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Experimental models; Neurodegeneration; Photobiomodulation (PBM); Therapy,"Alzheimer Disease; Low-Level Light Therapy; Animals; Humans; Disease Models, Animal; Translational Research, Biomedical","Huang, Z; Hamblin, MR; Zhang, Q"

Single episode of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury leads to chronic neurological deficits and Alzheimer's-like pathological dementia.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the foremost causes of disability and mortality globally. While the scientific and medical emphasis is to save lives and avoid disability during acute period of injury, a severe health problem can manifest years after injury. For instance, TBI increases the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Remote TBI history was reported to be a cause of the accelerated clinical trajectory of Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD) resulting in earlier onset of cognitive impairment and increased AD-associated pathological markers like greater amyloid deposition and cortical thinning. It is not well understood whether a single TBI event may increase the risk of dementia. Moreover, the cellular signaling pathways remain elusive for the chronic effects of TBI on cognition. We have hypothesized that a single TBI induces sustained neuroinflammation and disrupts cellular communication in a way that results later in ADRD pathology. To test this, we induced TBI in young adult CD1 mice and assessed the behavioral outcomes after 11 months followed by pathological, histological, transcriptomic, and MRI assessment. On MRI scans, these mice showed significant loss of tissue, reduced CBF, and higher white matter injury compared to sham mice. We found these brains showed progressive atrophy, markers of ADRD, sustained astrogliosis, loss of neuronal plasticity, and growth factors even after 1-year post-TBI. Because of progressive neurodegeneration, these mice had motor deficits, showed cognitive impairments, and wandered randomly in open field. We, therefore, conclude that progressive pathology after adulthood TBI leads to neurodegenerative conditions such as ADRD and impairs neuronal functions.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (ADRD); Cognitive impairment; Neuropathology; Synapse; TBI; White matter injury,,"Vaibhav, K; Gulhane, M; Ahluwalia, P; Kumar, M; Ahluwalia, M; Rafiq, AM; Amble, V; Zabala, MG; Miller, JB; Goldman, L; Mondal, AK; Deak, F; Kolhe, R; Arbab, AS; Vale, FL"

Systemic inflammation in Aβ,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by memory impairment, neuronal death, and synaptic loss in the hippocampus. Sporadic late-onset AD, which accounts for over 95 % of disease cases, is a multifactorial pathology with complex etiology and pathogenesis. Nowadays, neuroinflammation is considered the third most important component of AD pathogenesis in addition to amyloid peptide generation and deposition. Neuroinflammation is associated with the impairment of blood-brain barrier and leakage of inflammatory mediators into the periphery with developing systemic inflammatory responses. Systemic inflammation is currently considered one of the therapeutic targets for AD treatment, that necessitates in-depth study of this phenomenon in appropriate non-transgenic animal models. This study was aimed to explore systemic inflammatory manifestations in rats with Aβ",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Anemia of inflammation; Circulating phagocytes; Cognitive flexibility; Spatial memory; Systemic inflammation,"Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Disease Models, Animal; Inflammation; Male; Peptide Fragments; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Spatial Memory; Neuroinflammatory Diseases","Nefodova, A; Rudyk, M; Dovhyi, R; Dovbynchuk, T; Dzubenko, N; Tolstanova, G; Skivka, L"

Healthcare Awareness Profile Interview: Development of a new evidence-based brief clinical tool to assess awareness in people with dementia.,"People with dementia vary in awareness of difficulties. Evaluating awareness could facilitate personalized care. However, current research measures are unsuitable for practical clinical application. We aimed to develop a brief multidimensional awareness interview for clinical use. Informed by available evidence about awareness of dementia, items suitable for both in-person and remote administration were modified from validated measures or developed for clinical application. The interview was administered via telephone or videoconference to 31 community-dwelling people with mild-to-moderate dementia. An informant completed a corresponding questionnaire. A multidimensional profile of awareness was created using self-report of symptoms, and discrepancies between self-rating and either informant rating or objective memory task performance. Feedback from participants and informants and discussions with clinical advisory and patient and public involvement groups helped finalize the interview. Remote administration was straightforward taking on average under 11 min. Awareness profiles showed a spectrum of awareness across domains. Feedback indicated that the items were acceptable and understandable. Certain aspects could be mildly upsetting where current difficulties were highlighted. Subject to further validation, the Healthcare Awareness Profile Interview (HAPI) shows potential as an evidence-based brief clinical tool for assessing awareness in people with mild-to-moderate dementia.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Anosognosia; Insight; Measure development; Post-diagnostic support,,"Alexander, CM; Martyr, A; Clare, L"

"Understanding the complex interplay between tau, amyloid and the network in the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's Disease.","It is well known that Aβ and tau proteins are deposited stereotypically in brain regions to cause Alzheimer's disease. The interaction of amyloid and tau in neurodegenerative diseases is a central feature and key to understanding AD pathophysiology. However their mechanisms are controversial, and many aspects do not fit current theories that rely on cell-autonomous factors. While cell culture and animal studies point to various interaction mechanisms between amyloid and tau, their causal direction and mode (local, remote or network-mediated) remain unknown in human subjects. Further, cross-protein interaction is yet to be reconciled with canonical observations that the two species do not co-localize significantly either in space or in time, and do not target the same neuronal populations. To answer these questions quantitatively, in this study we employed a mathematical reaction-diffusion model encoding the biophysical mechanisms underlying self-assembly, trans-neuronal network propagation and enzymtic cross-species coupling of amyloid and tau. We first established that the spatiotemporal evolution of theoretical tau and Aβ correctly predicts empirical patterns of regional Aβ, tau and atrophy. Remarkably, the introduction of a 1-way Aβ→tau interaction was critical to the models' success. In comparison, both the non-interacting and the 2-way interaction models were significantly worse. We also found that network-mediated spread is essential; alternative modes of spread involving proximity or fiber length fare much worse. This mathematical exposition of the ""pas de deux"" of co-evolving proteins provides crucial quantitative and whole-brain support to the concept of amyloid-facilitated-tauopathy rather than the classic amyloid-cascade or pure-tau hypotheses, and helps explain certain known but poorly understood aspects of AD.",2024,,,"Raj, A; Torok, J"

Extracellular vesicles: Mediators of microenvironment in hypoxia-associated neurological diseases.,"Hypoxia is a prevalent characteristic of numerous neurological disorders including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are minute particles released by cells that contain diverse biological materials, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. They have been implicated in a range of physiological and pathological processes including intercellular communication, immune responses, and disease progression. EVs are believed to play a pivotal role in modulating the microenvironment of hypoxia-associated neurological diseases. These EVs are capable of transporting hypoxia-inducible factors such as proteins and microRNAs to neighboring or remote cells, thereby influencing their behavior. Furthermore, EVs can traverse the blood-brain barrier, shielding the brain from detrimental substances in the bloodstream. This enables them to deliver their payload directly to the brain cells, potentially intensifying the effects of hypoxia. Nonetheless, the capacity of EVs to breach the blood-brain barrier presents new opportunities for drug delivery. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of EVs as mediators of information exchange during tissue hypoxia, a pathophysiological process in ischemic stroke and malignant gliomas. We also investigated their involvement in the progression and regression of major diseases of the central nervous system, which are pertinent to the development of therapeutic interventions for neurological disorders.",2024,Extracellular vesicles; Hypoxia; Neurological disorders,Humans; Extracellular Vesicles; Nervous System Diseases; Hypoxia; Blood-Brain Barrier; Animals,"Yang, H; Niu, L; Jia, J; Liang, W; Li, Q; Pan, Y"

Open Meter Duo: Low-Cost Instrument for Fluorimetric Determination of Cholinesterase Activity.,"Environmental screening is essential due to the increased occurrence of harmful substances in the environment. Open Meter Duo (OMD) is an open-source field photo/fluorimeter that uses an RGB diode that imitates a color according to the selected wavelength and uses a UV LED from the security kit diode as an excitation light source. The prepared PCB shield with a 3D-printed aperture was connected to Arduino UNO R4 WiFi. This system was used for the fluorescent detection of cholinesterase activity with the indoxyl acetate method. Carbofuran-a toxic pesticide-and donepezil-a drug used to treat Alzheimer's disease-were tested as model inhibitors of cholinesterase activity. The limit of detection of indoxyl acetate was 11.6 μmol/L, and the IC50 values of the inhibitors were evaluated. This system is optimized for wireless use in field analysis with added cloud support and power source. The time of analysis was 5 min for the fluorimetric assay and 20 min for the optional photometric assay. The time of field operation was approximately 4 h of continuous measurement. This system is ready to be used as a cheap and easy control platform for portable use in drug control and point-of-care testing.",2024,3D printing; Arduino; cholinesterase; fluorimetry; low cost; portable; remote sensing,Humans; Fluorometry; Donepezil; Alzheimer Disease; Cholinesterases; Cholinesterase Inhibitors,"Keresteš, O; Mozo, JD; Pohanka, M"
Randomized controlled trial of a positive emotion regulation intervention to reduce stress in family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease: protocol and design for the LEAF 2.0 study.,"Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease can be stressful, resulting in poorer emotional and physical health among family caregivers. Although supportive resources for caregivers are available, distance, caregiver health, and the daily demands of caregiving are barriers to access. Based on research demonstrating the importance of positive emotions in coping with stress, our previous trial showed that dementia caregivers who participated in facilitated, web-based delivery of a positive emotion regulation intervention called LEAF (Life Enhancing Activities for Family caregivers) experienced increased positive emotion and decreased depression and anxiety. Building on this evidence, the LEAF 2.0 study aims to test whether web-based, self-guided delivery can confer similar benefits for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Coping; Dementia caregiving; Positive affect; Randomized controlled trial; Stress,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Caregivers; Quality of Life; Emotional Regulation; Emotions; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,"Leong, CA; Summers, A; Grote, V; Jackson, K; Dowling, G; Snowberg, K; Cotten, P; Cheung, E; Yang, D; Addington, EL; Moskowitz, JT"
A remote digital memory composite to detect cognitive impairment in memory clinic samples in unsupervised settings using mobile devices.,"Remote monitoring of cognition holds the promise to facilitate case-finding in clinical care and the individual detection of cognitive impairment in clinical and research settings. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this is particularly relevant for patients who seek medical advice due to memory problems. Here, we develop a remote digital memory composite (RDMC) score from an unsupervised remote cognitive assessment battery focused on episodic memory and long-term recall and assess its construct validity, retest reliability, and diagnostic accuracy when predicting MCI-grade impairment in a memory clinic sample and healthy controls. A total of 199 participants were recruited from three cohorts and included as healthy controls (n = 97), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 59), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 43). Participants performed cognitive assessments in a fully remote and unsupervised setting via a smartphone app. The derived RDMC score is significantly correlated with the PACC5 score across participants and demonstrates good retest reliability. Diagnostic accuracy for discriminating memory impairment from no impairment is high (cross-validated AUC = 0.83, 95% CI [0.66, 0.99]) with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.72. Thus, unsupervised remote cognitive assessments implemented in the neotiv digital platform show good discrimination between cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, further demonstrating that it is feasible to complement the neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory with unsupervised and remote assessments on mobile devices. This contributes to recent efforts to implement remote assessment of episodic memory for case-finding and monitoring in large research studies and clinical care.",2024,,,"Berron, D; Glanz, W; Clark, L; Basche, K; Grande, X; Güsten, J; Billette, OV; Hempen, I; Naveed, MH; Diersch, N; Butryn, M; Spottke, A; Buerger, K; Perneczky, R; Schneider, A; Teipel, S; Wiltfang, J; Johnson, S; Wagner, M; Jessen, F; Düzel, E"

CK2 negatively regulates the extinction of remote fear memory.,"Cognitive behavioral therapy, rooted in exposure therapy, is currently the primary approach employed in the treatment of anxiety-related conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In laboratory settings, fear extinction in animals is a commonly employed technique to investigate exposure therapy; however, the precise mechanisms underlying fear extinction remain elusive. Casein kinase 2 (CK2), which regulates neuroplasticity via phosphorylation of its substrates, has a significant influence in various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as in the process of learning and memory. In this study, we adopted a classical Pavlovian fear conditioning model to investigate the involvement of CK2 in remote fear memory extinction and its underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that the activity of CK2 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice was significantly upregulated after extinction training of remote cued fear memory. Notably, administration of the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 prior to extinction training facilitated the extinction of remote fear memory. In addition, CX-4945 significantly upregulated the expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-CREB in the mPFC. Our results suggest that CK2 negatively regulates remote fear memory extinction, at least in part, by inhibiting the ERK-CREB pathway. These findings contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of remote cued fear extinction, thereby offering a theoretical foundation and identifying potential targets for the intervention and treatment of PTSD.",2024,CK2; CX-4945; Fear extinction; MPFC; Remote memory,"Animals; Mice; Casein Kinase II; Conditioning, Classical; Extinction, Psychological; Fear; Prefrontal Cortex; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","Yang, J; Lin, L; Zou, GJ; Wang, LF; Li, F; Li, CQ; Cui, YH; Huang, FL"

Machine Learning and Digital Biomarkers Can Detect Early Stages of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are devastating conditions that can develop without noticeable symptoms, causing irreversible damage to neurons before any signs become clinically evident. NDs are a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Currently, there are no cures or treatments to halt their progression. Therefore, the development of early detection methods is urgently needed to delay neuronal loss as soon as possible. Despite advancements in Medtech, the early diagnosis of NDs remains a challenge at the intersection of medical, IT, and regulatory fields. Thus, this review explores ""digital biomarkers"" (tools designed for remote neurocognitive data collection and AI analysis) as a potential solution. The review summarizes that recent studies combining AI with digital biomarkers suggest the possibility of identifying pre-symptomatic indicators of NDs. For instance, research utilizing convolutional neural networks for eye tracking has achieved significant diagnostic accuracies. ROC-AUC scores reached up to 0.88, indicating high model performance in differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls. Similarly, advancements in facial expression analysis through tools have demonstrated significant potential in detecting emotional changes in ND patients, with some models reaching an accuracy of 0.89 and a precision of 0.85. This review follows a structured approach to article selection, starting with a comprehensive database search and culminating in a rigorous quality assessment and meaning for NDs of the different methods. The process is visualized in 10 tables with 54 parameters describing different approaches and their consequences for understanding various mechanisms in ND changes. However, these methods also face challenges related to data accuracy and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this review proposes strategies that emphasize the need for rigorous validation and rapid integration into clinical practice. Such integration could transform ND diagnostics, making early detection tools more cost-effective and globally accessible. In conclusion, this review underscores the urgent need to incorporate validated digital health tools into mainstream medical practice. This integration could indicate a new era in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially altering the trajectory of these conditions for millions worldwide. Thus, by highlighting specific and statistically significant findings, this review demonstrates the current progress in this field and the potential impact of these advancements on the global management of NDs.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; digital endpoints; digital phenotyping; early detection; eye-tracking; machine learning; neurodegenerative diseases; online cognitive testing,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Biomarkers; Machine Learning,"Chudzik, A; Śledzianowski, A; Przybyszewski, AW"
Speech-Based Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Research.,"Digital biomarkers are of growing interest in the field of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research. Digital biomarker data arising from digital health tools holds various potential benefits: more objective and more accurate assessment of patients' symptoms and remote collection of signals in real-world scenarios but also multimodal variance for prediction models of individual disease progression. Speech can be collected at minimal patient burden and provides rich data for assessing multiple aspects of AD pathology including cognition. However, the operations around collecting, preparing, and validly interpreting speech data within the context of clinical research on AD remains complex and sometimes challenging. Through a dedicated pipeline of speech collection tools, preprocessing steps and algorithms, precise qualification and quantification of an AD patient's pathology can be achieved from their speech. The aim of this chapter is to describe the methods that are needed to create speech collection scenarios that result in valuable speech-based digital biomarkers for clinical research.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Cognition; Digital biomarkers; Speech biomarkers,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Speech; Biomarkers; Cognition; Disease Progression,"Schäfer, S; Herrmann, J; Tovar, S; Linz, N; Tröger, J"

Clonal CD8 T Cells Accumulate in the Leptomeninges and Communicate with Microglia in Human Neurodegeneration.,"Murine studies have highlighted a crucial role for immune cells in the meninges in surveilling the central nervous system (CNS) and influencing neuroinflammation. However, how meningeal immunity is altered in human neurodegeneration and its effects on CNS inflammation is understudied. We performed the first single-cell analysis of the transcriptomes and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of 104,635 immune cells from 55 postmortem human brain and leptomeningeal tissues from donors with neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. RNA and TCR sequencing from paired leptomeninges and brain allowed us to perform lineage tracing to identify the spatial trajectory of clonal T cells in the CNS and its borders. We propose that T cells activated in the brain emigrate to and establish residency in the leptomeninges where they likely contribute to impairments in lymphatic drainage and remotely to CNS inflammation by producing IFNγ and other cytokines. We identified regulatory networks local to the meninges including NK cell-mediated CD8 T cell killing which likely help to control meningeal inflammation. Collectively, these findings provide not only a foundation for future studies into brain border immune surveillance but also highlight important intercellular dynamics that could be leveraged to modulate neuroinflammation.",2024,,,"Hobson, R; Levy, SHS; Flaherty, D; Xiao, H; Ciener, B; Reddy, H; Singal, C; Kim, CY; Teich, AF; Shneider, NA; Bradshaw, EM; Elyaman, W"
Topographic metabolism-function relationships in Alzheimer's disease: A simultaneous PET/MRI study.,"Disruptions of neural metabolism and function occur in parallel during Alzheimer's disease (AD). While many studies have shown diverse metabolic-functional relationships in specific brain regions, much less is known about how large-scale network-level functional activity is associated with the topology of metabolism in AD. In this study, we took the advantages of simultaneous PET/MRI and multivariate analyses to investigate the associations between AD-related stereotypical spatial patterns (topographies) of glucose metabolism, measured by fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and functional connectivity, measured by resting-state functional MRI. A total of 101 participants, including 37 patients with AD, 25 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 39 cognitively normal controls, underwent PET/MRI scans and cognitive assessments. Three pairs of distinct but optimally correlated metabolic and functional topographies were identified, encompassing large-scale networks including the default-mode, executive and control, salience, attention, and subcortical networks. Importantly, the metabolic-functional associations were not only limited to one-to-one-corresponding regions, but also occur in remote and non-overlapping regions. Furthermore, both glucose metabolism and functional connectivity, as well as their linkages, exhibited various degrees of disruptions in patients with MCI and AD, and were correlated with cognitive decline. In conclusion, our results support distributed and heterogeneous topographic associations between metabolism and function, which are jeopardized by AD. Findings of this study may deepen our understanding of the pathological mechanism of AD through the perspectives of both local energy efficiency and long-term interactions between synaptic disruption and functional disconnection contributing to the clinical symptomatology in AD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; brain networks; functional connectivity; glucose metabolism; metabolic-functional association; simultaneous FDG-PET/fMRI,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Positron-Emission Tomography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Glucose,"Li, W; Zhang, M; Huang, R; Hu, J; Wang, L; Ye, G; Meng, H; Lin, X; Liu, J; Li, B; Zhang, Y; Li, Y"
Cognitive Vergence Recorded with a Webcam-Based Eye-Tracker during an Oddball Task in an Elderly Population.,"(1) Background: Our previous research provides evidence that vergence eye movements may significantly influence cognitive processing and could serve as a reliable measure of cognitive issues. The rise of consumer-grade eye tracking technology, which uses sophisticated imaging techniques in the visible light spectrum to determine gaze position, is noteworthy. In our study, we explored the feasibility of using webcam-based eye tracking to monitor the vergence eye movements of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) during a visual oddball paradigm. (2) Methods: We simultaneously recorded eye positions using a remote infrared-based pupil eye tracker. (3) Results: Both tracking methods effectively captured vergence eye movements and demonstrated robust cognitive vergence responses, where participants exhibited larger vergence eye movement amplitudes in response to targets versus distractors.

This method could lay the groundwork for future research aimed at creating an affordable screening tool for mental health care.",2024,Alzheimer; MCI; detection; eye tracking; iris; vergence eye movement,"Humans; Aged; Eye Movements; Vision, Binocular; Cognitive Dysfunction; Light; Cognition","Romeo, A; Leonovych, O; Solé Puig, M; Supèr, H"
Design of a pragmatic randomized implementation effectiveness trial testing a health system wide hypertension program for older adults.,"Hypertension control remains poor. Multiple barriers at the level of patients, providers, and health systems interfere with implementation of hypertension guidelines and effective lowering of BP. Some strategies such as self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) and remote management by pharmacists are safe and effectively lower BP but have not been effectively implemented. In this study, we combine such evidence-based strategies to build a remote hypertension program and test its effectiveness and implementation in large health systems. This randomized, controlled, pragmatic type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial will examine the virtual collaborative care clinic (vCCC), a hypertension program that integrates automated patient identification, SMBP, remote BP monitoring by trained health system pharmacists, and frequent patient-provider communication. We will randomize 1000 patients with uncontrolled hypertension from two large health systems in a 1:1 ratio to either vCCC or control (usual care with education) groups for a 2-year intervention. Outcome measures including BP measurements, cognitive function, and a symptom checklist will be completed during study visits. Other outcome measures of cardiovascular events, mortality, and health care utilization will be assessed using Medicare data. For the primary outcome of proportion achieving BP control (defined as systolic BP < 130 mmHg) in the two groups, we will use a generalized linear mixed model analysis. Implementation outcomes include acceptability and feasibility of the program.

Olfactory and cognitive decrements in 1991 Gulf War veterans with gulf war illness/chronic multisymptom illness.,"Gulf War illness (GWI)/Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI) is a disorder related to military service in the 1991 Gulf War (GW). Prominent symptoms of GWI/CMI include fatigue, pain, and cognitive dysfunction. Although anosmia is not a typical GWI/CMI symptom, anecdotally some GW veterans have reported losing their sense smell shortly after the war. Because olfactory deficit is a prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and because we previously reported suggestive evidence that deployed GW veterans may be at increased risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia, the current study examined the relationship between olfactory and cognitive function in deployed GW veterans.",2024,"Cognition; Cognitive; Gulf war; Olfaction, neurotoxicant; Veterans",Male; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Veterans; Parkinson Disease; Gulf War; Smell; Persian Gulf Syndrome; Cognition; Dementia,"Chao, LL"

"A framework for language technologies in behavioral research and clinical applications: Ethical challenges, implications, and solutions.","Technological advances in the assessment and understanding of speech and language within the domains of automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning present a remarkable opportunity for psychologists to learn more about human thought and communication, evaluate a variety of clinical conditions, and predict cognitive and psychological states. These innovations can be leveraged to automate traditionally time-intensive assessment tasks (e.g., educational assessment), provide psychological information and care (e.g., chatbots), and when delivered remotely (e.g., by mobile phone or wearable sensors) promise underserved communities greater access to health care. Indeed, the automatic analysis of speech provides a wealth of information that can be used for patient care in a wide range of settings (e.g., mHealth applications) and for diverse purposes (e.g., behavioral and clinical research, medical tools that are implemented into practice) and patient types (e.g., numerous psychological disorders and in psychiatry and neurology). However, automation of speech analysis is a complex task that requires the integration of several different technologies within a large distributed process with numerous stakeholders. Many organizations have raised awareness about the need for robust systems for ensuring transparency, oversight, and regulation of technologies utilizing artificial intelligence. Since there is limited knowledge about the ethical and legal implications of these applications in psychological science, we provide a balanced view of both the optimism that is widely published on and also the challenges and risks of use, including discrimination and exacerbation of structural inequalities.

Digital remote monitoring for screening and early detection of urinary tract infections.,"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are one of the most prevalent bacterial infections in older adults and a significant contributor to unplanned hospital admissions in People Living with Dementia (PLWD), with early detection being crucial due to the predicament of reporting symptoms and limited help-seeking behaviour. The most common diagnostic tool is urine sample analysis, which can be time-consuming and is only employed where UTI clinical suspicion exists. In this method development and proof-of-concept study, participants living with dementia were monitored via low-cost devices in the home that passively measure activity, sleep, and nocturnal physiology. Using 27828 person-days of remote monitoring data (from 117 participants), we engineered features representing symptoms used for diagnosing a UTI. We then evaluate explainable machine learning techniques in passively calculating UTI risk and perform stratification on scores to support clinical translation and allow control over the balance between alert rate and sensitivity and specificity. The proposed UTI algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 65.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 64.3-66.2) and specificity of 70.9% (68.6-73.1) when predicting UTIs on unseen participants and after risk stratification, a sensitivity of 74.7% (67.9-81.5) and specificity of 87.9% (85.0-90.9). In addition, feature importance methods reveal that the largest contributions to the predictions were bathroom visit statistics, night-time respiratory rate, and the number of previous UTI events, aligning with the literature. Our machine learning method alerts clinicians of UTI risk in subjects, enabling earlier detection and enhanced screening when considering treatment.",2024,,,"Capstick, A; Palermo, F; Zakka, K; Fletcher-Lloyd, N; Walsh, C; Cui, T; Kouchaki, S; Jackson, R; Tran, M; Crone, M; Jensen, K; Freemont, P; Vaidyanathan, R; Kolanko, M; True, J; Daniels, S; Wingfield, D; Nilforooshan, R; Barnaghi, P"

Advances in the study of the effects of gut microflora on microglia in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system (CNS) degenerative disorder, is caused by various factors including β-amyloid toxicity, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, oxidative stress, and others. The dysfunction of microglia has been associated with the onset and advancement of different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD. The gut of mammals harbors a vast and complex population of microorganisms, commonly referred to as the microbiota. There's a growing recognition that these gut microbes are intrinsically intertwined with mammalian physiology. Through the circulation of metabolites, they establish metabolic symbiosis, enhance immune function, and establish communication with different remote cells, including those in the brain. The gut microbiome plays a crucial part in influencing the development and performance of microglia, as indicated by recent preclinical studies. Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora leads to alterations in the microglia transcriptome that regulate the interconversion of microglia subtypes. This conversation explores recent research that clarifies how gut bacteria, their byproducts, and harmful elements affect the activation and characteristics of microglia. This understanding opens doors to innovative microbial-based therapeutic strategies for early identification and treatment goals in AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; brain-gut axis; gastrointestinal microbiome; microglia; neurogenic inflammation,,"Wu, JJ; Wei, Z"
Amyloid induced hyperexcitability in default mode network drives medial temporal hyperactivity and early tau accumulation.,"In early Alzheimer's disease (AD) β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits throughout association cortex and tau appears in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Why these initially appear in disparate locations is not understood. Using task-based fMRI and multimodal PET imaging, we assess the impact of local AD pathology on network-to-network interactions. We show that AD pathologies flip interactions between the default mode network (DMN) and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) from inhibitory to excitatory. The DMN is hyperexcited with increasing levels of Aβ, which drives hyperexcitability within the MTL and this directed hyperexcitation of the MTL by the DMN predicts the rate of tau accumulation within the EC. Our results support a model whereby Aβ induces disruptions to local excitatory-inhibitory balance in the DMN, driving hyperexcitability in the MTL, leading to tau accumulation. We propose that Aβ-induced disruptions to excitatory-inhibitory balance is a candidate causal route between Aβ and remote EC-tau accumulation.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; fMRI; functional connectivity; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease; tau,Humans; tau Proteins; Default Mode Network; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Entorhinal Cortex; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography,"Giorgio, J; Adams, JN; Maass, A; Jagust, WJ; Breakspear, M"

Digital phenotyping: An equal opportunity approach to reducing disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"A rapidly aging world population is fueling a concomitant increase in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD).

These cohorts are engaging with the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative (DAC), a global partnership that brings together cohorts from around the world to advance understanding of AD. Each cohort is poised to leverage the widespread use of mobile devices to integrate digital phenotyping into current methodologies and mitigate the lack of representativeness in AD research of racial and ethnic minorities across the globe. In addition to methods that these three cohorts are already using, DAC has developed a digital phenotyping protocol that can collect ADRD-related data remotely via smartphone and/or in clinic via a tablet to generate a common data elements digital dataset that can be harmonized with additional clinical and molecular data being collected at each cohort site and when combined across cohorts and made accessible can provide a global data resource that is more racially/ethnically represented of the world population.",2023,biomarkers; digital technologies; health disparity; minority and vulnerable populations,,"Britton, GB; Huang, LK; Villarreal, AE; Levey, A; Philippakis, A; Hu, CJ; Yang, CC; Mushi, D; Oviedo, DC; Rangel, G; Ho, JS; Thompson, L; Khemakhem, M; Ross, M; Carreira, MB; Kim, N; Joung, P; Albastaki, O; Kuo, PC; Low, S; Paddick, SM; Kuan, YC; Au, R"

Cholesterol 24-hydroxylase at the choroid plexus contributes to brain immune homeostasis.,"The choroid plexus (CP) plays a key role in remotely controlling brain function in health, aging, and disease. Here, we report that CP epithelial cells express the brain-specific cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) and that its levels are decreased under different mouse and human brain conditions, including amyloidosis, aging, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using primary mouse CP cell cultures, we demonstrate that the enzymatic product of CYP46A1, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, downregulates inflammatory transcriptomic signatures within the CP, found here to be elevated across multiple neurological conditions. In vitro, the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) downregulates CYP46A1 expression, while overexpression of CYP46A1 or its pharmacological activation in mouse CP organ cultures increases resilience to TNF-α. In vivo, overexpression of CYP46A1 in the CP in transgenic mice with amyloidosis is associated with better cognitive performance and decreased brain inflammation. Our findings suggest that CYP46A1 expression in the CP impacts the role of this niche as a guardian of brain immune homeostasis.",2023,24-OH; Alzheimer’s disease; COVID-19; CYP46A1; TNF-α; blood-CSF barrier; inflammation; neurodegeneration aging,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Cholesterol 24-Hydroxylase; Choroid Plexus; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Brain; Homeostasis; Mice, Transgenic; Amyloidosis","Tsitsou-Kampeli, A; Suzzi, S; Kenigsbuch, M; Satomi, A; Strobelt, R; Singer, O; Feldmesser, E; Purnapatre, M; Colaiuta, SP; David, E; Cahalon, L; Hahn, O; Wyss-Coray, T; Shaul, Y; Amit, I; Schwartz, M"

Polypathology is common, and the lines between these conditions post TBI can be somewhat blurred. The mechanisms through which TBI leads to future neurodegeneration are not well understood. Heterogeneity and distance from the injury or injuries and individual genetic and environmental factors make clinical studies difficult. We present the case of an 82-year-old man who died 4 years after developing a phenotypically mixed dementia with neuropsychiatric features and parkinsonism. He had a remote history of a severe TBI 40 years prior, following a road traffic accident which caused a large right frontal injury, requiring neurosurgical intervention. Post-mortem neuropathological examination demonstrated abnormal phosphorylated-Tau (p-Tau), beta-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and α-synuclein deposition. Spatial immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased perivascular accumulation of p-Tau with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption at the site of injury, which decreased with distance from the injury site. The appearances are suggestive of initial vascular disruption with persisting BBB disruption as a driver of the pathology.",2023,,"Male; Humans; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; tau Proteins; Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain","Brennan, D; Delaney, C; Farrell, M; Campbell, M; Doherty, CP"

"Spinal cord injury induced exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease like pathophysiology is reduced by topical application of nanowired cerebrolysin with monoclonal antibodies to amyloid beta peptide, p-tau and tumor necrosis factor alpha.","Hallmark of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid beta peptide and phosphorylated tau deposition in brain that could be aggravated following traumatic of concussive head injury. However, amyloid beta peptide or p-tau in spinal cord following injury is not well known. In this investigation we measured amyloid beta peptide and p-tau together with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in spinal cord and brain following 48 h after spinal cord injury in relation to the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barrier, edema formation, blood flow changes and cell injury in perifocal regions of the spinal cord and brain areas. A focal spinal cord injury was inflicted over the right dorsal horn of the T10-11 segment (4 mm long and 2 mm deep) and amyloid beta peptide and p-tau was measured in perifocal rostral (T9) and caudal (T12) spinal cord segments as well as in the brain areas. Our observations showed a significant increase in amyloid beta peptide in the T9 and T12 segments as well as in remote areas of brain and spinal cord after 24 and 48 h injury. This is associated with breakdown of the blood-spinal cord (BSCB) and brain barriers (BBB), edema formation, reduction in blood flow and cell injury. After 48 h of spinal cord injury elevation of amyloid beta peptide, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was seen in T9 and T12 segments of spinal cord in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and brain stem regions associated with microglial activation as seen by upregulation of Iba1 and CD86. Repeated nanowired delivery of cerebrolysin topically over the traumatized segment repeatedly together with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to amyloid beta peptide (AβP), p-tau and TNF-α significantly attenuated amyloid beta peptide, p-tau deposition and reduces Iba1, CD68 and TNF-α levels in the brain and spinal cord along with blockade of BBB and BSCB, reduction in blood flow, edema formation and cell injury. These observations are the first to show that spinal cord injury induces Alzheimer's disease like symptoms in the CNS, not reported earlier.",2023,Amyloid beta peptide; Blood–brain barrier; Blood–spinal cord barrier; CD86; Cerebrolysin; Iba1; Microglia; Monoclonal antibodies therapy; Nanowired delivery; Phosphorylated-tau; Serotonin; Spinal cord edema; Spinal cord injury; Tumor necrosis factor-alpha,"Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Edema; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Injuries; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Animals; Rats; Nanowires","Sharma, A; Feng, L; Muresanu, DF; Tian, ZR; Lafuente, JV; Buzoianu, AD; Nozari, A; Wiklund, L; Sharma, HS"
Abnormal network connections to early visual cortex in posterior cortical atrophy.,"Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a visual variant of Alzheimer's disease, initially manifests with higher-order visual disorders and parieto/temporo-occipital atrophy. Recent studies have shown remote functional impairment in both distant brain networks and along the calcarine sulcus (V1). Functional alteration in the calcarine differs along its length, reflecting center to periphery visual space differences. Herein, we aim to connect between these two sets of findings by looking at the retinotopic patterns of functional connectivity between large-scale brain networks and V1, comparing patients with normally sighted subjects.",2023,Connectivity; DMN; FPN; PCA; V1,Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain Mapping; Atrophy; Visual Cortex; Neural Pathways,"Bick, A; McKyton, A; Glick-Shames, H; Rein, N; Levin, N"
Synthesizing images of tau pathology from cross-modal neuroimaging using deep learning.,"Given the prevalence of dementia and the development of pathology-specific disease-modifying therapies, high-value biomarker strategies to inform medical decision-making are critical. In vivo tau-PET is an ideal target as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and treatment outcome measure. However, tau-PET is not currently widely accessible to patients compared to other neuroimaging methods. In this study, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that imputes tau-PET images from more widely available cross-modality imaging inputs. Participants (n = 1192) with brain T1-weighted MRI (T1w), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, amyloid-PET and tau-PET were included. We found that a CNN model can impute tau-PET images with high accuracy, the highest being for the FDG-based model followed by amyloid-PET and T1w. In testing implications of artificial intelligence-imputed tau-PET, only the FDG-based model showed a significant improvement of performance in classifying tau positivity and diagnostic groups compared to the original input data, suggesting that application of the model could enhance the utility of the metabolic images. The interpretability experiment revealed that the FDG- and T1w-based models utilized the non-local input from physically remote regions of interest to estimate the tau-PET, but this was not the case for the Pittsburgh compound B-based model. This implies that the model can learn the distinct biological relationship between FDG-PET, T1w and tau-PET from the relationship between amyloid-PET and tau-PET. Our study suggests that extending neuroimaging's use with artificial intelligence to predict protein specific pathologies has great potential to inform emerging care models.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; FDG PET; cross-modality imputation; deep learning; tau PET,Humans; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Artificial Intelligence; Biomarkers; Deep Learning; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Neuroimaging; Tauopathies,"Lee, J; Burkett, BJ; Min, HK; Senjem, ML; Dicks, E; Corriveau-Lecavalier, N; Mester, CT; Wiste, HJ; Lundt, ES; Murray, ME; Nguyen, AT; Reichard, RR; Botha, H; Graff-Radford, J; Barnard, LR; Gunter, JL; Schwarz, CG; Kantarci, K; Knopman, DS; Boeve, BF; Lowe, VJ; Petersen, RC; Jack, CR; Jones, DT"

The use of the integrated cognitive assessment to improve the efficiency of primary care referrals to memory services in the accelerating dementia pathway technologies study.,"Current primary care cognitive assessment tools are either crude or time-consuming instruments that can only detect cognitive impairment when it is well established. This leads to unnecessary or late referrals to memory services, by which time the disease may have already progressed into more severe stages. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some memory services have adapted to the new environment by shifting to remote assessments of patients to meet service user demand. However, the use of remote cognitive assessments has been inconsistent, and there has been little evaluation of the outcome of such a change in clinical practice. Emerging research has highlighted computerized cognitive tests, such as the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA), as the leading candidates for adoption in clinical practice.

Validating virtual administration of neuropsychological testing in Parkinson disease: a pilot study.,"COVID-19 has highlighted the need for remote cognitive testing, but the reliability and validity of virtual cognitive testing in Parkinson disease (PD) is unknown. Therefore, we assessed PD participants enrolled in an observational, cognition-focused study with an extensive cognitive battery completed both in-person and via video conference close in time. Data for 35 PD participants with normal cognition to mild dementia were analyzed. Only one test (semantic verbal fluency) demonstrated a difference in score by administration type, with a significantly better score virtually. Only three tests demonstrated good reliability for in-person versus virtual testing, but reliability values for visit 1 versus visit 2 were similarly low overall. Trail Making Test B was successfully administered virtually to only 18 participants due to technical issues. Virtual and in-person cognitive testing generate similar scores at the group level, but with poor to moderate reliability for most tests. Mode of test administration, learning effects, and technical difficulties explained little of the low test-retest reliability, indicating possible significant short-term variability in cognitive performance in PD in general, which has implications for clinical care and research. In-person cognitive testing with a neuropsychologist remains the gold standard, and it remains to be determined if virtual cognitive testing is feasible in PD.",2023,,Humans; Parkinson Disease; Cognition Disorders; Pilot Projects; Reproducibility of Results; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognitive Dysfunction,"Gallagher, J; Mamikonyan, E; Xie, SX; Tran, B; Shaw, S; Weintraub, D"
Remote evaluation of sleep to enhance understanding of early dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (RESTED-AD): an observational cohort study protocol.,"Sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are well recognised in both AD (Alzheimer's Disease) dementia and MCI-AD (Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease). Such abnormalities include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, decreased sleep efficiency, increased sleep fragmentation and sundowning. Enhancing understanding of sleep abnormalities may unveil targets for intervention in sleep, a promising approach given hypotheses that sleep disorders may exacerbate AD pathological progression and represent a contributory factor toward impaired cognitive performance and worse quality of life. This may also permit early diagnosis of AD pathology, widely acknowledged as a pre-requisite for future disease-modifying therapies. This study aims to bridge the divide between in-laboratory polysomnographic studies which allow for rich characterisation of sleep but in an unnatural setting, and naturalistic studies typically approximating sleep through use of non-EEG wearable devices. It is also designed to record sleep patterns over a 2 month duration sufficient to capture both infradian rhythm and compensatory responses following suboptimal sleep. Finally, it harnesses an extensively phenotyped population including with AD blood biomarkers. Its principal aims are to improve characterisation of sleep and biological rhythms in individuals with AD, particularly focusing on micro-architectural measures of sleep, compensatory responses to suboptimal sleep and the relationship between sleep parameters, biological rhythms and cognitive performance.",2023,AD; Alzheimer’s disease; Circadian; Dementia; EEG; Infradian; MCI; Mild cognitive impairment; Sleep,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Quality of Life; Sleep; Dementia; Cohort Studies; Observational Studies as Topic,"Blackman, J; Morrison, HD; Gabb, V; Biswas, B; Li, H; Turner, N; Jolly, A; Trender, W; Hampshire, A; Whone, A; Coulthard, E"
Virtual Assessment as a Way to Reduce Help-seeking Barriers in Older Adults With Subjective Cognitive Decline.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a potential early marker for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease, is common among older adults. Although it is often regarded as a personal health concern, most individuals with SCD do not seek help from a health care professional. Help-seeking (HS) is a complex, individualized process with significant life-course implications, and older adults often face several barriers to HS across personal, socioeconomic, and cultural domains. The pandemic exacerbated these barriers by imposing additional limitations on in-person care. In response, virtual assessment became a popular method to conduct remote care. We provide a narrative review of the challenges and triumphs that came with the transition from in-person, pen-paper cognitive assessments to virtual cognitive assessments. In addition, we address the impact virtual assessment had in tackling barriers that previously limited individuals with SCD from formal HS. We argue that virtual cognitive assessment helps alleviate health access barriers to HS (e.g., cost, transportation, and physician availability) and allows individuals with different coping styles to undergo assessment within more convenient environments. We hope the findings presented in this review inform health care practice, public education, and future research targeted towards the use of virtual assessment to facilitate HS in older adults with SCD.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease,"Kann, MR; Zeiger, PJ; Rizer, SJ; Cosentino, S; Azar, M"

Current emerging novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease and the future prospects of magneto-mechanical force therapy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly, and the morbidity increases with the aging population aggravation. The clinical symptoms of AD mainly include cognitive impairment and memory loss, which undoubtedly bring a huge burden to families and society. Currently, the drugs in clinical use only improve the symptoms of AD but do not cure or prevent the progression of the disease. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop novel therapeutic strategies for effective AD treatment. To provide a better theoretical basis for exploring novel therapeutic strategies in future AD treatment, this review introduces the recent AD treatment technologies from three aspects, including nanoparticle (NP) based drug therapy, biological therapy and physical therapy. The nanoparticle-mediated therapeutic approaches at the nanomaterial-neural interface and biological system are described in detail, and in particular the magneto-regulated strategies by magnetic field actuating magnetic nanoparticles are highlighted. Promising application of magneto-mechanical force regulated strategy in future AD treatment is also addressed, which offer possibilities for the remote manipulation in a precise manner. In the future, it may be possible for physicians to realize a remote, precise and effective therapy for AD using magneto-mechanical force regulated technology based on the combination of magnetic nanoparticles and an external magnetic field.",2023,,Humans; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Shen, Y; Wang, M; Li, S; Yang, J"
Evidence of Impaired Remote Experience-near Semantic Memory in Medial Temporal Lobe Amnesia.,"Neuropsychological research suggests that ""experience-near"" semantic memory, meaning knowledge attached to a spatiotemporal or event context, is commonly impaired in individuals who have medial temporal lobe amnesia. It is not known if this impairment extends to remotely acquired experience-near knowledge, which is a question relevant to understanding hippocampal/medial temporal lobe functioning. In the present study, we administered a novel semantic memory task designed to target knowledge associated with remote, ""dormant"" concepts, in addition to knowledge associated with active concepts, to four individuals with medial temporal lobe amnesia and eight matched controls. We found that the individuals with medial temporal lobe amnesia generated significantly fewer experience-near semantic memories for both remote concepts and active concepts. In comparison, the generation of abstract or ""experience-far"" knowledge was largely spared in the individuals with medial temporal lobe amnesia, regardless of whether the targets for retrieval were remote or active concepts. We interpret these findings as evidence that the medial temporal lobes may have a sustained role in the retrieval of semantic memories associated with spatiotemporal and event contexts, which are cognitive features often ascribed to episodic memory. These results align with recent theoretical models proposing that the hippocampus/medial temporal lobes support cognitive processes that are involved in, but not exclusive to, episodic memory.",2023,,"Humans; Semantics; Amnesia; Temporal Lobe; Memory Disorders; Hippocampus; Memory, Episodic; Neuropsychological Tests","Grilli, MD; Sabharwal-Siddiqi, S; Thayer, SC; Rapcsak, SZ; Ekstrom, AD"

TIHM: An open dataset for remote healthcare monitoring in dementia.,"Dementia is a progressive condition that affects cognitive and functional abilities. There is a need for reliable and continuous health monitoring of People Living with Dementia (PLWD) to improve their quality of life and support their independent living.

Managing these conditions continuously can inform better decision-making earlier for higher-quality care management for PLWD. The Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) project developed a new digital platform to routinely collect longitudinal, observational, and measurement data, within the home and apply machine learning and analytical models for the detection and prediction of adverse health events affecting the well-being of PLWD. This work describes the TIHM dataset collected during the second phase (i.e., feasibility study) of the TIHM project.

Online gallery facilitated art activities for people with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: A narrative review.,"Art activities for people with dementia have a range of therapeutic benefits including psychosocial wellbeing and enhanced quality of life. Successful art programs promote social engagement, are inclusive and empowering, and enable opportunity for people with dementia to express themselves verbally and non-verbally. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing precautions have impacted the capacity of art galleries and museums to deliver in-person programs. However, they have also provided a new opportunity. This paper explores the potential benefits, challenges, and future directions for research relating to the online delivery of gallery-facilitated art activities for people with dementia. The evidence revealed that increased digitisation of programs increased access for participants, however, the majority of the research was published before the pandemic. Nevertheless, COVID-19 has necessitated many museums and galleries to engage with people with dementia online.

Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Cloud-Based Deep Learning Paradigm.,"Deep learning is playing a major role in identifying complicated structure, and it outperforms in term of training and classification tasks in comparison to traditional algorithms. In this work, a local cloud-based solution is developed for classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as MRI scans as input modality. The multi-classification is used for AD variety and is classified into four stages. In order to leverage the capabilities of the pre-trained GoogLeNet model, transfer learning is employed. The GoogLeNet model, which is pre-trained for image classification tasks, is fine-tuned for the specific purpose of multi-class AD classification. Through this process, a better accuracy of 98% is achieved. As a result, a local cloud web application for Alzheimer's prediction is developed using the proposed architectures of GoogLeNet.

European Projects for Patients with Dementia and Their Caregivers.,"As we all know there is no treatment that can stop or delay the progression of dementia. The treatment we use is only symptomatic. EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) recommendations for dementia prevention by Sorbi et al. (2012) concluded that there is no treatment, no lifestyle, which could have an effect on prevention or delay of onset of different forms of dementia until today. The future studies in prevention must recruit younger people, larger sample, and for longer period. The last 10 years we have run, in collaboration with organizations in different European countries, many projects in order to support patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly patients with dementia and their caregivers. The first project was a 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe: predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS (Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe) study, an FP5 project with 1380 patients. Five studies were published. The second project was DESCRIPA study, an FP5 project to DEvelopment of Screening guidelines and clinical CRIteria for Predementia Alzheimer's disease, with 881 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). LLM (Long Lasting Memories) and VRADA (A virtual reality application for the exercise of dementia and Alzheimer patients) are two projects that include body and cognitive exercise for health for the elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment. The next is the RECAGE (REspectful Caring for the AGitated Elderly) project (Horizon 2020), a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. With six European universities we finished a very interesting FP6 project, the AddNeuroMed one, which gives even now information about the progression of normal elderly MCI and AD patients, in collaboration with other consortia. A very interesting Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project about digital biomarkers was entitled Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR project). The main goal of this project was the development and validation of technology-enabled, quantitative and sensitive measures of functional decline in people with early-stage AD. A running project is an Erasmus+ one in the higher education field, ""Genetic counseling in European universities: The case of neurodegenerative diseases"" (GECONEU project). The target of this study is to develop an online course for university students focusing on genetic counseling, and support people and society to better understand the aims of genetic testing and the usefulness of genetic counseling by involving students in an innovative learning and teaching setting.

Challenges in Using mHealth Data From Smartphones and Wearable Devices to Predict Depression Symptom Severity: Retrospective Analysis.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects millions of people worldwide, but timely treatment is not often received owing in part to inaccurate subjective recall and variability in the symptom course. Objective and frequent MDD monitoring can improve subjective recall and help to guide treatment selection. Attempts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to explore the relationship between the measures of depression and passive digital phenotypes (features) extracted from smartphones and wearables devices to remotely and continuously monitor changes in symptomatology. However, a number of challenges exist for the analysis of these data. These include maintaining participant engagement over extended time periods and therefore understanding what constitutes an acceptable threshold of missing data; distinguishing between the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships for different features to determine their utility in tracking within-individual longitudinal variation or screening individuals at high risk; and understanding the heterogeneity with which depression manifests itself in behavioral patterns quantified by the passive features.",2023,behavioral patterns; depression; digital phenotypes; missing data; mobile health; mobile phone; smartphones; wearable devices,"Humans; Smartphone; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Retrospective Studies; Telemedicine; Wearable Electronic Devices","Sun, S; Folarin, AA; Zhang, Y; Cummins, N; Garcia-Dias, R; Stewart, C; Ranjan, Y; Rashid, Z; Conde, P; Laiou, P; Sankesara, H; Matcham, F; Leightley, D; White, KM; Oetzmann, C; Ivan, A; Lamers, F; Siddi, S; Simblett, S; Nica, R; Rintala, A; Mohr, DC; Myin-Germeys, I; Wykes, T; Haro, JM; Penninx, BWJH; Vairavan, S; Narayan, VA; Annas, P; Hotopf, M; Dobson, RJB"
Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Stroke.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) complications are seen in over 50% of ischemic stroke survivors; the most common complications are dysphagia, constipation, and GI bleeding. The bidirectional relationship of the gut-brain axis and stroke has recently gained traction, wherein stroke contributes to gut dysbiosis (alterations in the normal host intestinal microbiome) and gut dysbiosis perpetuates poor functional neurologic outcomes in stroke. It is postulated that the propagation of proinflammatory cells and gut metabolites (including trimethylamine N-oxide and short-chain fatty acids) from the GI tract to the central nervous system play a central role in gut-brain axis dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the known GI complications in acute ischemic stroke, our current knowledge from experimental stroke models for gut-brain axis dysfunction in stroke, and emerging therapeutics that target the gut-brain axis.",2023,,Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Dysbiosis; Stroke; Central Nervous System; Gastrointestinal Diseases,"Yong, HYF; Ganesh, A; Camara-Lemarroy, C"

An Educational Program for Remote Training and Supervision of Home-Based Transcranial Electrical Stimulation: Feasibility and Preliminary Effectiveness.,"There has been recent interest in the administration of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) by a caregiver, family member, or patient themselves while in their own homes (HB-tES). The need to properly train individuals in the administration of HB-tES is essential, and the lack of a uniform training approach across studies has come to light. The primary aim of this paper is to present the HB-tES training and supervision program, a tele-supervised, instructional, and evaluation program to teach laypersons how to administer HB-tES to a participant and to provide a standardized framework for remote monitoring of participants by teaching staff. The secondary aim is to present early pilot data on the feasibility and effectiveness of the training portion of the program based on its implementation in 379 sessions between two pilot clinical trials.",2024,Home-based; noninvasive brain stimulation; remote training; telehealth; telesupervision; transcranial alternating stimulation; transcranial direct current stimulation; transcranial electrical stimulation,Humans; Feasibility Studies; Male; Female; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Adult; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Patient Education as Topic; Home Care Services; Aged,"Cappon, D; den Boer, T; Yu, W; LaGanke, N; Fox, R; Brozgol, M; Hausdorff, JM; Manor, B; Pascual-Leone, A"
Eye-tracking paradigms for the assessment of mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), representing the 'transitional zone' between normal cognition and dementia, has become a novel topic in clinical research. Although early detection is crucial, it remains logistically challenging at the same time. While traditional pen-and-paper tests require in-depth training to ensure standardized administration and accurate interpretation of findings, significant technological advancements are leading to the development of procedures for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and facilitating the diagnostic process. Some of the diagnostic protocols, however, show significant limitations that hamper their widespread adoption. Concerns about the social and economic implications of the increasing incidence of AD underline the need for reliable, non-invasive, cost-effective, and timely cognitive scoring methodologies. For instance, modern clinical studies report significant oculomotor impairments among patients with MCI, who perform poorly in visual paired-comparison tasks by ascribing less attentional resources to novel stimuli. To accelerate the Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017-2025, this work provides an overview of research on saccadic and exploratory eye-movement deficits among older adults with MCI. The review protocol was drafted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2022 that examined visual processing in older adults with MCI and reported gaze parameters as potential biomarkers. Moreover, following the contemporary trend for remote healthcare technologies, we reviewed studies that implemented non-commercial eye-tracking instrumentation in order to detect information processing impairments among the MCI population. Based on the gathered literature, eye-tracking-based paradigms may ameliorate the screening limitations of traditional cognitive assessments and contribute to early AD detection. However, in order to translate the findings pertaining to abnormal gaze behavior into clinical applications, it is imperative to conduct longitudinal investigations in both laboratory-based and ecologically valid settings.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; cognitive assessment; dementia; eye-tracking; information processing; mild cognitive impairment; screening,,"Wolf, A; Tripanpitak, K; Umeda, S; Otake-Matsuura, M"
Capturing Measures That Matter: The Potential Value of Digital Measures of Physical Behavior for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of dementia worldwide. Despite the magnitude of AD's impact on patients, caregivers, and society, nearly all AD clinical trials fail. A potential contributor to this high rate of failure is that established clinical outcome assessments fail to capture subtle clinical changes, entail high burden for patients and their caregivers, and ineffectively address the aspects of health deemed important by patients and their caregivers. AD progression is associated with widespread changes in physical behavior that have impacts on the ability to function independently, which is a meaningful aspect of health for patients with AD and important for diagnosis. However, established assessments of functional independence remain underutilized in AD clinical trials and are limited by subjective biases and ceiling effects. Digital measures of real-world physical behavior assessed passively, continuously, and remotely using digital health technologies have the potential to address some of these limitations and to capture aspects of functional independence in patients with AD. In particular, measures of real-world gait, physical activity, and life-space mobility captured with wearable sensors may offer value. Additional research is needed to understand the validity, feasibility, and acceptability of these measures in AD clinical research.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; digital measure; drug development; gait; life-space mobility; meaningful aspect of health; physical behavior; physical function; wearable sensor,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Caregivers; Drug Development,"Bachman, SL; Blankenship, JM; Busa, M; Serviente, C; Lyden, K; Clay, I"

A FinnGen pilot clinical recall study for Alzheimer's disease.,"Successful development of novel therapies requires that clinical trials are conducted in patient cohorts with the highest benefit-to-risk ratio. Population-based biobanks with comprehensive health and genetic data from large numbers of individuals hold promise to facilitate identification of trial participants, particularly when interventions need to start while symptoms are still mild, such as for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study describes a process for clinical recall studies from FinnGen. We demonstrate the feasibility to systematically ascertain customized clinical data from FinnGen participants with ICD10 diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive disorder (MCD) in a single-center cross-sectional study testing blood-based biomarkers and cognitive functioning in-person, computer-based and remote. As a result, 19% (27/140) of a pre-specified FinnGen subcohort were successfully recalled and completed the study. Hospital records largely validated registry entries. For 8/12 MCD patients, other reasons than AD were identified as underlying diagnosis. Cognitive measures correlated across platforms, with highest consistencies for dementia screening (r = 0.818) and semantic fluency (r = 0.764), respectively, for in-person versus telephone-administered tests. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (p < 0.002) and phosphorylated-tau 181 (pTau-181) (p < 0.020) most reliably differentiated AD from MCD participants.

"25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and risk of incident dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and delirium in 443,427 UK Biobank participants.","This study aimed to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and delirium. Participants from the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank with complete information on serum 25(OH)D concentrations were enrolled. Dementia, MCI and delirium were defined using the UK Biobank algorithm. 443,427 participants with a mean (standard deviation) age of 56.8 (8.0) years were included in this study. Based on Cox regression models, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with the risk of dementia, MCI, and delirium in a dose-dependent manner after adjusting for demographics (P-trend <0.001). In comparison with 25(OH)D levels less than 32.4 nmol/L, participants with the highest 25(OH)D levels (i.e., >64.4 nmol/L) had the lowest risk of dementia (hazards ratio [HR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.69, P<0.001), MCI (HR: 0.55, 95% CI 0.37-0.84, P=0.005), and delirium (HR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.79, P<0.001). These results were consistent with the sensitivity analysis, in which participants with events occurring within the first two years of follow-up were excluded. This study found that a lower serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of dementia (including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia), MCI, and delirium.",2023,25-hydroxyvitamin D; Cognitive decline; Delirium; Dementia; Mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Middle Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Delirium,"Ma, JH; Huang, NH; Huang, T; Mu, DL"
Neuromuscular disease genetics in under-represented populations: increasing data diversity.,"Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) affect ∼15 million people globally. In high income settings DNA-based diagnosis has transformed care pathways and led to gene-specific therapies. However, most affected families are in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) with limited access to DNA-based diagnosis. Most (86%) published genetic data is derived from European ancestry. This marked genetic data inequality hampers understanding of genetic diversity and hinders accurate genetic diagnosis in all income settings. We developed a cloud-based transcontinental partnership to build diverse, deeply-phenotyped and genetically characterized cohorts to improve genetic architecture knowledge, and potentially advance diagnosis and clinical management. We connected 18 centres in Brazil, India, South Africa, Turkey, Zambia, Netherlands and the UK. We co-developed a cloud-based data solution and trained 17 international neurology fellows in clinical genomic data interpretation. Single gene and whole exome data were analysed via a bespoke bioinformatics pipeline and reviewed alongside clinical and phenotypic data in global webinars to inform genetic outcome decisions. We recruited 6001 participants in the first 43 months. Initial genetic analyses 'solved' or 'possibly solved' ∼56% probands overall. In-depth genetic data review of the four commonest clinical categories (limb girdle muscular dystrophy, inherited peripheral neuropathies, congenital myopathy/muscular dystrophies and Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy) delivered a ∼59% 'solved' and ∼13% 'possibly solved' outcome. Almost 29% of disease causing variants were novel, increasing diverse pathogenic variant knowledge. Unsolved participants represent a new discovery cohort. The dataset provides a large resource from under-represented populations for genetic and translational research. In conclusion, we established a remote transcontinental partnership to assess genetic architecture of NMDs across diverse populations. It supported DNA-based diagnosis, potentially enabling genetic counselling, care pathways and eligibility for gene-specific trials. Similar virtual partnerships could be adopted by other areas of global genomic neurological practice to reduce genetic data inequality and benefit patients globally.",2023,capacity building; equality and diversity; genomic medicine; inherited neuromuscular disease; low-to-middle income country,"Humans; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Neuromuscular Diseases; Muscular Dystrophies; Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle; DNA","Wilson, LA; Macken, WL; Perry, LD; Record, CJ; Schon, KR; Frezatti, RSS; Raga, S; Naidu, K; Köken, ÖY; Polat, I; Kapapa, MM; Dominik, N; Efthymiou, S; Morsy, H; Nel, M; Fassad, MR; Gao, F; Patel, K; Schoonen, M; Bisschoff, M; Vorster, A; Jonvik, H; Human, R; Lubbe, E; Nonyane, M; Vengalil, S; Nashi, S; Srivastava, K; Lemmers, RJLF; Reyaz, A; Mishra, R; Töpf, A; Trainor, CI; Steyn, EC; Mahungu, AC; van der Vliet, PJ; Ceylan, AC; Hiz, AS; Çavdarlı, B; Semerci Gündüz, CN; Ceylan, GG; Nagappa, M; Tallapaka, KB; Govindaraj, P; van der Maarel, SM; Narayanappa, G; Nandeesh, BN; Wa Somwe, S; Bearden, DR; Kvalsund, MP; Ramdharry, GM; Oktay, Y; Yiş, U; Topaloğlu, H; Sarkozy, A; Bugiardini, E; Henning, F; Wilmshurst, JM; Heckmann, JM; McFarland, R; Taylor, RW; Smuts, I; van der Westhuizen, FH; Sobreira, CFDR; Tomaselli, PJ; Marques, W; Bhatia, R; Dalal, A; Srivastava, MVP; Yareeda, S; Nalini, A; Vishnu, VY; Thangaraj, K; Straub, V; Horvath, R; Chinnery, PF; Pitceathly, RDS; Muntoni, F; Houlden, H; Vandrovcova, J; Reilly, MM; Hanna, MG"

Research on stress curve clustering algorithm of Fiber Bragg grating sensor.,"The global stress distribution and state parameter analysis of the building's main structure is an urgent problem to be solved in the online state assessment technology of building structure health. In this paper, a stress curve clustering algorithm of fiber Bragg grating stress sensor based on density clustering algorithm is proposed. To solve the problem of large dimension and sparse sample space of sensor stress curve, the distance between samples is measured based on improved cosine similarity. Aiming at the problem of low efficiency and poor effect of traditional clustering algorithm, density clustering algorithm based on mutual nearest neighbor is used to cluster. Finally, the classification of the daily stress load characteristics of the sensor is realized, which provides a basis for constructing the mathematical analysis model of building health. The experimental results show that the stress curve clustering method proposed in this paper is better than the latest clustering algorithms such as HDBSCAN, CBKM, K-mean++,FINCH and NPIR, and is suitable for the feature classification of stress curves of fiber Bragg grating sensors.",2023,,,"Lin, Y; Wang, Y; Qu, H; Xiong, Y"

Automatic Assessment of the 2-Minute Walk Distance for Remote Monitoring of People with Multiple Sclerosis.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of automatically assessing the 2-Minute Walk Distance (2MWD) for monitoring people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). For 154 pwMS, MS-related clinical outcomes as well as the 2MWDs as evaluated by clinicians and derived from accelerometer data were collected from a total of 323 periodic clinical visits. Accelerometer data from a wearable device during 100 home-based 2MWD assessments were also acquired. The error in estimating the 2MWD was validated for walk tests performed at hospital, and then the correlation (r) between clinical outcomes and home-based 2MWD assessments was evaluated. Robust performance in estimating the 2MWD from the wearable device was obtained, yielding an error of less than 10% in about two-thirds of clinical visits. Correlation analysis showed that there is a strong association between the actual and the estimated 2MWD obtained either at hospital (r = 0.71) or at home (r = 0.58). Furthermore, the estimated 2MWD exhibits moderate-to-strong correlation with various MS-related clinical outcomes, including disability and fatigue severity scores. Automatic assessment of the 2MWD in pwMS is feasible with the usage of a consumer-friendly wearable device in clinical and non-clinical settings.

A review of different types of volunteer programs for older adults with and without cognitive impairment.,"Theoretical models and empirical evidence suggest an association between volunteering and health outcomes in older adults. However, less is known about existing programs that involve older adults engaging in formal volunteering, especially programs for older volunteers with cognitive impairment. In this review, we summarized and evaluated different types of volunteering-based programs involving older volunteers with and without cognitive impairment. After a non-systematic literature search, we presented eight example volunteer programs. Older volunteers participate in the programs in person or remotely. In five of the programs, older volunteers without cognitive impairment participate in intergenerational engagement, support and referral, home visiting, and dementia care services. The other three programs specifically recruit older volunteers with cognitive impairment and provide intergenerational engagement and individualized volunteer activities. Both strengths and challenges identified in the programs were discussed. Different types of volunteering-based programs are available for engaging older volunteers. For volunteers to remain active during the pandemic or for volunteers who live with cognitive impairment, remote programs can be a valuable alternative.

"The pursuit of approaches to federate data to accelerate Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research: GAAIN, DPUK, and ADDI.","There is common consensus that data sharing accelerates science. Data sharing enhances the utility of data and promotes the creation and competition of scientific ideas. Within the Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) community, data types and modalities are spread across many organizations, geographies, and governance structures. The ADRD community is not alone in facing these challenges, however, the problem is even more difficult because of the need to share complex biomarker data from centers around the world. Heavy-handed data sharing mandates have, to date, been met with limited success and often outright resistance. Interest in making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) has often resulted in centralized platforms. However, when data governance and sovereignty structures do not allow the movement of data, other methods, such as federation, must be pursued. Implementation of fully federated data approaches are not without their challenges. The user experience may become more complicated, and federated analysis of unstructured data types remains challenging. Advancement in federated data sharing should be accompanied by improvement in federated learning methodologies so that federated data sharing becomes functionally equivalent to direct access to record level data. In this article, we discuss federated data sharing approaches implemented by three data platforms in the ADRD field: Dementia's Platform UK (DPUK) in 2014, the Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) in 2012, and the Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative (ADDI) in 2020.

Digital tools for delivery of dementia education for caregivers of persons with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of impact on caregiver distress and depressive symptoms.,"Continuing education for dementia has been shown to be beneficial by improving informal caregiver knowledge, dementia care, management, and caregiver physical and mental health. Technology-based dementia education has been noted to have equivalent effects as in-person education, but with the added benefit of asynchronous and/or remote delivery, which increases accessibility. Using Cochrane review methodology, this study systematically reviewed the literature on technology-based dementia education and its impacts on caregivers. Technology-based delivery included dementia education delivered via the Internet, telephone, telehealth, videophone, computer, or digital video device (DVD). In the review, twenty-eight studies were identified with fourteen included in a meta-analysis, and these data revealed a significant small effect of technologically based dementia education on reducing caregiver depression, and a medium effect on reducing caregiver distress in response to caregivers' observations of behavioral problems displayed by persons with dementia. No evidence was found for a significant effect of the educational intervention on caregiver burden or self-efficacy, which are known to be gendered aspects of caregiving. None of the studies included in the meta-analysis reported separate outcomes for male and female care providers, which has implications for gendered caregiving norms and aspects of care.

Clinical Evaluation in Parkinson's Disease: Is the Golden Standard Shiny Enough?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) has become the second most common neurodegenerative condition following Alzheimer's disease (AD), exhibiting high prevalence and incident rates. Current care strategies for PD patients include brief appointments, which are sparsely allocated, at outpatient clinics, where, in the best case scenario, expert neurologists evaluate disease progression using established rating scales and patient-reported questionnaires, which have interpretability issues and are subject to recall bias. In this context, artificial-intelligence-driven telehealth solutions, such as wearable devices, have the potential to improve patient care and support physicians to manage PD more effectively by monitoring patients in their familiar environment in an objective manner. In this study, we evaluate the validity of in-office clinical assessment using the MDS-UPDRS rating scale compared to home monitoring. Elaborating the results for 20 patients with Parkinson's disease, we observed moderate to strong correlations for most symptoms (bradykinesia, rest tremor, gait impairment, and freezing of gait), as well as for fluctuating conditions (dyskinesia and OFF). In addition, we identified for the first time the existence of an index capable of remotely measuring patients' quality of life. In summary, an in-office examination is only partially representative of most PD symptoms and cannot accurately capture daytime fluctuations and patients' quality of life.",2023,UPDRS; fluctuations; motor symptoms; quality of life; wearable device,"Humans; Parkinson Disease; Quality of Life; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Tremor; Dyskinesias","Kanellos, FS; Tsamis, KI; Rigas, G; Simos, YV; Katsenos, AP; Kartsakalis, G; Fotiadis, DI; Vezyraki, P; Peschos, D; Konitsiotis, S"

"Unsupervised, frequent and remote: A novel platform for personalised digital phenotyping of long-term memory in humans.","Long-term memory tests are commonly used to facilitate the diagnosis of hippocampal-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease due to their relatively high specificity and sensitivity to damage to the medial temporal lobes compared to standard commonly used clinical tests. Pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease start years before the formal diagnosis is made, partially due to testing too late. This proof-of-concept exploratory study aimed to assess the feasibility of introducing an unsupervised digital platform for continuous testing of long-term memory over long periods outside the laboratory environment. To address this challenge, we developed a novel digital platform, hAge ('healthy Age'), which integrates double spatial alternation, image recognition and visuospatial tasks for frequent remote unsupervised assessment of spatial and non-spatial long-term memory carried out continuously over eight week period. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we tested whether we could achieve sufficient levels of adherence and whether the performance on hAge tasks is comparable to the performance observed in the analogous standard tests measured in the controlled laboratory environments.191 healthy adults (67% females, 18-81 years old) participated in the study. We report an estimated 42.4% adherence level with minimal inclusion criteria. In line with findings using standard laboratory tests, we showed that performance on the spatial alternation task negatively correlated with inter-trial periods and the performance levels on image recognition and visuospatial tasks could be controlled by varying image similarity. Importantly, we demonstrated that frequent engagement with the double spatial alternation task leads to a strong practice effect, previously identified as a potential measure of cognitive decline in MCI patients. Finally, we discuss how lifestyle and motivation confounds may present a serious challenge for cognitive assessment in real-world uncontrolled environments.",2023,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Memory, Long-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; Recognition, Psychology; Proof of Concept Study","Bauza, M; Krstulovic, M; Krupic, J"

Exploring mechanisms that affect retrograde memory for public events in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: A longitudinal update.,"Here, we examined mechanisms that affect retrograde memory in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) as a function of longitudinal clinical outcome. 8 a-MCI who converted to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) during the subsequent 3-year follow-up (converter a-MCI) and 10 a-MCI who remained clinically stable during the same period (stable a-MCI) were compared at the baseline evaluation (i.e., when they were diagnosed as a-MCI) using a remote memory questionnaire for public events that allows disentangling the differential contribution of storage and retrieval mechanisms to performance accuracy. Results suggest that deficits in remote memory are primarily explained by impaired retrieval abilities in stable a-MCI and by impaired storage in converter-to-AD a-MCI. This distinction between retrograde amnesia due to defective trace utilisation in stable a-MCI and trace storage in converter a-MCI is consistent with the temporal unfolding of declining anterograde memory over the course of disease progression to AD.",2023,Alzheimer disease; memory impairment; mild cognitive impairment; public events; retrograde amnesia,Humans; Cognitive Dysfunction; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression; Neuropsychological Tests,"De Simone, MS; Rodini, M; De Tollis, M; Caltagirone, C; Carlesimo, GA"

A scoping review of neurodegenerative manifestations in explainable digital phenotyping.,"Neurologists nowadays no longer view neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, as single entities, but rather as a spectrum of multifaceted symptoms with heterogeneous progression courses and treatment responses. The definition of the naturalistic behavioral repertoire of early neurodegenerative manifestations is still elusive, impeding early diagnosis and intervention. Central to this view is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in reinforcing the depth of phenotypic information, thereby supporting the paradigm shift to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. This suggestion advocates the definition of disease subtypes in a new biomarker-supported nosology framework, yet without empirical consensus on standardization, reliability and interpretability. Although the well-defined neurodegenerative processes, linked to a triad of motor and non-motor preclinical symptoms, are detected by clinical intuition, we undertake an unbiased data-driven approach to identify different patterns of neuropathology distribution based on the naturalistic behavior data inherent to populations in-the-wild. We appraise the role of remote technologies in the definition of digital phenotyping specific to brain-, body- and social-level neurodegenerative subtle symptoms, emphasizing inter- and intra-patient variability powered by deep learning. As such, the present review endeavors to exploit digital technologies and AI to create disease-specific phenotypic explanations, facilitating the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases as ""bio-psycho-social"" conditions. Not only does this translational effort within explainable digital phenotyping foster the understanding of disease-induced traits, but it also enhances diagnostic and, eventually, treatment personalization.",2023,,,"Alfalahi, H; Dias, SB; Khandoker, AH; Chaudhuri, KR; Hadjileontiadis, LJ"

The roles of fungus in CNS autoimmune and neurodegeneration disorders.,"Fungal infection or proliferation in our body is capable of initiation of strong inflammation and immune responses that result in different consequences, including infection-trigged organ injury and inflammation-related remote organ dysfunction. Fungi associated infectious diseases have been well recognized in the clinic. However, whether fungi play an important role in non-infectious central nervous system disease is still to be elucidated. Recently, a growing amount of evidence point to a non-negligible role of peripheral fungus in triggering unique inflammation, immune response, and exacerbation of a range of non-infectious CNS disorders, including Multiple sclerosis, Neuromyelitis optica, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis et al. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in recognizing patterns and inflammatory signaling of fungi in different subsets of immune cells, with a specific focus on its function in CNS autoimmune and neurodegeneration diseases. In conclusion, the fungus is capable of triggering unique inflammation by multiple mechanisms in the progression of a body of CNS non-infectious diseases, suggesting it serves as a key factor and critical novel target for the development of potential therapeutic strategies.",2022,brain disorders; disease; fungus; multiple sclerosis; signaling,Central Nervous System; Central Nervous System Diseases; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Fungi; Inflammation,"Wu, C; Jiang, ML; Jiang, R; Pang, T; Zhang, CJ"

The promise of portable remote auditory stimulation tools to enhance slow-wave sleep and prevent cognitive decline.,"Dementia is the seventh leading cause of mortality, and a major source of disability and dependency in older individuals globally. Cognitive decline (and, to a lesser extent, normal ageing) are associated with sleep fragmentation and loss of slow-wave sleep. Evidence suggests a bidirectional causal link between these losses. Phase-locked auditory stimulation has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool to enhance slow-wave sleep, potentially ameliorating cognitive decline. In laboratory settings, auditory stimulation is usually supervised by trained experts. Different algorithms (simple amplitude thresholds, topographic correlation, sine-wave fitting, phase-locked loop, and phase vocoder) are used to precisely target auditory stimulation to a desired phase of the slow wave. While all algorithms work well in younger adults, the altered sleep physiology of older adults and particularly those with neurodegenerative disorders requires a tailored approach that can adapt to older adults' fragmented sleep and reduced amplitudes of slow waves. Moreover, older adults might require a continuous intervention that is not feasible in laboratory settings. Recently, several auditory stimulation-capable portable devices ('Dreem®', 'SmartSleep®' and 'SleepLoop®') have been developed. We discuss these three devices regarding their potential as tools for science, and as clinical remote-intervention tools to combat cognitive decline. Currently, SleepLoop® shows the most promise for scientific research in older adults due to high transparency and customizability but is not commercially available. Studies evaluating down-stream effects on cognitive abilities, especially in patient populations, are required before a portable auditory stimulation device can be recommended as a clinical preventative remote-intervention tool.",2023,Alzheimer's disease; closed-loop; home-use devices; memory; slow-wave sleep (SWS); treatment,"Humans; Aged; Sleep, Slow-Wave; Acoustic Stimulation; Electroencephalography; Sleep; Cognitive Dysfunction","Zeller, CJ; Züst, MA; Wunderlin, M; Nissen, C; Klöppel, S"

Pre-frail older adults show improved cognition with StayFitLonger computerized home-based training: a randomized controlled trial.,"Multidomain interventions have shown tremendous potential for improving cognition in older adults. It is unclear if multidomain interventions can be delivered remotely and whether remote intervention is beneficial for older adults who are vulnerable or at risk of cognitive decline. In a 26-week multi-site, home-based, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 120 cognitively healthy older adults (75 robust, 45 pre-frail; age range = 60-94) recruited from Switzerland, Canada, and Belgium were randomized to receive either the StayFitLonger (SFL) computerized multidomain training program or an active control intervention. Delivered on tablets, the SFL intervention combined adapted physical exercises (strength, balance, and mobility), cognitive training (divided attention, problem solving, and memory), opportunities for social and contributive interactions, and psychoeducation. The active control intervention provided basic mobilization exercises and access to video games. Cognitive outcomes were global cognition (Z-scores of attention, verbal fluency, and episodic memory for nondemented older adults; ZAVEN), memory, executive function, and processing speed. Linear mixed model analyses indicated improved performance on the ZAVEN global cognition score in the SFL group but not in the active control group. Stratified analyses by frailty status revealed improved ZAVEN global cognition and processing speed scores following SFL in the pre-frail group but not in the robust group. Overall, the study indicates that a computerized program providing a multidomain intervention at home can improve cognition in older adults. Importantly, pre-frail individuals, who are at higher risk of cognitive decline, seem to benefit more from the intervention.

A Mini-Review of Strategies for Recruiting Older African Americans to Alzheimer's Disease Research.,"African Americans experience higher incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, they continue to be underrepresented in AD research, limiting the ability to generalize findings to the increasingly diverse US population. To reduce AD disparities, targeted efforts are needed to increase the representation of African Americans in AD research. This mini review identified evidence-based strategies that increased research participation among older African Americans. Four recruitment strategies emerged from eight published peer-reviewed studies that directly evaluated the effectiveness of strategies aimed at increasing the number of African American participants in Alzheimer's research. The strategies include community outreach and education, face-to-face discussions, remote access, and referral and partnership with local organizations. Across different locations, these strategies increased the number of African Americans enrolled into AD research, the number of people that signed up to donate their brains for AD research upon death, and the knowledge and perception of AD in the communities. Targeted efforts are effective in increasing AD research participation among older African Americans, especially when combined with approaches that emphasize transparency and mutual trust and involve the community as stakeholders in the research process.",2024,"alzheimer’s; black; clinical trials; dementia; recruitment, and aging",Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Black or African American; Patient Selection; Aged; Biomedical Research; United States; Community-Institutional Relations,"Esiaka, D; Yarborough, CC; Fausto, BA; Gluck, MA"

To BYOD or not: Are device latencies important for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) smartphone cognitive testing?,"Studies using remote cognitive testing must make a critical decision: whether to allow participants to use their own devices or to provide participants with a study-specific device. Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) studies have several advantages including increased accessibility, potential for larger sample sizes, and reduced participant burden. However, BYOD studies offer little control over device performance characteristics that could potentially influence results. In particular, response times measured by each device not only include the participant's true response time, but also latencies of the device itself. The present study investigated two prominent sources of device latencies that pose significant risks to data quality: device display output latency and touchscreen input latency. We comprehensively tested 26 popular smartphones ranging in price from < $100 to $1000+ running either Android or iOS to determine if hardware and operating system differences led to appreciable device latency variability. To accomplish this, a custom-built device called the Latency and Timing Assessment Robot (LaTARbot) measured device display output and capacitive touchscreen input latencies. We found considerable variability across smartphones in display and touch latencies which, if unaccounted for, could be misattributed as individual or group differences in response times. Specifically, total device (sum of display and touch) latencies ranged from 35 to 140 ms. We offer recommendations to researchers to increase the precision of data collection and analysis in the context of remote BYOD studies.",2023,Ambulatory assessment; BYOD; Remote assessment; Smartphones,"Humans; Smartphone; Computers, Handheld; Data Collection; Software","Nicosia, J; Wang, B; Aschenbrenner, AJ; Sliwinski, MJ; Yabiku, ST; Roque, NA; Germine, LT; Bateman, RJ; Morris, JC; Hassenstab, J"

Contactless remote monitoring of sleep: evaluating the feasibility of an under-mattress sensor mat in a real-life deployment.,"Sleep is so important, particularly for the elderly. The lack of sleep may increase the risk of cognitive decline. Similarly, it may also increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, many people underestimate the importance of getting enough rest and sleep. In-laboratory polysomnography is the gold-standard method for assessing the quality of sleep. This method is considered impractical in the clinical environment, seen as labour-intensive and expensive owing to its specialised equipment, leading to long waiting lists. Hence, user-friendly (remote and non-intrusive) devices are being developed to help patients monitor their sleep at home. In this paper, we first discuss commercially-available non-wearable devices that measure sleep, in which we highlight the features associated with each device, including sensor type, interface, outputs, dimensions, power supply, and connectivity. Second, we evaluate the feasibility of a non-wearable device in a free-living environment. The deployed device comprises a sensor mat with an integrated micro-bending multimode fibre. Raw sensor data were gathered from five senior participants living in a senior activity centre over a few to several weeks. We were able to analyse the participants' sleep quality using various sleep parameters deduced from the sensor mat. These parameters include the wake-up time, bedtime, the time in bed, nap time. Vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and body movements, were also reported to detect abnormal sleep patterns. We have employed pre-and post-surveys reporting each volunteer's sleep hygiene to confirm the proposed system's outcomes for detecting the various sleep parameters. The results of the system were strongly correlated with the surveys for reporting each sleep parameter. Furthermore, the system proved to be highly effective in detecting irregular patterns that occurred during sleep.",2023,Sleep monitoring; User-Friendly devices; ballistocardiography; contactless sensors; heart rate; respiratory rate; smart home devices,,"Sadek, I; Abdulrazak, B"
