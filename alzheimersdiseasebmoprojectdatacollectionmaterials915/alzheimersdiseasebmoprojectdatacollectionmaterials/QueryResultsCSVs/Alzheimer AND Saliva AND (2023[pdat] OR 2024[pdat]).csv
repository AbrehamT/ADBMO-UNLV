Evaluation of core Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in saliva and plasma measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays on a fully automated platform.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid peptide beta-42 (Aβ42), Aβ42/40 ratio, and phosphorylated tau (pTau), are precious tools for supporting AD diagnosis. However, their use in clinical practice is limited due to the invasiveness of CSF collection. Thus, there is intensive research to find alternative, noninvasive, and widely accessible biological matrices to measure AD core biomarkers. In this study, we measured AD core biomarkers in saliva and plasma by a fully automated platform. We enrolled all consecutive patients with cognitive decline. For each patient, we measured Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau levels in CSF, saliva, and plasma by Lumipulse G1200 (Fujirebio). We included forty-two patients, of whom 27 had AD. Levels of all biomarkers significantly differed in the three biofluids, with saliva having the lowest and CSF the highest levels of Aβ42, Aβ40, and pTau. A positive correlation of pTau, Aβ42/40 ratio, and pTau/Aβ42 ratio levels in CSF and plasma was detected, while no correlation between any biomarker in CSF and saliva was found. Our findings suggest that plasma but not saliva could represent a surrogate biofluid for measuring core AD biomarkers. Specifically, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, pTau/Aβ42 ratio, and pTau could serve as surrogates of the corresponding CSF biomarkers.",2024,AD; Beta-amyloid; Biomarker; Fujirebio; Plasma; Saliva; Tau,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Saliva; Biomarkers; Female; Male; Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments; Luminescent Measurements; Aged, 80 and over","Agnello, L; Giglio, RV; Del Ben, F; Piccoli, T; Colletti, T; Scazzone, C; Lo Sasso, B; Ciaccio, AM; Gambino, CM; Salemi, G; Ciaccio, M"
Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common neurodegenerative disorders. AD is characterized by deposition of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, leading to associated secondary pathologies, progressive neurodegeneration, and eventually death. Currently used diagnostics are largely image-based, lack accuracy and do not detect early disease, ie, prior to onset of symptoms, thus limiting treatment options and outcomes. Although biomarkers such as amyloid-β and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid have gained much attention, these are generally limited to disease progression. Unfortunately, identification of biomarkers for early and accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. As such, body fluids such as sweat, serum, saliva, mucosa, tears, and urine are under investigation as alternative sources for biomarkers that can aid in early disease detection. This review focuses on biomarkers identified through proteomics in various biofluids and their potential for early and accurate diagnosis of AD.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Biofluid; Biomarker; Blood; CSF; Diagnosis; Saliva; Sweat; Tears,,"Rajendran, K; Krishnan, UM"
Sex-steroid hormones relate to cerebellar structure and functional connectivity across adulthood.,"Aging involves complex biological changes that affect disease susceptibility and aging trajectories. Although females typically live longer than males, they have a higher susceptibility to diseases like Alzheimer's, speculated to be influenced by menopause, and reduced ovarian hormone production. Understanding sex-specific differences is crucial for personalized medical interventions and gender equality in health. Our study aims to elucidate sex differences in regional cerebellar structure and connectivity during normal aging by investigating both structural and functional connectivity variations, with a focus on investigating these differences in the context of sex-steroid hormones. The study included 138 participants (mean age = 57(13.3) years, age range = 35-86 years, 54% women). The cohort was divided into three groups: 38 early middle-aged individuals (EMA) (mean age = 41(4.7) years), 48 late middle-aged individuals (LMA) (mean age = 58(4) years), and 42 older adults (OA) (mean age = 72(6.3) years). All participants underwent MRI scans, and saliva samples were collected for sex-steroid hormone quantification (17β-estradiol (E), progesterone (P), and testosterone (T)). We found less connectivity in females between Lobule I-IV and the cuneus, and greater connectivity in females between Crus I, Crus II, and the precuneus with increased age. Higher 17β-estradiol levels were linked to greater connectivity in Crus I and Crus II cerebellar subregions. Analyzing all participants together, testosterone was associated with both higher and lower connectivity in Lobule I-IV and Crus I, respectively, while higher progesterone levels were linked to lower connectivity in females. Structural differences were observed, with EMA males having larger volumes compared to LMA and OA groups, particularly in the right I-IV, right Crus I, right V, and right VI. EMA females showed higher volumes in the right lobules V and VI. These results highlight the significant role of sex hormones in modulating cerebellar connectivity and structure across adulthood, emphasizing the need to consider sex and hormonal status in neuroimaging studies to better understand age-related cognitive decline and neurological disorders.",2024,,,"Magalhães, TNC; Hicks, TH; Jackson, TB; Ballard, HK; Herrejon, IA; Bernard, JA"
"The PREVENT dementia programme: baseline demographic, lifestyle, imaging and cognitive data from a midlife cohort study investigating risk factors for dementia.","PREVENT is a multi-centre prospective cohort study in the UK and Ireland that aims to examine midlife risk factors for dementia and identify and describe the earliest indices of disease development. The PREVENT dementia programme is one of the original epidemiological initiatives targeting midlife as a critical window for intervention in neurodegenerative conditions. This paper provides an overview of the study protocol and presents the first summary results from the initial baseline data to describe the cohort. Participants in the PREVENT cohort provide demographic data, biological samples (blood, saliva, urine and optional cerebrospinal fluid), lifestyle and psychological questionnaires, undergo a comprehensive cognitive test battery and are imaged using multi-modal 3-T MRI scanning, with both structural and functional sequences. The PREVENT cohort governance structure is described, which includes a steering committee, a scientific advisory board and core patient and public involvement groups. A number of sub-studies that supplement the main PREVENT cohort are also described. The PREVENT cohort baseline data include 700 participants recruited between 2014 and 2020 across five sites in the UK and Ireland (Cambridge, Dublin, Edinburgh, London and Oxford). At baseline, participants had a mean age of 51.2 years (range 40-59, SD ± 5.47), with the majority female (",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; brain health; observational cohort; preclinical dementia; risk factors,,"Ritchie, CW; Bridgeman, K; Gregory, S; O'Brien, JT; Danso, SO; Dounavi, ME; Carriere, I; Driscoll, D; Hillary, R; Koychev, I; Lawlor, B; Naci, L; Su, L; Low, A; Mak, E; Malhotra, P; Manson, J; Marioni, R; Murphy, L; Ntailianis, G; Stewart, W; Muniz-Terrera, G; Ritchie, K"

Sialic acid metabolism of oral bacteria and its potential role in colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease.,"Sialic acid metabolism in oral bacteria is a complex process involving nutrient acquisition, immune evasion, cell surface modification, and the production of metabolites that contribute to bacterial persistence and virulence in the oral cavity. In addition to causing various periodontal diseases, certain oral pathogenic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, can induce inflammatory reactions and influence the immunity of host cells. These associations with host cells are linked to various diseases, particularly colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Sialic acid can be found in the host oral mucosa, saliva, or food residues in the oral cavity, and it may promote the colonization of oral bacteria and contribute to disease development. This review aims to summarize the role of sialic acid metabolism in oral bacteria and discuss its effect on the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Colorectal cancer; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Sialic acid metabolism,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; N-Acetylneuraminic Acid; Colorectal Neoplasms; Mouth; Bacteria; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Animals,"Zhu, J; Li, M; Li, J; Wu, J"
Polygenic Risk Score-Based Association Analysis Identifies Genetic Comorbidities Associated with Age-Related Hearing Difficulty in Two Independent Samples.,"Age-related hearing loss is the most common form of permanent hearing loss that is associated with various health traits, including Alzheimer's disease, cognitive decline, and depression. The present study aims to identify genetic comorbidities of age-related hearing loss. Past genome-wide association studies identified multiple genomic loci involved in common adult-onset health traits. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) could summarize the polygenic inheritance and quantify the genetic susceptibility of complex traits independent of trait expression. The present study conducted a PRS-based association analysis of age-related hearing difficulty in the UK Biobank sample (N = 425,240), followed by a replication analysis using hearing thresholds (HTs) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in 242 young adults with self-reported normal hearing. We hypothesized that young adults with genetic comorbidities associated with age-related hearing difficulty would exhibit subclinical decline in HTs and DPOAEs in both ears.",2024,Age-related hearing difficulty; Age-related hearing loss; Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions; Extended-high frequency audiometry; Hearing loss; Polygenic risk scores; Presbycusis,,"Bhatt, IS; Raygoza Garay, JA; Bhagavan, SG; Ingalls, V; Dias, R; Torkamani, A"
Salivary biomarkers: The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"The precise identification of Alzheimer's disease and other prevalent neurodegenerative diseases remains a difficult issue that requires the development of early detection of the disease and inexpensive biomarkers that can replace the present cerebrospinal fluid and imaging biomarkers. Blood biomarkers, such as amyloid and neurofilament light, have been emphasized as an important and practical tool in a testing or examination procedure thanks to advancements in ultra-sensitive detection techniques. Although saliva is not currently being researched for neurodegenerative diseases, it is an important source of biomarkers that can be used for the identification of diseases and has some advantages over other biofluids. While this may be true for most people, getting saliva from elderly people presents some significant challenges. In this overview, we will first discuss how saliva is created and how aging-related illnesses may affect the amount and kind of saliva produced. The findings support the use of salivary amyloid protein, tau species, and novel biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; biomarkers; early diagnosis; saliva,,"Nazir, S"

Molecular Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Practical Guide to Their Appropriate Use and Interpretation in Clinical Practice.,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) represent a group of different diseases characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of the nervous system's cells. The diagnosis is challenging, especially in the early stages, due to no specific clinical signs and symptoms. In this context, laboratory medicine could support clinicians in detecting and differentiating NDs. Indeed, biomarkers could indicate the pathological mechanisms underpinning NDs. The ideal biofluid for detecting the biomarkers of NDs is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which has limitations, hampering its widespread use in clinical practice. However, intensive efforts are underway to introduce high-sensitivity analytical methods to detect ND biomarkers in alternative nonivasive biofluid, such as blood or saliva. This study presents an overview of the ND molecular biomarkers currently used in clinical practice. For some diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis, biomarkers are well established and recommended by guidelines. However, for most NDs, intensive research is ongoing to identify reliable and specific biomarkers, and no consensus has yet been achieved.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; biomarker; laboratory medicine; neurodegeneration,Humans; Biomarkers; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Alzheimer Disease,"Agnello, L; Gambino, CM; Ciaccio, AM; Masucci, A; Vassallo, R; Tamburello, M; Scazzone, C; Lo Sasso, B; Ciaccio, M"

Feasibility of Oral Function Evaluation According to Dementia Severity in Older Adults with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Oral function evaluation in older adults with dementia is important for determining appropriate and practical dietary support plans; however, it can be challenging due to their difficulties in comprehending instructions and cooperating during assessments. The feasibility of oral function evaluation has not been well studied. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the feasibility of oral function evaluation in older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's Disease (FAST) stages. In total, 428 older adults with AD (45 men and 383 women; mean age: 87.2 ± 6.2 years) were included. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the prevalence of participants who were unable to perform oral function evaluations, including oral diadochokinesis (ODK), repeated saliva swallow test (RSST), and modified water swallow test (MWST). In comparison to the reference category (combined FAST stage 1-3), FAST stage 7 was associated with the infeasibility of ODK (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval = 26.7, 4.2-168.6), RSST (5.9, 2.2-16.1), and MWST (8.7, 1.6-48.5, respectively).

Salivary Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease which manifests with progressive cognitive impairment, leading to dementia. Considering the noninvasive collection of saliva, we designed the systematic review to answer the question ""Are salivary biomarkers reliable for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease?"" Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 studies were included in this systematic review (according to the PRISMA statement guidelines). Potential biomarkers include mainly proteins, metabolites and even miRNAs. Based on meta-analysis, in AD patients, salivary levels of beta-amyloid42 and p-tau levels were significantly increased, and t-tau and lactoferrin were decreased at borderline statistical significance. However, according to pooled AUC, lactoferrin and beta-amyloid42 showed a significant predictive value for salivary-based AD diagnosis. In conclusion, potential markers such as beta-amyloid42, tau and lactoferrin can be detected in the saliva of AD patients, which could reliably support the early diagnosis of this neurodegenerative disease.",2024,Alzheimer’s Disease; beta-amyloid; biomarkers; lactoferrin; neurodegenerative diseases; saliva; tau,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Lactoferrin; MicroRNAs; Biomarkers,"Nijakowski, K; Owecki, W; Jankowski, J; Surdacka, A"

NMR-based metabolomics in Alzheimer's disease research: a review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population worldwide. Currently, there is no cure for AD, and the continuous increase in the number of susceptible individuals poses one of the most significant emerging threats to public health. However, the molecular pathways involved in the onset and progression of AD are not fully understood. This information is crucial for developing less invasive diagnostic instruments and discovering novel potential therapeutic targets. Metabolomics studies the complete ensemble of endogenous and exogenous metabolites present in biological specimens and may provide an interesting approach to identify alterations in multiple biochemical processes associated with AD onset and evolution. In this mini review, we summarize the results from metabolomic studies conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on human biological samples (blood derivatives, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, and tissues) from AD patients. We describe the metabolic alterations identified in AD patients compared to controls and to patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Effectiveness of the Stress Process Model-Based Program in Dementia Caregiving (DeCare-SPM) for Family Caregivers: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"This paper aims to describe a randomized controlled trial protocol evaluating the effectiveness, cost, and process of a stress process model-based program in dementia caregiving (DeCare-SPM) for family caregivers. Family caregivers of individuals with dementia will be recruited from memory clinics and community settings and randomly assigned to either DeCare-SPM or usual care. DeCare-SPM comprises three face-to-face sessions (ie, problem-based coping, emotion-based coping, meaning-based coping), and a fourth session (ie, social support) including weekly telephone-based consultation for four weeks and then monthly face-to-face boosters. Outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), and at one (T1), three (T2), and six months (T3). The primary outcome is positive aspects of caregiving and secondary outcomes are caregiving (ie, sense of competence, caregiver burden, social support, anxiety, depression, and quality of life), dementia-related (ie, care dependency, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life), and stress-related biomarkers of blood and saliva. In addition, process and economic evaluations will be performed. Mixed-effects models will be used to assess intervention effects. Content analysis will be performed on the qualitative data. This paper described the protocol for comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness, cost, and process of the theory-driven DeCare-SPM to inform how and why interventions work. It highlights the need to reduce challenges and enhance the positive aspects of dementia care. The DeCare-SPM will provide evidence-based insights into how to support and empower family caregivers in their important roles, thereby, leading to improved dementia care.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; community; informal caregivers; psychosocial; stress coping,,"Wang, J; Chen, H; Yang, L; Yu, X; Zhang, D; Zhao, Q; Xiao, M"

Risk factors and prevention of choking.,"Choking (or foreign body airway obstruction) is a widespread phenomenon with serious consequences of morbidity and mortality. Choking (often also called suffocation) can be caused by food or inedible objects and leads to various degrees of asphyxiation or lack of oxygen in the blood stream. The incidence is very high in both young children and adults, especially seniors. However, since not all choking episodes end up in the emergency room or become fatalities, they often escape statistics. Although episodes of choking from non-edible bodies are infrequent, they affect mostly young children. Three of the most common risks for choking in general are neurological disorders, dysphagia and dental issues (few or no teeth, unstable or unsuitable prosthesis or orthodontic appliances).  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of choking and ways to reduce/avoid this event. We reported data on a series of 138 patients admitted to the emergency department following a choking event, at a hospital in Rome, Italy. The age group of the analyzed population ranged from 1 to 88 years, with the most represented age group of these between 40 and 59, with a similar distribution between males and females. The types of foods on which people choked reflected the seasonal, traditional and local foods: 67% of patients reported choking on fish bones followed by meat bones (9%)  and artichokes (3%). Three relevant non-food choking elements reported were: orthodontic items, toothpicks and pins (one occurrence each). We also reported on two clinical cases of patients choking on meat and a chicken bone. In conclusion, choking awareness and prevention are essential for implementing potential life-saving precautions. Prevention is the first tool to reduce the occurrence of this event, therefore it is necessary to analyze the risk factors and educate the population to eliminate them.

Systematic review: fluid biomarkers and machine learning methods to improve the diagnosis from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered an early stage of dementia, with estimated rates of progression to dementia up to 80-90% after approximately 6 years from the initial diagnosis. Diagnosis of cognitive impairment in dementia is typically based on clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessments, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The main goal of diagnosing MCI is to determine its cause, particularly whether it is due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, only a limited percentage of the population has access to etiological confirmation, which has led to the emergence of peripheral fluid biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for dementias, including MCI due to AD. Recent advances in biofluid assays have enabled the use of sophisticated statistical models and multimodal machine learning (ML) algorithms for the diagnosis of MCI based on fluid biomarkers from CSF, peripheral blood, and saliva, among others. This approach has shown promise for identifying specific causes of MCI, including AD. After a PRISMA analysis, 29 articles revealed a trend towards using multimodal algorithms that incorporate additional biomarkers such as neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and genetic information. Particularly, neuroimaging is commonly used in conjunction with fluid biomarkers for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our systematic review suggests that cost-effective longitudinal multimodal monitoring data, representative of diverse cultural populations and utilizing white-box ML algorithms, could be a valuable contribution to the development of diagnostic models for AD due to MCI. Clinical assessment and biomarkers, together with ML techniques, could prove pivotal in improving diagnostic tools for MCI due to AD.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Fluid biomarker; Machine learning; Mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Cognitive Dysfunction; Biomarkers; Machine Learning; Amyloid beta-Peptides; tau Proteins,"Blanco, K; Salcidua, S; Orellana, P; Sauma-Pérez, T; León, T; Steinmetz, LCL; Ibañez, A; Duran-Aniotz, C; de la Cruz, R"
Determination of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II and secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva of patients with dementia.,"The prevalence of pain and dementia increases with age, affecting a significant percentage of the population due to aging. Both pathologies are connected through the inflammatory process, specifically through the tumor necrosis factor. The effect of this cytokine is mediated through the modulation of its TNFRI and TNFRII receptors, which are linked to the dementia process. In addition, immunoglobulins such as secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) have been recognized as one of the main biomarkers of pain in saliva. sTNFRII and sIgA levels were determined in saliva samples by ELISA from healthy people and patients with dementia in GDS stages 5-7. The concentrations of these markers were also correlated with the GDS stage and sex. We observed a significant decrease (*** p ≤ 0.001) in the levels of sTNFRII (pg/mL) and a significant increase (** p ≤ 0.01) in the levels of sIgA (ng/mL) in the saliva of patients with dementia compared to the healthy control group. We did not observe a correlation with the data of the biomarkers regarding the GDS stage and sex. The results obtained for sTNFRII are consistent with those obtained by other authors on brain tissue, who conclude that unopposed neuronal TNFRI signaling, when TNFRII is selectively downregulated, leads to a more severe course of AD pathogenesis. Regarding sIgA, the elevated values of sIgA may reflect the immune status of these patients. Therefore, these biomarkers can provide us with relevant information through a non-invasive method such as saliva analysis.",2023,Alzheimer disease; Dementia; Inflammation; Pain; STNFRII; sIgA,,"Cantón-Habas, V; Rich-Ruiz, M; Martínez-Martos, JM; Ramírez-Expósito, MJ; Carrera-González, MP"

Self-Administered Gentle Yoga and Yoga Breathing Intervention Improves Burden and Stress Biomarkers in Caregivers of Persons Living with Dementia.,"Family caregivers of adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the fastest growing group of informal healthcare providers in the United States. These individuals experience high levels of stress and physical and psychosocial symptoms related to their caregiving role. We provided 20 ADRD caregivers (≥ 55 years of age) with training and access to a mobile health app for at-home practice of gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises. Here, we report secondary outcomes, including changes in caregiver physical and mental function, burden, fatigue, sleep, and biological stress markers (salivary cortisol and 1,5-anhydroglucitol [1,5-AG] assays) from Baseline (Week 1) to Study End (Week 12). Self-reported questionnaire data were collected online via the Research Electronic Data Capture system, and biomarker data were collected via saliva samples. Results supported indications for slight improvement in outcomes of caregiving burden among ADRD caregivers using the gentle yoga and yoga breathing app. Furthermore, slight improvements in mental health were observed; the greatest gains were made by those reporting higher burden and having family members with more severe dementias. Findings indicate that those experiencing the greatest improvement in caregiver burden scores spent the most time doing gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises. Salivary stress biomarkers moved in a favorable direction (decreased cortisol; increased 1,5-AG) among caregivers practicing the exercises most often. This is among the first studies of gentle yoga and yoga breathing exercises for relieving ADRD caregiver burden and the first we are aware of to incorporate stress biomarker measurement.",2023,Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; caregivers; mindfulness intervention; mobile health; stress biomarkers; yoga,Adult; Humans; Caregivers; Yoga; Hydrocortisone; Dementia; Biomarkers,"Balasubramanian, S; Mueller, M; Madisetti, M; Hendrix, K; Kelechi, TJ"
Alteration of Neural Network and Hippocampal Slice Activation through Exosomes Derived from 5XFAD Nasal Lavage Fluid.,"Exosomes, key mediators of intercellular transmission of pathogenic proteins, such as amyloid-beta and tau, significantly influence the progression and exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Present in a variety of biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, saliva, and nasal lavage fluid (NLF), exosomes underscore their potential as integral mediators of AD pathology. By serving as vehicles for disease-specific molecules, exosomes could unveil valuable insights into disease identification and progression. This study emphasizes the imperative to investigate the impacts of exosomes on neural networks to enhance our comprehension of intracerebral neuronal communication and its implications for neurological disorders like AD. After harvesting exosomes derived from NLF of 5XFAD mice, we utilized a high-density multielectrode array (HD-MEA) system, the novel technology enabling concurrent recordings from thousands of neurons in primary cortical neuron cultures and organotypic hippocampal slices. The ensuing results revealed a surge in neuronal firing rates and disoriented neural connectivity, reflecting the effects provoked by pathological amyloid-beta oligomer treatment. The local field potentials in the exosome-treated hippocampal brain slices also exhibited aberrant rhythmicity, along with an elevated level of current source density. While this research is an initial exploration, it highlights the potential of exosomes in modulating neural networks under AD conditions and endorses the HD-MEA as an efficacious tool for exosome studies.",2023,5XFAD; exosome; high-density multielectrode array; hippocampal slice; nasal lavage fluid; neural network,Mice; Animals; Exosomes; Nasal Lavage Fluid; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Hippocampus,"Kim, S; Jeon, J; Ganbat, D; Kim, T; Shin, K; Hong, S; Hong, J"
Obesity reduces hippocampal structure and function in older African Americans with the APOE-ε4 Alzheimer's disease risk allele.,"Excess body weight and Alzheimer's disease (AD) disproportionately affect older African Americans. While mid-life obesity increases risk for AD, few data exist on the relationship between late-life obesity and AD, or how obesity-based and genetic risk for AD interact. Although the APOE-ε4 allele confers a strong genetic risk for AD, it is unclear if late-life obesity poses a greater risk for APOE-ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers. Here we assessed: (1) the influence of body mass index (BMI) (normal; overweight; class 1 obese; ≥ class 2 obese) on cognitive and structural MRI measures of AD risk; and (2) the interaction between BMI and APOE-ε4 in older African Americans.",2023,body mass index; cognitive function; dementia; medial temporal lobe; underrepresented populations,,"Osiecka, Z; Fausto, BA; Gills, JL; Sinha, N; Malin, SK; Gluck, MA"

A Protease-Responsive Polymer/Peptide Conjugate and Reversible Assembly of Silver Clusters for the Detection of ,"We report the reversible aggregation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) assemblies using the combination of a cationic arginine-based peptide and sulfur-capped polyethylene glycol (PEG). The formation and dissociation of the aggregates were studied by optical methods and electron microscopy. The dissociation of silver clusters depends on the peptide sequence and PEG size. A molecular weight of 1 kDa for PEG was optimal for the dissociation. The most important feature of this dissociation method is that it can operate in complex biofluids such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell media, or even seawater without a significant decrease in performance. Moreover, the peptide-particle assemblies are highly stable and do not degrade (or express of loss of signal upon dissociation) when dried and resolubilized, frozen and thawed, or left in daylight for a month. Importantly, the dissociation capacity of PEG can be reduced via the conjugation of a peptide-cleavable substrate. The dissociation capacity is restored in the presence of an enzyme. Based on these findings, we designed a PEG-peptide hybrid molecule specific to the ",2023,P. gingivalis; PEG; peptides; periodontitis; protease sensing; reversible assembly; silver nanoparticles,Peptide Hydrolases; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Silver; Polymers; Metal Nanoparticles; Endopeptidases; Peptides; Polyethylene Glycols,"Retout, M; Amer, L; Yim, W; Creyer, MN; Lam, B; Trujillo, DF; Potempa, J; O'Donoghue, AJ; Chen, C; Jokerst, JV"
Non-invasive Biomarkers for Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease: a New-Age Perspective.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly population. It gradually leads to memory loss, loss of thinking ability, and an overall cognitive decline. However, exhaustive literature is available to suggest that pathological changes in the brain occur decades before the first clinical symptoms appear. This review provides insight into the non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of AD that have been successfully studied in populations across the globe. These biomarkers have been detected in the blood, saliva, breath, and urine samples. Retinal imaging techniques are also reported. In this study, PubMed and Google scholar were the databases employed using keywords ""Alzheimer's disease,"" ""neurodegeneration,"" ""non-invasive biomarkers,"" ""early diagnosis,"" ""blood-based biomarkers,"" and ""preclinical AD,"" among others. The evaluation of these biomarkers will provide early diagnosis of AD in the preclinical stages due to their positive correlation with brain pathology in AD.

A top-down proteomic approach reveals a salivary protein profile able to classify Parkinson's disease with respect to Alzheimer's disease patients and to healthy controls.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with motor and non-motor symptoms. Diagnosis is complicated by lack of reliable biomarkers. To individuate peptides and/or proteins with diagnostic potential for early diagnosis, severity and discrimination from similar pathologies, the salivary proteome in 36 PD patients was investigated in comparison with 36 healthy controls (HC) and 35 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A top-down platform based on HPLC-ESI-IT-MS allowed characterizing and quantifying intact peptides, small proteins and their PTMs (overall 51). The three groups showed significantly different protein profiles, PD showed the highest levels of cystatin SA and antileukoproteinase and the lowest of cystatin SN and some statherin proteoforms. HC exhibited the lowest abundance of thymosin β4, short S100A9, cystatin A, and dimeric cystatin B. AD patients showed the highest abundance of α-defensins and short oxidized S100A9. Moreover, different proteoforms of the same protein, as S-cysteinylated and S-glutathionylated cystatin B, showed opposite trends in the two pathological groups. Statherin, cystatins SA and SN classified accurately PD from HC and AD subjects. α-defensins, histatin 1, oxidized S100A9, and P-B fragments were the best classifying factors between PD and AD patients. Interestingly statherin and thymosin β4 correlated with defective olfactory functions in PD patients. All these outcomes highlighted implications of specific proteoforms involved in the innate-immune response and inflammation regulation at oral and systemic level, suggesting a possible panel of molecular and clinical markers suitable to recognize subjects affected by PD.",2024,Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease; S100A9; cystatins; salivary proteomics,Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cystatin B; Proteomics; Parkinson Disease; Neurodegenerative Diseases; alpha-Defensins; Saliva; Salivary Proteins and Peptides; Transcription Factors; Biomarkers,"Contini, C; Fadda, L; Lai, G; Masala, C; Olianas, A; Castagnola, M; Messana, I; Iavarone, F; Bizzarro, A; Masullo, C; Solla, P; Defazio, G; Manconi, B; Diaz, G; Cabras, T"

AD is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders; it is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Specific demographic factors and genetic variants have been identified in non-Hispanic populations; however, limited studies have observed the Hispanic population. Therefore, we focused on investigating a known gene, APOE, associated with AD-related phenotypes and two psychiatric diseases (depression and anxiety) within the U.S. Hispanic population in our current study.

Liquid Biopsy in Neurological Diseases.,"The most recent and non-invasive approach for studying early-stage biomarkers is liquid biopsy. This implies the extraction and analysis of non-solid biological tissues (serum, plasma, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid) without undergoing invasive procedures to determine disease prognosis. Liquid biopsy can be used for the screening of several components, such as extracellular vesicles, microRNAs, cell-free DNA, cell-free mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, transfer RNA, and circular DNA or RNA derived from body fluids. Its application includes early disease diagnosis, the surveillance of disease activity, and treatment response monitoring, with growing evidence for validating this methodology in cancer, liver disease, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This review will provide an overview of mentioned liquid biopsy components, which could serve as valuable biomarkers for the evaluation of complex neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, CNS tumours, and neuroinfectious diseases.

In this study, an objective sleep analysis was performed using actigraphy, and IL-6 measurements in saliva in 61 older people residing in long-term nursing homes (72.1% women). Almost half (49.2%) of the people had no or mild cognitive impairment, and the rest suffered from moderate to severe dementia, mainly due to Alzheimer's disease (25 out of 31 individuals).

The role of exosomes in adult neurogenesis: implications for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Exosomes are cup-shaped extracellular vesicles with a lipid bilayer that is approximately 30 to 200 nm in thickness. Exosomes are widely distributed in a range of body fluids, including urine, blood, milk, and saliva. Exosomes exert biological function by transporting factors between different cells and by regulating biological pathways in recipient cells. As an important form of intercellular communication, exosomes are increasingly being investigated due to their ability to transfer bioactive molecules such as lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs between cells, and because they can regulate physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system. Adult neurogenesis is a multistage process by which new neurons are generated and migrate to be integrated into existing neuronal circuits. In the adult brain, neurogenesis is mainly localized in two specialized niches: the subventricular zone adjacent to the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. An increasing body of evidence indicates that adult neurogenesis is tightly controlled by environmental conditions with the niches. In recent studies, exosomes released from different sources of cells were shown to play an active role in regulating neurogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, thereby participating in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders in patients and in various disease models. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art synopsis of existing research that aimed to identify the diverse components of exosome cargoes and elucidate the therapeutic potential of exosomal contents in the regulation of neurogenesis in several neurodegenerative diseases. We emphasize that exosomal cargoes could serve as a potential biomarker to monitor functional neurogenesis in adults. In addition, exosomes can also be considered as a novel therapeutic approach to treat various neurodegenerative disorders by improving endogenous neurogenesis to mitigate neuronal loss in the central nervous system.",2024,Alzheimer’s disease; Huntington’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; adult neurogenesis; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; exosome; neurodegenerative disease; neurogenic niches,,"Yu, Z; Teng, Y; Yang, J; Yang, L"
Saliva: a challenging human fluid to diagnose brain disorders with a focus on Alzheimer's disease.,"Biomarkers are molecules of biological processes that help in both the diagnosis of human diseases and in follow-up assessments of therapeutic responses. Biomarkers can be measured in many human fluids, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva. The -omics methods (genomics, RNomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are useful at measuring thousands of markers in a small volume. Saliva is a human fluid that is easily accessible, without any ethical concerns. Yet, saliva remains unexplored in regard to many human disease biomarkers. In this review, we will give an overview on saliva and how it can be influenced by exogenous factors. As we focus on the potential use of saliva as a diagnostic tool in brain disorders (especially Alzheimer's disease), we will cover how saliva is linked to the brain. We will discuss that saliva is a heterogeneous human fluid, yet useful for the discovery of biomarkers in human disorders.

Loss of Y chromosome in leukocytes can be regarded as a male-specific age predictor for age group estimation in forensic genetics.,"Age prediction is an important field in forensic and aging research. Traditional methods used DNA methylation, telomere shortening, and mitochondrial DNA mutations to conduct age prediction models. Sex chromosomes, like the Y chromosome, have a significant role in aging as previously reported in hematopoietic disease and many non-reproductive cancers. Until now, there is no age predictor based on the percentage of loss of Y chromosome (LOY). LOY has been previously revealed to be correlated with Alzheimer's disease, short survival, and higher risk of cancer. The possible correlation of LOY between normal aging was not fully explored. In this study, we conducted age prediction by measuring LOY percentage by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), based on 232 healthy male samples, including 171 blood samples, 49 saliva samples, 12 semen samples. The age group of samples ranges from 0 to 99 years, with two individuals in almost every single age. Pearson correlation method was performed to calculate the correlation index. The result indicated a correlation index of 0.21 (p = 0.0059) between age and LOY percentage in blood samples, with the regression formula being y = - 0.016823 + 0.001098x. The correlation between LOY percentage and age is obvious only when the individuals were divided into different age groups (R = 0.73, p = 0.016). In the studied saliva and semen samples, p-values of the correlation are 0.11 and 0.20, respectively, showing no significant association between age and LOY percentage in these two biological materials. For the first time, we investigated male-specific age predictor based on LOY. The study showed that LOY in leukocytes can be regarded as a male-specific age predictor for age group estimation in forensic genetics. This study might be indicative for forensic applications and aging research.",2023,Age prediction; Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR); Loss of Y chromosome (LOY),"Humans; Male; Infant, Newborn; Infant; Child, Preschool; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Forensic Genetics; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Leukocytes; Aging; Neoplasms","Song, M; Jiang, L; Wang, X; Zhou, W; Wang, N; Hou, Y; Song, F"

Mechano-Chemistry across Phase Transitions in Heated Albumin Protein Solutions.,"The presence of certain proteins in biofluids such as synovial fluid, blood plasma, and saliva gives these fluids non-Newtonian viscoelastic properties. The amount of these protein macromolecules in biofluids is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of various health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disorders, and joint quality. However, existing technologies for measuring the behavior of macromolecules in biofluids have limitations, such as long turnaround times, complex protocols, and insufficient sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose non-contact, optical Brillouin and Raman spectroscopy to assess the viscoelasticity and chemistry of non-Newtonian solutions, respectively, at different temperatures in several minutes. In this work, bovine and human serum albumin solution-based biopolymers were studied to obtain both their collective dynamics and molecular chemical evolution across heat-driven phase transitions at various protein concentrations. The observed phase transitions at elevated temperatures could be fully delayed in heated biopolymers by appropriately raising the level of protein concentration. The non-contact optical monitoring of viscoelastic and chemical property evolution could represent novel potential mechano-chemical biomarkers for disease diagnosis and subsequent treatment applications, including hyperthermia.",2023,Brillouin scattering; Raman scattering; albumin; denaturation; gelation; heating; mechano-chemical; phase transitions; polymer; protein; viscoelastic,,"Kharmyssov, C; Sekerbayev, K; Nurekeyev, Z; Gaipov, A; Utegulov, ZN"

Assessment of the Relationship between Non-motor features and Severity of Parkinson's Disease Patients in Bangladesh.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease that may present with both motor and non-motor symptoms (NMSs). Many of the ignored NMSs may potentiate further deterioration of the patient's quality of life (QoL). But there is scarcity of data regarding NMSs of PD patients and their relationship with the disease severity in Bangladesh. This study was aimed to investigate the frequency of NMSs and assess their debatable impact on the severity of PD patients in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional type of observational study was conducted in neurology department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from January 2012 to June 2013 which recruited 60 eligible PD patients. The PD patients and disease severity was demonstrated by UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD and the Hoehn and Yahr scale respectively. Whereas, NMSs were demonstrated by the self-structured questionnaire which had encountered 30 common symptoms of PD. The mean age of our study cohort was found 57.88±10.56 years with male female ration 2:1. According to the Hoehn and Yahr (H & Y) severity scale 38.3%, 38.3%, 20.1% and 3.3% patients had been suffering from stage ?, stage II, stage III and stage ?V Parkinson's disease respectively. Irrespective of the severity of the PD the frequency of NMSs was nocturia (66.7%), sadness or blues (65.0%), memory disturbance (61.7%), anxiety (58.3%), insomnia (56.7%), orthostatic hypotension (55.0%), erectile dysfunction (50.0%), urinary urgency (46.7%), anhedonia (45.0%), olfactory disturbance (38.3%), constipation (38.3%), hyper or hypo sexuality (31.7%) and restless leg syndrome (31.7%). However, after head-to-head NMSs analysis, daytime dribbling of saliva (p=0.024), urinary urgency (p=0.036), nocturia (p=0.001), weight loss (p=0.001), anhedonia (p=0.027), excessive daytime sleepiness (p=0.024), insomnia (p=0.007), vivid dream (p=0.024), REM behavior disorder (p=0.010), restless leg syndrome/ periodic leg movements (p=0.043) had significantly been reported higher among the stage II PD patients than that of stage I patients. Whereas fall (p=0.001), dysphagia or choking (p=0.002), constipation (p=0.003), fecal incontinence (p=0.033), excessive daytime sleepiness (p=0.033), anxiety (p=0.036) and anhedonia (p=0.044) were significantly more prevalent among the advanced stage (III) than stage (II) PD patients. Mean total NMS increased significantly with PD severity based on H and Y staging with a mean NMSQ-T (Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire Test) of 5.43 in stage 1, 9.22 in stage 2, 13.75 in stage 3 and 17.0 in stage 4 (p=0.0001). This study revealed that there was high frequency of NMSs among the PD patients and most common symptoms were nocturia, sadness, memory impairment, anxiety, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, anhedonia, urinary urgency and constipation. Finally, the more advanced disease as indicated by a higher H&Y stage was associated with significantly higher number of reported NMSs.",2023,,"Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Parkinson Disease; Quality of Life; Erectile Dysfunction; Nocturia; Anhedonia; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Cross-Sectional Studies; Bangladesh; Hypotension, Orthostatic; Restless Legs Syndrome; Constipation; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence; Severity of Illness Index","Rahman, SS; Acherjya, GK; Ali, M; Alam, MS; Mondal, G; Saha, K; Kabir, MS; Zahid, RI; Munna, NH; Debnath, CR"
Characterization of Cystatin B Interactome in Saliva from Healthy Elderly and Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"Cystatin B is a small, multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of inflammation, innate immune response, and neuronal protection and found highly abundant in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, our study demonstrated a significant association between the level of salivary cystatin B and AD. Since the protein is able to establish protein-protein interaction (PPI) in different contexts and aggregation-prone proteins and the PPI networks are relevant for AD pathogenesis, and due to the relevance of finding new AD markers in peripheral biofluids, we thought it was interesting to study the possible involvement of cystatin B in PPIs in saliva and to evaluate differences and similarities between AD and age-matched elderly healthy controls (HC). For this purpose, we applied a co-immunoprecipitation procedure and a bottom-up proteomics analysis to purify, identify, and quantify cystatin B interactors. Results demonstrated for the first time the existence of a salivary cystatin B-linked multi-protein complex composed by 82 interactors and largely expressed in the body. Interactors are involved in neutrophil activation, antimicrobial activity, modulation of the cytoskeleton and extra-cellular matrix (ECM), and glucose metabolism. Preliminary quantitative data showed significantly lower levels of triosophosphate isomerase 1 and higher levels of mucin 7, BPI, and matrix Gla protein in AD with respect to HC, suggesting implications associated with AD of altered glucose metabolism, antibacterial activities, and calcification-associated processes. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD039286 and PXD030679.",2023,affinity purification; alzheimer’s disease; bottom-up proteomics; cystatin B; interactome; mass spectrometry; saliva,,"Contini, C; Serrao, S; Manconi, B; Olianas, A; Iavarone, F; Guadalupi, G; Messana, I; Castagnola, M; Masullo, C; Bizzarro, A; Turck, CW; Maccarrone, G; Cabras, T"

Molecularly imprinted polymers for the recognition of biomarkers of certain neurodegenerative diseases.,"The appearance of the biomarkers in body fluids like blood, urine, saliva, tears, etc. can be used for the identification of many diseases. This article aimed to summarize the studies about electrochemical biosensors with molecularly imprinted polymers as sensitive and selective layers on the electrode to detect protein-based biomarkers of such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stress. The main attention in this article is focused on the detection methods of amyloid-β oligomers and p-Tau which are representative biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein as the biomarker of Parkinson's disease, and α-amylase and lysozyme as the biomarkers of stress using molecular imprinting technology. The research methods, the application of different electrodes, the influence of the polymers, and the established detection limits are reviewed and compared.",2023,Alzheimer’s disease biomarker; Electrochemical biosensor; Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP); Parkinson’s disease biomarker,Humans; Molecularly Imprinted Polymers; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Parkinson Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Molecular Imprinting; Electrodes; Electrochemical Techniques,"Pilvenyte, G; Ratautaite, V; Boguzaite, R; Samukaite-Bubniene, U; Plausinaitis, D; Ramanaviciene, A; Bechelany, M; Ramanavicius, A"
Using LC-MS/MS to Determine Salivary Steroid Reference Intervals in a European Older Adult Population.,"A number of steroids, including glucocorticoids and sex hormones, have been associated with neurodegenerative and cardiovascular conditions common in aging populations. The application of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) steroid analysis offers an opportunity to conduct simultaneous multiplex steroid analysis within a given sample. In this paper, we describe the application of an LC-MS/MS steroid analysis method for the assessment of reference ranges of steroids in human saliva samples (200 µL) collected from older adults (age 50 years and above) enrolled in a European cohort investigating the risk for Alzheimer's dementia. Saliva samples were prepared using supported liquid extraction (SLE) along with a calibration curve and analysed using a Waters I-Class UPLC (Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography) and a Sciex QTrap 6500+ mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry parameters of steroids were optimised for each steroid and a method for the chromatographic separation of 19 steroids was developed. Lower limits of quantitation (LLOQs), linearity and other method criteria were assessed. In total, data from 125 participants (500 samples) were analysed and assessed for reference ranges (64 male, 61 female). A total of 19 steroids were detected in saliva within the range of the method. There were clear diurnal patterns in most of the steroid hormones detected. Sex differences were observed for androstenedione (A4), testosterone (T), cortisone (E) and aldosterone (Aldo). In the first sample of the day, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was significantly higher in healthy volunteers compared to those with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. This LC-MS/MS method is suitable for the analysis of 19 steroids in saliva in adults.",2023,LC-MS/MS; saliva; steroid hormone; supported liquid extraction,,"Gregory, S; Denham, SG; Lee, P; Simpson, JP; Homer, NZM"
Salivary Aβ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia among the aging population. Cumulative studies aim to find non-invasive biomarkers in the early stages of AD. Saliva can be obtained easily, and salivary biomarkers have been proven effective in detecting neurodegenerative diseases.

A review on comparative studies addressing exosome isolation methods from body fluids.,"Exosomes emerged as valuable sources of disease biomarkers and new therapeutic tools. However, extracellular vesicles isolation with exosome-like characteristics from certain biofluids is still challenging which can limit their potential use in clinical settings. While ultracentrifugation-based procedures are the gold standard for exosome isolation from cell cultures, no unique and standardized method for exosome isolation from distinct body fluids exists. The complexity, specific composition, and physical properties of each biofluid constitute a technical barrier to obtain reproducible and pure exosome preparations, demanding a detailed characterization of both exosome isolation and characterization methods. Moreover, some isolation procedures can affect downstream proteomic or RNA profiling analysis. This review compiles and discussed a set of comparative studies addressing distinct exosome isolation methods from human biofluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, serum, saliva, and urine, also focusing on body fluid specific challenges, physical properties, and other potential variation sources. This summarized information will facilitate the choice of exosome isolation methods, based on the type of biological samples available, and hopefully encourage the use of exosomes in translational and clinical research.",2023,Biofluids; Extracellular vesicles; Isolation methods,Humans; Exosomes; Proteomics; Ultracentrifugation; Body Fluids; Cell Culture Techniques,"Martins, TS; Vaz, M; Henriques, AG"
