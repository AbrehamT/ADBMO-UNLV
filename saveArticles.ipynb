       "              'Abstract': 'Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent form of dementia, which is a gradual condition that begins with mild memory loss and progresses to difficulties communicating and responding to the environment. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques have resulted in large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data, leading to an increased interest in using deep learning for the early diagnosis and automated classification of Alzheimer’s disease. This study uses machine learning (ML) methods to determine the severity level of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI images, where the dataset consists of four levels of severity. A hybrid of 12 feature extraction methods is used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease severity, and six traditional machine learning methods are applied, including decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, linear discrimination analysis, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble learning methods. During training, optimization is performed to obtain the best solution for each classifier. Additionally, a CNN model is trained using a machine learning system algorithm to identify specific patterns. The accuracy of the Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Linear discrimination classifier, Decision tree, Ensembled learning, and presented CNN architecture are 67.5%, 72.3%, 74.5%, 65.6%, 62.4%, 73.8% and, 95.3%, respectively. Based on the results, the presented CNN approach outperforms other traditional machine learning methods to find Alzheimer severity.',\n",
       "              'Intro': 'Dogan et al. developed a model of primate brain patterns based on EEG signals for the detection of AD. Using a directed graph to extract features from the primate brain’s connectome, this method demonstrated high accuracy in identifying AD patients from healthy controls. In order to enhance the accuracy of AD detection, the model is able to generate a set of features from EEG signals. Using brain images, Kaplan et al. developed a feed-forward Local Phase Quantization Network (LPQNet) for AD detection. Based on feature generation and selection through multilevel processing, their model demonstrated remarkable classification accuracy across several datasets. LPQNet stands out for its combination of high accuracy and low computational complexity, which makes it a valuable tool for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. Kaplan et al. developed the ExHiF model for the detection of AD using CT and MR images. They combined exemplar histogram-based features with neighborhood component analysis to achieve 100% classification accuracy. In terms of medical image classification for AD, this model is innovative in its feature extraction process inspired by vision transformers. Table 1 provides a detailed comparison of related works that have leveraged ML to diagnose AD.',\n",
       "              'Method': 'The confusion matrix is a specific tool that accurately measures categorization performance. Learning a few definitions are required to understand the confusion matrix. But before we get into the theories, let’s look at a fundamental confusion matrix for binary or binomial classification with two classes (say, Y or N). The potential of a classifier to select all of the examples that must be chosen is referred to as sensitivity. A perfect classifier will determine all true Ys and exclude any true Ys. There will be no false negatives to express it in a different way. In the absence of a classifier, true Ys will be missed, resulting in false negatives. A classifier is defined as being accurate if it is able to select all instances that need to be picked and to reject all instances that need to be denied. Fig 2 illustrates the workflow and conceptual diagram in our proposed approach.',\n",
       "              'Results': 'To compare the presented CNN method with other machine learning approaches, the AUC values and accuracy of the methods are presented in Table 3. Based on the results, the accuracy and the AUC value for the presented CNN methods are higher than other machine learning classifiers. Moreover, the KNN method with 74.5% accuracy and 92% AUC is the second classification priority. Furthermore, the ensembled learning of Bag, Adaboost, and RUSBoost methods raises the accuracy to 73.8% and 93% AUC. To conclude. It can be seen that the presented CNN method has higher accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer’s severity. Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s patients from normal people is simpler than finding the severity of the disease. This is because of the close similarity between each class image. Therefore, the traditional machine learning methods with many feature extraction methods could not reach higher accuracy. However, the presented CNN solved this problem with 95.3% and 100% testing and training accuracy.',\n",
       "              'Conclusion': 'The training procedure achieved 100% accuracy for the categorization of input images based on the findings of the proposed CNN technique. Nevertheless, out of 300 mild images in the test samples, 288 (96.0%) were properly diagnosed. As a result, CNN’s sensitivity for detecting mild AD is 96%. The proposed CNN technique correctly diagnosed mild AD with 100 sensitivity. Furthermore, normal images are identified in 95.3% of cases. Consequently, the network’s precision for mild, moderate, normal, and very mild class diagnosis is 93.2%, 100%, 92.6%, and 95.7%, respectively. The accuracy of our provided CNN architecture was 95.3%. According to the findings, the accuracy and AUC value for the provided CNN techniques were greater than other ML classifiers. Furthermore, the KNN technique was ranked second in classification accuracy, with 74.5% accuracy and 92% AUC. Besides, combining the Bag, Adaboost, and RUSBoost algorithms improved accuracy to 73.8% and 93% AUC, respectively. To sum it up, the proposed CNN technique was more accurate in diagnosing Alzheimer’s severity.',\n",

As in Figure 8, after reducing the dimensionality of the input vector for classification, the Boxplots significantly compressed compared to that of the averaged missing data, which depicts less variance (i.e., higher stability) in the classification.

AML is most often observed in adults over the age of 35, accounting for 1% of all cancer types. In 2023, the number of new cases being reported was estimated to reach around 20,380 in total and the rate of mortality in the same year was 1.9%, or 11,310 cases, in the US. Purpose: This scoping study aims to extensively assess and explore the degree of cardiotoxicity in patients with AML that can be caused due to pharmaceutical treatments prescribed by hematologists. This is achieved by performing extensive searches of different scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Results: A variety of options are available that are summarized in tables included herein, with each having their advantages and risks of adverse effects, among these being cardiotoxicity. Important medications found to play a significant role include gemtuzumab ozogamicin, venetoclax, and vyxeos. Conclusions: It is understandable that being familiar with all the treatment options available and every potential adverse effect is impossible. However, hematologists and, in general, physicians must try to be updated with the most recent information released to improve the quality of life of their patients and minimize the risk of additional complications.',\n",
