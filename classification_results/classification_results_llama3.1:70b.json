            "Abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) concentration has reproducibly been shown to reflect neurodegeneration in brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). NfL concentration in blood correlates with the corresponding CSF levels, but few studies have directly compared the reliability of these 2 markers in sporadic AD. Herein, we measured plasma and CSF concentrations of NfL in 478 cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects, 227 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 113 patients with AD dementia. We found that the concentration of NfL in CSF, but not in plasma, was increased in response to Aβ pathology in CU subjects. Both CSF and plasma NfL concentrations were increased in patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. Furthermore, only NfL in CSF was associated with reduced white matter microstructure in CU subjects. Finally, in a transgenic mouse model of AD, CSF NfL increased before serum NfL in response to the development of Aβ pathology. In conclusion, NfL in CSF may be a more reliable biomarker of neurodegeneration than NfL in blood in preclinical sporadic AD.\nHighlights\nCSF NfL is increased and associated with amyloid pathology in preclinical AD.\nPlasma NfL is increased in symptomatic AD.\nCSF NfL is associated with reduced white matter microstructure in preclinical AD.\nPlasma NfL is associated with reduced white matter microstructure in symptomatic AD.\nIn 5xFAD mice, NfL in CSF is increased at an earlier time point than in serum.",
            "Method": "Materials and methods\nBioFINDER study population\nThe study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Lund, Sweden, and the participants or their relatives gave written informed consent.\nThe study population originated from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFINDER study and consisted of 298 cognitively healthy elderly participants, 407 patients with mild cognitive symptoms, and 113 patients with AD dementia from which baseline CSF and plasma NFL samples were available.\nCognitively healthy elderly participants were recruited from the longitudinal population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study between 2010 and 2014 according to the following inclusion criteria: ≥60 years of age, absence of cognitive symptoms as assessed by a physician, Mini-Mental State Examination score of 28–30 at screening visit, not fulfilling the criteria for MCI or any dementia, and fluency in Swedish. Exclusion criteria were significant neurological or psychiatric illness, significant alcohol or substance abuse, and refusing lumbar puncture or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nPatients with mild cognitive symptoms were consecutively enrolled from the Memory Clinic at Skåne University Hospital and Ängelholm Hospital in Sweden between 2010 and 2014. Included individuals had an age between 60 and 80 years, were referred to any of the 2 memory clinics due to cognitive symptoms, had an Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24–30 at baseline visit, did not fulfill the criteria for any dementia, and were fluent in Swedish. The exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment that with certainty could be explained by another condition or disease, significant alcohol or substance abuse, and refusing lumbar puncture or neuropsychological assessment. Following neuropsychological assessment including a test battery evaluating verbal ability, episodic memory function, visuospatial construction ability, and attention and executive functions, 180 patients were classified as subjective cognitive decline and 227 patients were classified as MCI. In accordance with the guidelines from the US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association, cognitively healthy elderly participants and patients with subjective cognitive decline were included in the CU group.\nPatients with AD dementia were included after thorough clinical assessment at the Memory Clinic at Skåne University Hospital in Sweden. All study participants met the criteria for probable AD dementia as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association. Individuals with significant alcohol or substance abuse were excluded.\nStudy participants who were CU or diagnosed with MCI were categorized into groups with normal (A−) or pathologic (A+) CSF Aβ using the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio with the cutoff <0.091. This cutoff was established using Gaussian mixture modeling. In addition, these individuals were further categorized based on normal (N−) and abnormal (N+) cortical thickness in AD-susceptible temporal regions as determined by MRI (see Section 2.3 below) with the cutoff <2.25. As cortical thickness was not bimodally distributed, Gaussian mixture modeling for cutoff determination could not be applied. Instead, the cutoff was defined as mean −1.5 standard deviation of A− CU cases, which has been commonly used in other studies. Participants with AD dementia were all A+, however, no information on cortical thickness was available for this group.\nCSF and blood collection in the BioFINDER study population\nCollection of lumbar CSF and blood samples from each study participant was performed on the same day, where blood was obtained within 15 minutes of CSF sampling. Lumbar CSF samples were collected according to a standardized protocol, centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000×g at 4 °C, and aliquoted into polypropylene tubes. Blood was drawn into EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000×g at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, plasma was collected and aliquoted into polypropylene tubes. The obtained CSF and plasma samples were stored at −80 °C until biochemically analyzed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMRI was completed in 478 CU subjects and 227 MCI patients, and the average time interval between MRI acquisition and fluid collection was 17 days. High-resolution T1-weighted MP-RAGE (TR = 1950 ms, TE = 3.4 ms, in-plane resolution = 1 × 1 mm2, slice thickness = 1.2 mm, 176 slices) and transversal T2-weighted FLAIR (TR = 9000 ms, TE = 89 ms, TI = 2500 ms, voxel size 0.7 × 0.7 × 4 mm3, distance factor 25%, 27 slices) imaging was performed on a 3T MR scanner (Siemens Tim Trio 3T; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany).\nCortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed with the FreeSurfer image analysis pipeline v5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Briefly, the T1-weighted images underwent correction for intensity homogeneity, removal of non-brain tissue, and segmentation into gray matter and white matter with intensity gradient and connectivity among voxels. Cortical modeling allowed parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units with respect to gyral and sulcal structure. Cortical thickness was measured as the distance from the gray/white matter boundary to the corresponding pial surface. Reconstructed data sets were visually inspected for accuracy, and segmentation errors were corrected. To determine AD-related brain atrophy we used the average cortical thickness in a predefined temporal lobe meta-region (composed of entorhinal, inferior temporal, middle temporal, and fusiform cortex).\nGlobal white matter lesion volume was determined by the use of an automated segmentation method, using the lesion prediction algorithm in the LST toolbox implemented in SPM8.\nFor diffusion MRI, a single-shot EPI sequence was used to obtain 66 contiguous axial slices with a spatial resolution of 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 (TR/TE = 86/8200 ms). The diffusion encoding was performed in 64 directions with b = 1000 s/mm2, and one additional volume was obtained for b = 0 s/mm2. To correct for motion and eddy-current induced distortions, all data were registered to the b = 0 s/mm2 volume using an affine transform implemented in Elastix. DTI analysis was performed using linear least squares with heteroscedasticity correction with software developed in-house in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). Parameter maps for mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated from the diffusion tensor.\nThe DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) (v 1.03) from the FMRIB Software Library. In this process, FA volumes were first masked with the FSL Brain Extraction Tool and then non-linearly registered to the 1 mm3 FMRIB58 FA template in MNI152 standard space, using FLIRT and FNIRT. The resulting subject-specific non-linear transform was then applied to the MD map. The maps in template space were then skeletonized by computing of the projection of the FA map onto the FMRIB58 template skeleton. Statistical processing was performed using a significance threshold of 0.05 in Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement and FSL Randomize (v 2.9), with 7500 permutations for generation of the null distribution. When generating the p-maps, multiple comparison-correction was accounted for by controlling the family-wise error rate. Hypothesis tests were performed using the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient for CSF NfL, or for plasma NfL, was zero, using age and sex as additional covariates. The tests were performed separately for CSF NfL and for plasma NfL for each of the 3 groups comprising all subjects, those in the CU group, or those in the MCI group. Due to incomplete data or failure of normalization, 11 CU subjects and 5 MCI subjects were excluded from the TBSS analysis.\n18F-flutemetamol PET imaging\n18F-flutemetomol PET scans for visualization of cerebral Aβ depositions were completed for 382 individuals, including 244 CU subjects and 138 MCI patients. Production of 18F-flutemetamol was performed at the radiopharmaceutical production site in Risø, Denmark, using a FASTlab synthesizer module (GE Healthcare, Cleveland, OH). PET/CT scans of the brain were obtained from 2 different sites using the same type of scanner (Germini; Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands). 18F-flutemetamol summation images for the period 90–110 minutes post injection a single dose of 18F-flutemetamol was analyzed using the NeuroMarQ software (GE Healthcare). A volume of interest (VOI) template was applied to define a global neocortical composite region, encompassing prefrontal, parietal, temporal lateral, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus VOIs. The standardized uptake value ratio was defined as the uptake in a VOI normalized to a composite reference region (whole cerebellum, the pons/brainstem, and eroded cortical white matter).\nAnimals\nTwo- to 12-month-old male and female heterozygous 5×FAD tg mice (n = 40), originally obtained from Jackson Laboratory, and age-matched non-tg littermates (n = 41) were used for the experiments. Animals were housed in groups of 2–6 mice per cage under a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Under the control of the mouse Thy1 promotor element, 5×FAD mice overexpress human APP(695) with the K670N/M671L (Swedish), 1716V (Florida), and V7171 (London) mutations together with human PS1 harboring the M146L and L286V mutations. Intraneuronal Aβ appears at 1.5 months in the deep cortical layers and subiculum, and extracellular amyloid plaques start to accumulate in the same regions around 2 months of age, spreading to other brain areas as the animal ages. In addition, a reduction in pre- and postsynaptic markers as well as neuronal loss has been reported in 9-month-old mice.\nThe experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Swedish animal research regulations and were approved by the committee of animal research at Lund University (ethical permit number: 7482/2017).\nCSF, blood, and brain tissue collection in mice\nCSF was collected from cisterna magna in accordance with a method previously described. All sample collection was performed between 9 AM and 13 PM. Under isoflurane anesthesia, mice were placed on a stereotaxic instrument and an incision of the skin inferior to the occiput was made. Using a dissecting microscope, the underlying neck muscles were then separated to expose the dura mater of the cisterna magna. A glass capillary tube with a tapered tip was used to penetrate the dura mater and collect CSF. Samples were immediately transferred to protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C until analysis.\nFollowing CSF sampling, blood was collected from the left heart ventricle using a 23G needle and immediately transferred to protein LoBind Tubes (Eppendorf). The blood samples were allowed to clot for 2 hours at room temperature before they were centrifuged at 2000×g for 20 minutes. Serum was then collected, aliquoted into protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf), and stored at −80 °C until analysis.\nFor brain tissue collections, mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). The brain was removed and the left hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4, for 48 hours at 4 °C and then immersed in 30% sucrose solution for 48 hours at 4 °C. Brains were serially cut into 30 μm sagittal sections using a sliding microtome (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected in antifreeze solution (30% sucrose and 30% ethylene glycol in PB) for storage at −20 °C.\nThioflavin S staining and analysis of mouse brain sections\nFree-floating sagittal brain sections (30 μm) were washed 3 × 10 minutes in Tris-buffered saline and then stained with 0.01% Thioflavin S (ThioS) in 50% ethanol for 10 minutes. Sections were washed 2 × 1 minute in 50% ethanol, 3 × 1 minute in ddH2O, and finally 10 minutes in Tris-buffered saline. The stained specimens were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped with SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Images of cortex and subiculum from 3 sections per animal were captured using a 10× objective lens on an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 LT+ digital COMOS camera. The area (%) covered by ThioS-positive amyloid plaques in the regions of interest was quantified using the Fiji software by applying an automated threshold that was maintained for all images analyzed.\nBiochemical analysis of CSF and blood from the BioFINDER study population and mice\nCSF NfL concentration in the BioFINDER study population was measured using a sensitive sandwich ELISA method (NF-light ELISA kit; UmanDiagnostics AB, Umeå, Sweden). Intra-assay coefficient of variance (CV) ranged between 7% and 10% and inter-assay CV was 13%. An in-house Simoa NfL assay, in which the monoclonal antibodies and calibrators from the NF-light ELISA kit (UmanDiagnostics AB) were transferred onto the Simoa platform using a homebrew kit (Quanterix, Lexington, MA), was used to measure plasma NfL concentration in the BioFINDER study population, as well as CSF and serum NfL concentrations in mice. The core domain of NfL, against which the antibodies are directed, is fully conserved between humans and mice. For measurement of plasma samples from the BioFINDER study population, the intra-assay CV was 5.5% and the inter-assay CV was 8.2% for the low-concentration quality control sample (11.1 pg/mL). For the high-concentration quality control sample (107.0 pg/mL), the corresponding CVs were 9.3% and 9.4%, respectively. Intra-assay CV for measurement of mouse CSF samples ranged between 2.9% and 11.1%, and intra- and inter-assay CV for measurement of mouse serum samples ranged between 3.2% and 8.7% and 6.5% and 13.8%, respectively. The concentration of Aβ40, Aβ42, and phosphorylated tau in CSF in the BioFINDER study population was measured by Euroimmun immunoassay. All measurements were performed in one round of experiments using one batch of reagents by board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical and genotype information.\nStatistical analysis\nFor the BioFINDER study population, demographic factors and clinical characteristics were compared between different diagnostic groups using the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the χ2 test for categorical variables. Group comparisons of CSF and plasma biomarkers were performed on log-transformed data using univariate general linear models adjusted for the confounding effects of age and sex. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. Spearman’s rank-ordered correlation coefficient and linear regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to examine associations between 2 continuous variables. The diagnostic accuracy of NfL in CSF and plasma was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Associations between NfL concentrations and 18F-flutemetamol standardized uptake value ratio were analyzed voxel-wise using SPM12 multilinear regression models, including age, sex, and the time interval between fluid collection and 18F-flutemetamol PET acquisition as covariates. Parametric maps were adjusted for multiple comparisons using family wise error correction.\nNonparametric statistical methods were used for analysis of data derived from animal experiments due to the relatively small sample size. Three extreme outliers with CSF or plasma NfL concentrations above 3 interquartile ranges of the third quartile were excluded from the analysis. The Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test was performed to study if CSF and serum NfL concentrations increased with age in 5×FAD mice and non-tg littermates. This test was also used to study if amyloid plaque load in cortex and subiculum of 5×FAD mice increased with age. If a statistically significant trend was found, post hoc analysis for group comparisons between the youngest group an all other groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare the concentrations of NfL in CSF and serum between 5×FAD mice and age-matched non-tg littermates. Correlation analysis was done using Spearman’s rank-ordered correlation coefficient. For comparisons between correlation coefficients, Meng’s Z-test for correlated correlations was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and corresponding graphs were produced in GraphPad Prism 8."

        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "Abstract\nPeople with dementia have an increase in brain inflammation, caused in part by innate and adaptive immune cells. However, it remains unknown whether dementia-associated diseases alter neuro-immune reflex arcs to impact the systemic immune system. We examined peripheral immune cells from a community-based cohort of older adults to test if systemic inflammatory cytokine signatures associated with early stages of cognitive impairment. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with monocyte or T-cell-targeted stimuli, and multiplex assays quantitated cytokines in the conditioned media. Following T-cell-targeted stimulation, cells from women with cognitive impairment produced lower amounts of TH17 cytokines compared with cells from cognitively healthy women, while myeloid-targeted stimuli elicited similar amounts of cytokines from cells of both groups. This TH17 signature correlated with the proportion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light concentrations. These results suggest that decreases in TH17 cytokines could be an early systemic change in women at risk for developing dementia. Amelioration of TH17s cytokines in early cognitive impairment could, in part, explain the compromised ability of older adults to respond to vaccines or defend against infection.\nBachstetter et al. found diminished TH17 cytokines produced by activated T cells from women with early cognitive decline, indicating a dementia-linked systemic immunological shift associated with the proportion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light concentrations.\nGraphical Abstract",
            "Method": "Materials and methods\nHuman subjects\nStudy participants were selected from a larger University of Kentucky Alzheimer Disease Research Center (UK-ADRC) community-based cohort study of ageing and dementia. Informed consent was obtained following University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. As previously described, the UK-ADRC study recruits older adult participants from the central Kentucky region of the USA, and includes ∼500 active participants that have annual follow-up visits. These visits include physical examination, neurological examination, medical history, and cognitive testing, among other measures. Clinical evaluations and cognitive testing were completed as previously described and followed the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center uniform data set used by Alzheimer’s disease centres. From the UK-ADRC cohort, we assayed peripheral blood from n = 44 cognitively healthy [Clinical Dementia Rating score (CDR) = 0], and n = 40 cognitively impaired (CDR = 0.5–1) individuals, with groups statistically similar for gender, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, or obesity), and age as indicated by their previous year study visit data. Exclusion criteria included Type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and current cancers. Blood samples were collected from August 2020 until June 2021. The study coordinator (B.J.M.) provided the de-identified samples to the experimentalists (A.D.B., J.L., and B.S.N.), who were blinded to the participant group identity until all the data had been generated.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation\nFive to 10 mL of peripheral blood was collected into acid/citrate/dextrose-containing tubes by venous puncture. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified by density centrifugation in Ficoll histopaque 1077 using SepMate PBMC isolation tube (StemCell Technologies, Cat#: 85415) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were then washed in buffer [0.1 BSA, 2 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 1× PBS]. Residual red blood cells were removed using red blood cells lysis buffer (eBioScience, Cat#: 00-4300-54), and the resulting PBMCs were aliquoted at a density of 1 × 106/mL, in freezing media containing 90% heat-inactivated FBS, plus 10% DMSO. The cells were then frozen at −80°C in a Mr Frosty apparatus (Nalgene) for 24 h, before storing the cells in liquid N2, until use.\nCell culture\nAfter thawing rapidly in a 37°C water bath, the PBMCs were plated at a density of 106 cells/mL/well in a 12-well plate (VWR, Cat#: 10062-894), in glucose-free RPMI media, containing L-glutamine and 25 mM hepes (Gibco, Cat#: 11879020) supplemented with 10% FBS heat-inactivated (Gibco, Cat#: 10438026), 1% pen/strep (Gibco, Cat#: 15140122), and 1% sodium pyruvate (Corning, Cat#: 25-000-CI). The cells were stimulated in multiple batches, and each batch included a random sampling of approximately six participants. The PBMCs were stimulated with Escherichia coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (25 ng/mL, Millipore Sigma; 20 h) or αCD3/αCD28 Dynabeads (1 bead/cell; Gibco, Cat#: 11131D; 40 h) in a CO2 incubator at 37°C prior to conditioned media collection. The unstimulated cells were incubated 40 h prior to conditioned media collection. The conditioned media was aliquoted and stored at −80°C for cytokine assays. The 20 and 40 h post-stimulation timepoints were determined based on prior studies.\nMultiplex measurement of cytokine concentrations from stimulated PBMCs\nSupernatant samples were thawed then centrifuged for 10 min at 1200 rpm to remove debris before being added to a 384-well plate for analysis by bioplex using the Milliplex human TH17 25-plex kit (Millipore) or 96-well Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) proinflammatory or TH17 multiplex kit, following the manufacturer’s protocols (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Samples were diluted in an assay buffer to ensure that the cytokines were in the linear range of the standard curve. The unstimulated cells were run undiluted. The MSD assay was used for cytokines that outside the linear range for the Milliplex kits.\nPlasma biomarker analysis\nPlasma collected from the same blood draw providing PBMCs was analysed on the Quanterix Simoa HD-X as previously described or on the MSD Quickplex SQ 120 using the V-Plex TH17 panel 1 (MSD, Cat#: K15085D), following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nFlow cytometry\nPBMCs were unthawed and washed with warm RPMI then washed with PBS. Cells were then stained with live/dead marker Ghost Dye-Alexa Fluor 700 (Tonbo Biosciences) for 30 min at 4°C according to the manufacturer’s instructions, then washed with FACS buffer. Human FcR blocking reagent, human (Miltenyi Biotec) was used to block unwanted binding of antibodies to FC receptors for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were then stained for immune cell markers CD3-FITC (BD Biosciences, Cat#: 555332), CD8-PE (BD Biosciences, Cat#: 555635), CD4-APC (BD Biosciences, Cat#: 555349) for 30 min at 4°C. Stained cells were fixed with cytofix (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4°C, then washed and suspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide). BD Symphony A3 was used to acquire cell populations. Analysis was conducted with Flow v10.8 software. Fluorescence-minus one controls were used to identify cell populations, and each experiment had single-stained and no-stain controls.\nStatistics\nCharacteristics of participants were assessed with ANOVA, or χ2 tests. All cytokine and fluid biomarker data were log2 transformed. For categorical comparisons, an unadjusted t-test or one-way ANOVA were used for the combined data, or for data stratified by sex. Multiple linear regression models were used to adjust mean responses for covariates as listed in the figure and Supplemental tables. False discovery rate (FDR) values for multiple comparisons were applied based on the Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment. Pairwise effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d. The effect size for linear regressions was calculated as R2 or Ω2. Z-scores were created using the sample means and standard deviations of the log2 transformed data. For the box-and-whiskers plots, the box shows the median and 25th and 75th percentile, and the whiskers show the minimum and maximum values. All data analysis was completed in JMP Pro v16 between January 2022 and September 2022. Data visualizations were created in JMP Pro v16 or GraphPad Prism v9.4."

        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "Background\nAging and sex are major risk factors for developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Compared to men, women experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease. Similarly, male 3xTg-AD mice, developed to model Alzheimer’s disease, no longer consistently exhibit standard Alzheimer’s neuropathology yet experience higher rates of mortality - providing a unique opportunity to further elucidate this dichotomy. We hypothesized that sex differences in the biological aging process yield distinct pathological and molecular Alzheimer’s disease signatures in males and females, which could be harnessed for therapeutic and biomarker development.\nMethods\nWe aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 control mice across their respective lifespans (n = 3–8 mice per sex, strain, and age group) and longitudinally assessed neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, markers of hepatic inflammation, splenic mass and morphology, as well as plasma cytokine levels. We conducted RNA sequencing analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and B6129 samples and across ages in each sex. We also examined DEGs between clinical Alzheimer’s and control parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank study in each sex.\nResults\n3xTg-AD females significantly outlived 3xTg-AD males and exhibited progressive Alzheimer’s neuropathology, while 3xTg-AD males demonstrated progressive hepatic inflammation, splenomegaly, circulating inflammatory proteins, and minimal Alzheimer’s neuropathological hallmarks. Instead, 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females. Our clinical investigations revealed that individuals with Alzheimer’s disease develop similar sex-specific alterations in neuronal and immune function. In diseased males of both species, we observed greater upregulation of complement-related gene expression, and lipopolysaccharide was predicted as the top upstream regulator of DEGs.\nConclusions\nOur data demonstrate that chronic inflammation and complement activation are associated with increased mortality, indicating that age-related changes in immune response contribute to sex differences in Alzheimer’s disease trajectories. We provide evidence that aging and transgene-driven disease progression trigger a widespread inflammatory response in 3xTg-AD males, which mimics the impact of lipopolysaccharide stimulation despite the absence of infection.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13195-024-01492-x.",
            "Method": "Methods\nAnimals\nColony Maintenance: The 3xTg-AD mice utilized were previously described and were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (B6;129-Tg(APPSwe,tauP301L)1Lfa Psen1tm1Mpm/Mmjax; MMRRC Strain #034830-JAX). Homozygous expression for the mutations in the PSEN1, APP, and MAPT genes were confirmed with TaqMan Real-Time PCR assays and the colony was maintained using 3xTg-AD mice breeding pairs. Wildtype controls were bred in-house - C57BL/6J (B6; Strain #000664) females and 129S1/SvImJ males (129S; Strain #002448) were crossed to produce B6129SF1/J mice. Mice were housed 3–5 per cage, kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. All animal procedures were approved by Dartmouth College’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Blood samples obtained from sentinel mice underwent quarterly and yearly serology testing with the Multiplexed Fluorometric ImmunoAssay at Charles River Research Animal Diagnostic Services to confirm the absence of pathogens (see Supplementary Table 1, Additional file 1 for list of tested agents).\nHistology\nAntibodies: We obtained beta-amyloid recombinant rabbit monoclonal antibody (H31L21, catalog #700254), phospho-tau (Ser202, Thr205) mouse monoclonal antibody (AT8, catalog #MN1020), and tau mouse monoclonal antibody (HT7, catalog #MN1000) from Thermo Fisher Scientific. We obtained CD45 rabbit monoclonal antibody (D3F8Q, catalog #70257) and F4/80 XP rabbit monoclonal antibody (D2S9R, catalog #70076 from Cell Signaling Technology. Staining: Hemibrains, spleen, and liver tissue samples were collected from animals euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Transcardiac perfusion with PBS and heparin was subsequently performed. Samples were fixed in formalin for 24 h and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Tissues were stored in hinged biopsy cassettes and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry slides were cut at 4um and air dried at room temperature before baking at 60ºC for 30 min. Automated protocol performed on the Leica Bond Rx included paraffin dewax, antigen retrieval and staining. Heat-induced epitope retrieval using Bond Epitope Retrieval 2, pH9 (Leica Biosystems AR9961) was incubated at 100ºC for 30 min. Primary antibody was applied and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Primary antibody binding was detected and visualized using the Leica Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica Biosystems DS9800) with DAB chromogen and hematoxylin counterstain. Quantification: Slides were imaged with a 40 × slide scanner and converted to digital files. QuPath software was utilized to quantify antibody staining. For Aβ staining, plaques were outlined with the QuPath wand tool, and plaque surface areas were measured and summated across the sagittal brain section. Total brain surface area, excluding the olfactory bulb and cerebellum due to variation in tissue integrity across samples, was measured. Total plaque surface area out of total brain surface area produced normalized Aβ plaque surface area values for each sample. For all other staining, QuPath automated positive cell detection analyzed the designated region of interest, generating a number of positive detections per mm2 of annotation area. For phospho-tau staining, the subiculum and CA1 comprised the annotated region. For total tau staining, the hippocampal formation and its immediate surroundings comprised the annotated region. For CD45 and F4/80 staining, a representative portion of the liver comprised the annotated region, given the lack of anatomical differentiation. While regions of interest ranged across markers, only a single annotated region from a single brain section was quantified for each stain per individual mouse. For each batch of samples, negative controls that underwent all histology protocol steps except for primary antibody application were quantified using the same methods, and resulting values were subtracted from stained samples to normalize for background staining and technical variation.\nCytokine profiling\nPlasma collection: Blood was collected retro-orbitally in living animals or through the inferior vena cava immediately following euthanasia via carbon dioxide inhalation with confirmatory cervical dislocation. This euthanasia method limited stress induced cytokine expression at the end of life and minimized differences between terminal and retro-orbital (RO) bleeds. Of the 80 total plasma samples analyzed, 25 (10 terminally bled, 15 retro-orbitally bled) came from 3xTg-AD females, 15 (7 terminal, 8 RO) came from 3xTg-AD males, 20 (9 terminal, 11 RO) came from WT females, and 20 (10 terminal, 10 RO) came from WT males. Overall, 71 individual mice were represented, with repeated blood draws only included from 9 mice. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane during retro-orbital bleeds. Blood samples were transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with edetic acid (EDTA) for anti-coagulation (4uL EDTA/ ~ 200 uL blood). Tubes were immediately placed on ice and then centrifuged at 4ºC for 10 min at 1000 rcf. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 4ºC for 3 min at 14,000 rpm. Plasma was transferred to a new tube and stored at -80ºC until use. Assay: Inflammatory proteins were measured using the MILLIPLEX Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel – Premixed 32 Plex – Immunology Multiplex Assay (EMD Millipore. Corporation, Billerica, MA). Calibration curves from recombinant cytokine standards were prepared with threefold dilution steps in the same matrix as the samples. High and low spikes (supernatants from stimulated PBMCs and dendritic cells) were included to determine cytokine recovery. Standards and spikes were measured in triplicate, samples were measured once, and blank values were subtracted from all readings. All assays were carried out directly in a 96-well filtration plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at room temperature and protected from light. Briefly, wells were pre-wet with 100 uL PBS containing 1% BSA, then beads together with a standard, sample, spikes, or blank were added in a final volume of 100 uL and incubated together at room temperature for 30 min with continuous shaking. Beads were washed three times with 100 uL PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. A cocktail of biotinylated antibodies (50 uL/well) was added to beads for a further 30-min incubation with continuous shaking. Beads were washed three times, then streptavidin-PE was added for 10 min. Beads were again washed three times and resuspended in 125 uL of PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. The fluorescence intensity of the beads was measured using the Bio-Plex array reader. Bio-Plex Manager software with five-parametric-curve fitting was used for data analysis. Intra-assay precision quality controls indicated 2.9% coefficient of variation. Data points considered out of range below (OOR <) were substituted with a 0, the minimum detectable value.\nRNA isolation and sequencing\nIsolation: Brain tissue was dissected from animals euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation with confirmatory cervical dislocation, followed by perfusion with PBS and heparin. Samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC. Samples were later placed in a deep-well 96-well plate with stainless steel RNase-free homogenization beads and QIAzol lysis buffer. Plates were inserted into the SPEX SamplePrep 1600 MiniG tissue homogenizer and run at maximum speed for 5 min. Following homogenization, the tissue solution was added to QIAzol lysis buffer and stored at -80ºC. Lysed tissue solution was subsequently added to the QIAGEN miRNeasy Micro Kit for purification of total RNA. Sequencing: RNA for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was quantified by qubit, and integrity was measured on a fragment analyzer (Agilent). 200 ng RNA was hybridized to FastSelect probes (QIAGEN) for ribodepletion, followed by library preparation using the Kapa RNA HyperPrep kit (Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were pooled for sequencing on a NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina) targeting 30 M, paired-end 50 bp reads per sample. A fastqc report was generated for visual inspection of the data. Raw data were pre-processed by removing adapter sequences using Cutadapt (v3.4), aligning to the mm10 reference genome using HISAT2 (v2.1.0) and quantifying read counts using the Featurecounts function (v2.0.1) from the subreads package to generate a gene expression matrix for downstream processing. Reads mapping to rRNAs were not used for analysis and were filtered from the dataset. Pseudogenes and genes without canonical names were filtered from the matrix prior to further analysis.\nRNA-Seq analysis\nBatch Adjustment: To adjust for sequencing batch effects within our total sample population, ComBat-seq was applied as previously described. Differential Expression Analysis: DESeq2 was utilized as previously described to identify differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and WT controls at various ages using R (v4.3.0) and RStudio (v2023.12.0 + 369). A negative binomial generalized linear model was applied. Differential expression p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Clinical data access: Clinical data were obtained from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study through the AD Knowledge Portal. Parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from females with AD (n = 103), female controls (n = 39), males with AD (n = 52), and male controls (n = 32) were sequenced and analyzed. Diagnoses of AD or control (CT) were determined based on the clinical dementia rating scale, Mini Mental State Exam, and Braak staging. Age: In the female AD sample group, 1% were in their sixties, 8% were in their seventies, 34% were in their eighties, and 57% were in their nineties or older. In the female control group, 5% were in their sixties, 20% were in their seventies, 54% were in their eighties, and 20% were in their nineties or older. In the male AD sample group, 12% were in their sixties, 38% were in their seventies, 38% were in their eighties, and 12% were in their nineties or older. In the male control group, 25% were in their sixties, 44% were in their seventies, 13% were in their eighties, and 19% were in their nineties or older. Race: The majority of individuals identified as white (91% in AD females, 80% in CT females, 88% in AD males, and 66% in CT males). The remainder were Hispanic or Black, in addition to one Asian control male. APOE genotype: The majority of individuals possessed no APOE4 alleles (58% in AD females, 77% in CT females, 63% in AD males, and 81% in CT males), followed by APOE4 heterozygotes (37% in AD females, 23% in CT females, 23% in AD males, and 19% in CT males), and APOE4 homozygotes (5% in AD females, 0% in CT females, 13% in AD males, and 0% in CT males). Pathway Analysis: Statistically significant, differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05) were categorized into canonical pathways using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Core Analysis and Enrichr. Predicted upstream regulators of DEGs were identified using IPA Upstream Analysis. Over-Representation Analysis: Statistically significant, differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05) underwent Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) to determine if specific gene ontology biological processes were likely present more than by chance. WebGestalt was utilized to perform ORA with the Illumina mouseref 8 reference set. Affinity propagation was applied for redundancy reduction of enrichment categories. Differential expression p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini-Hochberg method.\nStatistical analysis\nSplenic weight, IHC markers, and cytokine concentrations were analyzed using a linear regression model with R (v4.3.0) and RStudio (v2023.12.0 + 369). We tested the overall effects of relevant independent variables (i.e. sex, strain, age) across samples in each analysis. Independent variables were only incorporated into a model if they were matched across all conditions (i.e. age-matched samples of each condition in splenic weight analyses). We also performed secondary linear regression analyses in which samples were organized into experimental groups (i.e. 6-month-old 3xTg-AD females). Experimental groups were then contrasted against respective control/reference groups (i.e. 6-month-old 3xTg-AD females vs. 6-month-old 3xTg-AD males). P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. R-squared values determined the effect size of each regression model. Effect sizes, f-statistics, and complete linear regression results can be found in Supplementary Table 3, Additional file 3. Animal survival probabilities were compared between sexes and strains using the likelihood ratio test, Wald test, and log-rank test for Kaplan-Meier analyses. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the association of sex and strain with mortality risk.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe RNA-seq dataset generated during the current study is deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO Series Accession Number GSE254970 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE254970).

        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMonoclonal antibodies that target amyloid-beta (Aβ) have the potential to slow cognitive and functional decline in persons with early Alzheimer’s disease. Gantenerumab is a subcutaneously administered, fully human, anti-Aβ IgG1 monoclonal antibody with highest affinity for aggregated Aβ that has been tested for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted two phase 3 trials (GRADUATE I and II) involving participants 50 to 90 years of age with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and evidence of amyloid plaques on positron-emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Participants were randomly assigned to receive gantenerumab or placebo every 2 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale−Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment) at week 116.\nRESULTS\nA total of 985 and 980 participants were enrolled in the GRADUATE I and II trials, respectively. The baseline CDR-SB score was 3.7 in the GRADUATE I trial and 3.6 in the GRADUATE II trial. The change from baseline in the CDR-SB score at week 116 was 3.35 with gantenerumab and 3.65 with placebo in the GRADUATE I trial (difference, −0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.66 to 0.05; P = 0.10) and was 2.82 with gantenerumab and 3.01 with placebo in the GRADUATE II trial (difference, −0.19; 95% CI, −0.55 to 0.17; P = 0.30). At week 116, the difference in the amyloid level on PET between the gantenerumab group and the placebo group was −66.44 and −56.46 centiloids in the GRADUATE I and II trials, respectively, and amyloid-negative status was attained in 28.0% and 26.8% of the participants receiving gantenerumab in the two trials. Across both trials, participants receiving gantenerumab had lower CSF levels of phosphorylated tau 181 and higher levels of Aβ42 than those receiving placebo; the accumulation of aggregated tau on PET was similar in the two groups. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema (ARIA-E) occurred in 24.9% of the participants receiving gantenerumab, and symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 5.0%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong persons with early Alzheimer’s disease, the use of gantenerumab led to a lower amyloid plaque burden than placebo at 116 weeks but was not associated with slower clinical decline. (Funded by F. Hoffmann−La Roche; GRADUATE I and II ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT03444870 and NCT03443973, respectively.)",
            "Method": "METHODS\nTRIAL DESIGN\nThe GRADUATE I and II trials were phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials. Participants were recruited from 288 sites in 30 countries (156 sites in 15 countries in the GRADUATE I trial; 152 sites in 18 countries in the GRADUATE II trial) on five continents. Recruitment methods differed across sites and included review of patient databases and local advertising. After screening, eligible participants entered a double-blind treatment period. Some participants were enrolled in substudies that involved longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation for amyloid, PET evaluation for amyloid, or PET evaluation for tau; these substudies were conducted to evaluate the effect of gantenerumab on brain amyloid and tau levels. CSF evaluation was conducted only at sites where lumbar puncture could be performed.\nAll the participants were evaluated for adverse events, concomitant medication use, and vital signs at every visit. Visits took place every 2 to 4 weeks (depending on dosing frequency), either at a trial site or at home (when applicable). Personnel who prepared and administered gantenerumab or placebo were not involved in any efficacy or safety assessments. All clinical assessments were completed by raters who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale was used by raters who had appropriate training and experience, were not involved in safety assessments, and did not receive any data regarding amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Efforts were made to keep the CDR rater consistent throughout the trial for each participant. Different raters were involved in the other clinical assessments. Long-term safety follow-up visits were conducted 14 and 50 weeks after the last dose of gantenerumab or placebo was administered. Additional details regarding the design of the trials and substudies are provided in the protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nTRIAL OVERSIGHT\nThe GRADUATE I and II trials were designed and funded by the sponsor, F. Hoffmann–La Roche. The sponsor provided the trial drug and placebo. Two authors employed by the sponsor analyzed the data in collaboration with academic authors. The first, second, and last authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript with professional medical writing assistance, which was funded by the sponsor. All the authors contributed to subsequent drafts. The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trials to the protocol. Confidentiality agreements were in place between the authors and the sponsor, and the sponsor could not interdict or delay the publication of results.\nThe trials were conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as well as the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted. The protocol and any subsequent amendments were approved by the relevant institutional review board or ethics committee and by regulatory authorities. All the trial participants provided written informed consent. An independent data and safety monitoring committee, which consisted of experts in Alzheimer’s disease and statistics, reviewed unblinded safety data during the trials.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nPersons 50 to 90 years of age were eligible for inclusion in the trials if they had mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease or had mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (conditions previously referred to as prodromal Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease, respectively), in accordance with National Institute on Aging−Alzheimer’s Association diagnostic criteria. Specifically, participants needed to have a CDR−Global Score (CDR-GS) of 0.5 or 1, indicating very mild or mild dementia, respectively. The CDR-GS is derived from an algorithm with six domains; possible scores are 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Participants also needed to have a score on the Mini−Mental State Examination (MMSE) of 22 or higher (range, 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater impairment); cognitive impairment as manifested by abnormal memory, with a Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) cueing index of 0.67 or lower (range, 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance) and an FCSRT free recall score of 27 or lower (range, 0 to 48, with higher values indicating better performance); and the presence of amyloid plaque on visual reading of PET or a ratio of phosphorylated tau 181 to Aβ42 of more than 0.024 on CSF testing.\nPersons were excluded from the trials if they were taking anticoagulants or GV-971 (an oligosaccharide intended to reduce inflammation in the brain by regulating the gut microbiota) or if they had clinically significant findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening that could cause cognitive impairment, such as more than five microhemorrhages, more than two lacunar infarcts, or a Fazekas score of 3, indicating that confluent areas of the brain are affected by white-matter hyperintensity. Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.\nParticipants needed to have amyloid-positive status on the basis of PET or CSF testing at screening. If amyloid was detected on PET, the participant was eligible for enrollment in the amyloid PET substudy. If amyloid was detected on CSF testing, the participant was eligible for enrollment in the amyloid CSF substudy. There were no restrictions on eligibility for enrollment in the tau PET substudy.\nRANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT\nParticipants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gantenerumab or placebo, administered at a trial site or at home by a nurse. Randomization was stratified according to clinical stage (mild cognitive impairment due to Alzh eimer’s disease vs. mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease); apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype (no ε4 allele vs. one or two ε4 alleles); use of medication for Alzheimer’s disease symptoms, such as donepezil or memantine (use vs. no use); geographic region (Western Europe and Australia vs. North America vs. other regions); and participation in the amyloid PET substudy or the tau PET substudy (participation vs. no participation).\nDuring the double-blind treatment period, the gantenerumab dose was increased over a period of 36 weeks to a target level of 510 mg every 2 weeks, regardless of APOE ε4 genotype. Participants received a minimum of three doses at each level: the dose was started at 120 mg every 4 weeks (for three doses) and was increased to 255 mg every 4 weeks (for three doses), then to 510 mg every 4 weeks (for three doses), and finally to 510 mg every 2 weeks. At weeks 12, 24, and 36, participants underwent MRI for confirmation of the safety of dose escalation, performed with the use of an algorithm for the management of ARIA, before the next dose level was administered (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix); MRI monitoring continued throughout the trial (weeks 48, 60, 76, 104, and 116). MRIs were assessed by independent neuroradiologists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The double-blind treatment period was initially planned to be 104 weeks and was extended to 116 weeks in response to delayed and missed visits due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. After completion of the 116-week double-blind treatment period, eligible participants could receive open-label gantenerumab, either under the GRADUATE protocol or after enrollment in the PostGRADUATE trial.\nEFFICACY\nThe primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the CDR−Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment) at week 116. Three outcomes were defined in the statistical analysis plan as confirmatory secondary outcomes: the change from baseline in the score on the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog13; range, 0 to 85, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment), in the total score on the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study−Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL; range, 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating greater functional impairment), and in the score on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ; range, 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater functional impairment) at week 116. Additional secondary and exploratory outcomes are listed in the protocol.\nSAFETY\nSafety outcomes included the incidence, nature, severity, and timing of adverse events, serious adverse events, and ARIA, including ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderosis (ARIA-H). Additional safety outcomes included injection-site reactions, findings on physical examination, vital signs, results of blood tests, findings on electrocardiography, the score on the Columbia−Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and the presence of antidrug antibodies. All safety assessments were completed by raters who were unaware of the trial-group assignments.\nBIOMARKERS\nExploratory biomarker outcomes included the change from baseline in plasma levels of phosphorylated tau 181 and Aβ42, as well as the change from baseline in the volume of the whole brain, ventricles, and hippocampi on volumetric MRI. Plasma and MRI biomarkers were assessed in all the participants. Additional biomarker outcomes included the change from baseline in CSF levels of total tau, phosphorylated tau 181, Aβ42, Aβ40, neurogranin, and neurofilament light. CSF biomarkers were assessed in the participants in whom amyloid had been detected on CSF testing at screening and a CSF sample had been obtained at week 116.\nIn the amyloid PET substudy, the main outcome was the change from baseline to week 116 in the amyloid level. The amyloid level was assessed on florbetaben or flutemetamol PET and was measured as a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), which is the ratio of the standardized uptake value in the composite region of interest to the value in the inferior cerebellar cortex; the SUVR results were converted to centiloids. In the tau PET substudy, the main outcome was the change from baseline to week 116 in the tau level. The tau level was assessed in medial temporal, lateral temporal, frontal, and parietal composite regions on PET with 18F-GTP1 (Genentech tau probe 1, an investigational radioligand for in vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates) and was measured as an SUVR. Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nWe calculated that a sample of approximately 1016 participants per trial group (in both trials combined) would provide the trials with 90% power to detect a change from baseline in the CDR-SB score in the gantenerumab group that was 30% lower than the change in the placebo group, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Assumptions for the power calculation, which were based on earlier studies such as the SCARLET ROAD trial and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00106899, NCT01231971, and NCT01078636), included the following: a mean change from baseline in the CDR-SB score at week 104 of 2.5 points with placebo, on the basis of expected disease progression and earlier studies; a common standard deviation across trial groups for the change from baseline in the CDR-SB score at week 104 of approximately 2.97; and a true effect of a 30% relative reduction in the deterioration of the CDR-SB score with gantenerumab. A decrease in sample size of up to 35% was also assumed. It was estimated that because of the Covid-19 pandemic, participants would miss a mean of 8 weeks of the double-blind treatment period (i.e., two to four visits during that period) over the course of the trials, which would reduce the power from 90% to 80%. The protocol was therefore amended to extend the double-blind treatment period to a total of 116 weeks to mitigate the effect of missed visits.\nThe efficacy analysis included participants who had received at least one dose of gantenerumab or placebo. Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed according to a fixed hierarchical testing procedure, in the order provided above, for control of the overall type I error at 5%. The primary outcome was the first outcome analyzed in the hierarchical analysis. If the between-group difference in the primary outcome was not significant, the difference for all subsequent outcomes was considered to be not significant. Control of the type I error was performed at the trial level, and each trial had a separate analysis.\nIn line with the estimand framework, primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed with conditional mean imputation followed by analysis of covariance, as implemented in the R package for reference-based mean imputation (R Project for Statistical Computing). In statistical models that used change from baseline as the dependent variable, there was no imputation of the baseline value; therefore, participants missing the baseline value did not contribute to the analysis. When data were missing for a participant after the occurrence of a prespecified intercurrent event that was deemed by an independent adjudication committee to be unrelated to the trial drug or condition, the data were imputed with the standard “missing at random” assumption; when data were missing for a participant after the occurrence of a prespecified intercurrent event that was deemed to be related to the trial drug or condition, the data were imputed on the basis of the trajectory in the placebo group, with the “copy increment from reference” assumption. Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were conducted, including a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with adjustment for the baseline CDR-SB score, stratification factors, and key prognostic factors (see the statistical analysis plan, available with the protocol). Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nThe safety analysis included participants who had received at least one dose of gantenerumab or placebo; those who had received at least one dose of gantenerumab were included in the gantenerumab group, regardless of the trial-group assignment. Amyloid PET, tau PET, and plasma biomarker outcomes were analyzed with MMRM. CSF biomarker outcomes were analyzed with analysis of covariance. For plasma and CSF biomarker outcomes, a logarithmic transformation was applied before model fitting."

            "Method": "METHODS\nStudy population\nThis study is ancillary to BALTAZAR, a multicenter (23 memory centers) prospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier #NCT01315639) including participants with MCI and AD at baseline from September 2010 to April 2015 and with an ongoing 3‐year follow‐up. All participants or their legal guardians gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the Paris Ethics Committee (CPP Ile de France IV Saint Louis Hospital). All participants were Caucasian community dwellers and had caregivers. Inclusion criteria for AD participants were age ≥45 years, probable AD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM IV‐TR), and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria and from mild to moderate stage (Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE] score ≥15). Inclusion criteria for MCI participants were age ≥70 years with MCI diagnostic criteria according to Petersen. Exclusion criteria were non‐AD dementia (ie, vascular dementia, Lewy body or Parkinson's disease dementia, and frontotemporal dementia); genetic forms of AD; major depression according to DSM IV‐TR or geriatric depression scale > 20/30; other diseases that could interfere with cognitive evaluation; diseases with short‐term survival; use of cholinesterase inhibitors or methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor partial antagonists before inclusion (for participants with MCI); and illiterateness or less than 4 years of education.\nAt baseline, all the participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological, and biological assessments, and participants without contraindications underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain examinations. Cognitive evaluations were performed by neuropsychologists after training programs to harmonize the evaluation. At inclusion, MCI and AD participants underwent a neuropsychological test battery that included global cognitive assessment with the MMSE (normal score 30/30), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (CDR sum of boxes: normal score 0/18). Functional disability was assessed using instrumental activities of daily living (IADL, normal score 14/14) (for the description of all tests performed in the cohort see Hanon et al.). MCI participants were then categorized as aMCI or naMCI according to the presence of memory impairment on the free and cued selective recall reminding test related to age, sex, and educational level. Conversion to dementia in the naMCI group was very low (2.5%) compared to the aMCI group (22.4%).\nHabitual caffeine consumption\nThis study enrolled 263 patients (see flowchart in Figure S1) in which habitual caffeine intake was assessed using an in‐house validated self‐survey, completed together by the patients and their caregivers. At inclusion, the daily intake of caffeine‐containing items (coffee, tea, chocolate, sodas) was reported. The daily caffeine intake at inclusion was then calculated as milligrams per day. Participants were dichotomized according to their median caffeine consumption (216 mg/day), defining “low caffeine consumption” (≤216 mg/day) and “high caffeine consumption” (>216 mg/day) groups.\nCSF and plasma biomarker measurements\nBlood and CSF samples were collected at the same time. Investigators involved in the biological analysis were blinded to other assessments. A standard protocol was established beforehand and used throughout the study. CSF samples (>4 mL) were centrifuged (1000 × g, +4 C, 10 min) less than 4 h after collection using the same 10‐mL polypropylene tube (Catalogue No. #62.610.201; Sarstedt, Germany), aliquoted into polypropylene protein low‐binding tubes (LoBind microtube‐ref 022431064; Eppendorf), and stored at −80°C. CSF tau, p‐tau181, Aβ40, and Aβ42 were measured in duplicate using the same aliquot in a single centralized laboratory (IRMB, Montpellier, France) using commercially available ELISA kits (Euroimmun Aβ1‐40 and Aβ1‐42, Innotest htau and Innotest p‐tau181). It is noteworthy that about half of patients did not accept lumbar puncture, which explains the missing data on CSF biomarkers.\nRegarding plasma, all centers used the same 10 mL collection tube with EDTA (BD Vacutainer K2E Catalogue No. 367,525, Becton Dickinson, Rungis, France). After centrifugation (2500 × g, 10 min), the supernatants were aliquoted into polypropylene protein low‐binding tubes (LoBind‐microtube, Ref #022431064; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and stored at −80°C. Plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptide assay was performed in a single centralized laboratory (Inserm UMRS1172, Lille) using the INNO‐BIA kit (Fujirebio Europe NV, formerly Innogenetics NV, Belgium), based on a multiplex xMAP technique with a LABScan‐200 system (Luminex BV). Plasma p‐tau181 was determined using a commercial Simoa plasma p‐tau181 Advantage V1 kit, and plasma neurofilament light (NfL) using a commercial Simoa NF‐light Advantage Kit (Quanterix, Billerica, MA, USA) in a single centralized laboratory (IRMB, Montpellier, France). Internal quality controls (IQCs) represented by serum pool aliquots were used to monitor the accuracy of Simoa. All samples were measured after a single thaw.\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT\n Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using traditional (eg, PubMed) sources, meeting abstracts, and presentations. While the impact of habitual caffeine consumption on age‐related cognitive decline has been addressed in longitudinal studies and meta‐analyses, its impact in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients remains ill defined, in particular regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.\n Interpretation: Our data support an association of lower caffeine consumption with a higher risk of being amnestic as well as with deleterious changes in CSF biomarkers of MCI and AD patients.\n Future directions: The article proposes a framework for future interventional clinical studies aimed at evaluating the effect of caffeine on clinical progression and biomarker changes during the course of AD and at better understanding the associated biological mechanisms.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables are reported as frequency (percentage). Continuous variables are reported as mean (standard deviation [SD]) in the case of normal distribution or median (interquartile range [IQR]) otherwise. Normality of distributions was assessed using histograms and the Shapiro–Wilk test.\nPatient characteristics and CSF biomarkers were compared between the three diagnostic groups (naMCI, aMCI, and AD) using chi‐squared test (or Fisher's exact test in the case of an expected value <5) for categorical variables and using analysis of variance or Kruskal–Wallis test for quantitative variables. CSF data were not imputed as the proportion of missing data was too important and not random. For MCI patients, association between biomarkers and conversion to AD were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The proportional hazards assumption and the log‐linearity assumption for quantitative variables were assessed by examining the scaled Schoenfeld residuals plots and the Martingale residual plots. Hazard ratios were estimated with their 95% confidence interval (CI).\nThe impact of low or high caffeine consumption on the diagnostic group was evaluated using a multinomial logistic regression model adjusted on predefined confounding factors (Apolipoprotein E [APOE ε4], age, sex, education level, and tobacco consumption). Odds ratios (ORs) were derived from models with their 95% CIs. The same analysis was performed by regrouping aMCI and DA groups using a logistic regression model adjusted on predefined confounding factors.\nThe impact of low or high caffeine consumption on biomarkers was evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted on predefined confounding factors and after applying a log transformation of the CSF biomarkers and plasma NfL levels. Mean difference was derived from models with their 95% CIs.\nAll statistical tests were done at the two‐tailed α‐level of 0.05 using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)."

        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "Abstract\nINTRODUCTION\nTau phosphorylated at threonine‐217 (pT217‐tau) is a novel fluid‐based biomarker that predicts onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms, but little is known about how pT217‐tau arises in the brain, as soluble pT217‐tau is dephosphorylated post mortem in humans.\nMETHODS\nWe used multilabel immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy to examine the subcellular localization of early‐stage pT217‐tau in entorhinal and prefrontal cortices of aged macaques with naturally occurring tau pathology and assayed pT217‐tau levels in plasma.\nRESULTS\npT217‐tau was aggregated on microtubules within dendrites exhibiting early signs of degeneration, including autophagic vacuoles. It was also seen trafficking between excitatory neurons within synapses on spines, where it was exposed to the extracellular space, and thus accessible to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/blood. Plasma pT217‐tau levels increased across the age span and thus can serve as a biomarker in macaques.\nDISCUSSION\nThese data help to explain why pT217‐tau predicts degeneration in AD and how it gains access to CSF and plasma to serve as a fluid biomarker.",
            "Method": "METHODS\nElectron microscopy\nAnimals and tissue processing\nThree “early” aged (18–24 years) and five “late” aged (26–31 years) rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used in this study and were maintained and euthanized in accordance with the guidelines of the US Department of Agriculture, the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and in accordance with the Weatherall report. As described previously, primates were deeply anesthetized prior to transcardial perfusion of 100 mM phosphate‐buffered saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde/0.05% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM phosphate‐buffered saline. After perfusion, a craniotomy was performed, and the entire brain was removed and blocked. The brains were sectioned coronally at 60 μm on a vibratome (Leica) across the entire rostrocaudal extent of the ERC and dlPFC (Walker's area 46). The sections were cryoprotected through increasing concentrations of sucrose solution (10%, 20%, and 30% each for overnight), cooled rapidly using liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Sections of ERC and dlPFC were processed for immunocytochemistry. To enable penetration of immunoreagents, all sections went through three freeze–thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Non‐specific reactivity was suppressed with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and antibody penetration was enhanced with 0.3% Triton X‐100 in 50 mM Tris‐buffered saline (TBS).\nHistology and immunoreagents\nPreviously characterized primary antibodies for pT217‐tau raised in rabbits were used, and complexed with species‐specific goat secondary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: (1) rabbit anti‐pT217‐tau at 1:200 (cat# AS‐54968, Anaspec). The immunogen used keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated with synthetic peptides corresponding to human tau at phosphorylated threonine 217; (2) rabbit anti‐pT217‐tau at 1:200 (cat # 44‐744, Thermo Fisher). The antiserum was produced against a chemically synthesized phosphopeptide derived from the region of human tau that contains threonine 217. Both primary antibodies for pT217‐tau produced comparable results; (3) mouse anti‐EEA1 at 1:250 (cat# 610456, BD Biosciences); (4) mouse anti‐Amyloid‐β1‐42 IgG2b (clone MOAB‐2) at 1:300 (cat# NBP213075, Novus). This antibody recognizes unaggregated, oligomeric, and fibrillary forms of Aβ42 and unaggregated Aβ40, and has been previously used in aged macaque tissue to characterize Braak stage III/IV AD‐like pathology; (5) mouse antiphosphoSer202/Thr205‐tau IgG1k (clone AT8) at 1:300 (cat# MN1020; Thermo Fisher Scientific); (6) mouse monoclonal casein kinase Iδ Antibody (cat #sc‐55553, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (7) goat polyclonal casein kinase Iδ Antibody (cat #NB100‐2919; Novus Biologicals). The specificity and selectivity of the primary antibodies have been characterized using immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay approaches in various tissue types in multiple species. Normal sera and immunoglobulin G (IgG)‐free BSA were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. All chemicals and supplies for electron microscopy were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and Electron Microscopy Sciences, respectively.\nSingle pre‐embedding peroxidase immunocytochemistry\nAs described previously, the sections were incubated for 72 hours at 4°C with primary antibodies in TBS, and transferred for 2 hours at room temperature to species‐specific biotinylated Fab’ or F(ab’)2 fragments in TBS. To reveal immunoperoxidase labeling, sections were incubated with the avidin–biotin peroxidase complex (ABC; 1:300; Vector Laboratories) and then visualized in 0.025% Ni‐intensified 3,3‐diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma Aldrich) as a chromogen in 100 mM phosphate buffer (PB) with the addition of 0.005% hydrogen peroxide for 8 minutes. After the DAB reaction, sections were exposed to osmification (concentration 1%), dehydration through a series of increasing ethanol concentrations (70%–100%), and infiltrated with propylene oxide. Tissue sections were counterstained with 1% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol. Standard epoxy resin embedding followed typical immunoEM procedures followed by polymerization at 60°C for 60 hours. Omission of primary antibodies or substitution with non‐immune serum resulted in complete lack of immunoperoxidase labeling. Similarly, labeling was nullified when blocking the biotinylated probes with avidin/biotin.\nDouble‐label pre‐embedding gold and peroxidase immunohistochemistry\nDouble‐label immunoEM was accomplished by pairing gold (for Aβ) and DAB (for pT217‐tau) in dlPFC of two “late‐aged” female macaques, aged 24 and 26 years. Sections underwent a 50 mM glycine in 0.1 M PBS incubation for 1 hour (Sigma, cat# G‐7126), a 30 minute 0.3% hydrogen peroxide incubation at 4°C, and avidin–biotin blocking (Vector cat# SP‐2001) to prevent non‐specific labeling from free aldehydes, and the immunoperoxidase product, respectively. Sections were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature (RT; 5% BSA, 10% NGS, 0.4% Triton X‐100, and 0.1% Aurion acetylated BSA, or BSA‐c, Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat# 25557, in 0.1 M PB), and incubated in Anaspec rabbit anti‐pT217‐tau at 1:200 for 72 hours at 4°C. After removal from the primary antibody incubation, sections were incubated in biotinylated F(ab’)2 fragment goat anti‐rabbit at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch cat# 111‐066‐144) for 3 hours at RT, and then underwent avidin–biotin amplification using ABC, as above, and were visualized using a DAB kit (Vector SK‐4100) with no nickel intensification for 3 minutes. Then, sections were incubated in the mouse anti‐Amyloid‐β1‐42 at 1:300 for 72 hours at 4°C. After removal from the primary antibody, sections were incubated in Aurion F(ab) fragment of goat anti‐mouse ultrasmall at 1:50 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat#25415) for 3 hours at RT. Subsequently, sections underwent a 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) postfix for 5 minutes, followed by a 10 minute 50 mM glycine incubation to quench free aldehydes, and a few quick distilled water washes. Silver enhancement was performed with the Nanoprobes HQ Silver kit (cat# 2012‐45ML) in the dark for 20 to 30 minutes, and produced variable‐sized particles.\nSections were first post‐fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0,1 M PBS for 20 minutes, then were submerged in 1% osmium tetroxide in PB, followed by immediate dilution by half (to 0.5%), and the sections incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 4°C. Sections then proceeded with the remainder of EM processing steps as described in the preceding section.\nElectron microscopy and data analysis\nFor single‐label immunoperoxidase immunohistochemistry, sections were mounted on microscope slides and ERC layer II and dlPFC layer III were photographed under an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam charge‐coupled device camera. Zeiss AxioVision imaging software was used for imaging and data acquisition. All sections were processed as previously described and immunoEM imaging was conducted in ERC layer II and dlPFC layer III. Briefly, blocks containing ERC layer II and dlPFC layer III were sampled and mounted on resin blocks. The specimens were cut into 50 nm sections using an ultramicrotome (Leica) and analyzed under a Talos L120C transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Several plastic blocks of each brain were examined using the 4th to 12th surface‐most sections of each block (i.e., 200–600 nm), to sample the superficial component of sections, avoiding penetration artifacts. Structures were digitally captured at ×25,000 to ×100,000 magnification with a Ceta complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera and individual panels were adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CC.2020.01 image editing software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Approximately 5000 micrographs of selected areas of neuropil with immunopositive profiles were used for analyses with well‐defined criteria.\nFor profile identification, we adopted the criteria summarized in Peters et al. Dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex are typically long and thin, devoid of mitochondria, with the presence of a noticeable postsynaptic density (PSD) at asymmetric synapses, and often containing an elaborated spine apparatus, the extension of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum into the spine. Dendritic shafts were typically round in perpendicular planes or irregular shaped when assessed in horizontal planes, usually containing mitochondria and numerous tubular and pleomorphic cellular organelles. Depending on the proximity to axon terminals, various dendritic shafts received synaptic inputs. Axon terminals contained accumulations of synaptic vesicles and the axoplasm of these terminals usually contained neurofilaments and mitochondria. The synaptic innervations made by these axon terminals were either asymmetric, containing spherical vesicles, or symmetric, containing pleomorphic vesicles, with typical differences in PSD, respectively. Unmyelinated axons were small, round processes with a predominantly even and regular shape, traversing the neuropil in a straight orientation, often forming bundles in perpendicular planes. Astrocytic processes were typically of irregular morphology, forming contours that filled the empty space around neuronal elements.\nTo evaluate whether there was concordance between dendrites immunopositive for pT217‐tau and signatures of autophagic degeneration, quantitative assessments were performed on a series of low and high magnification 2D micrographs of ERC layer II and supragranular dlPFC layer III. Each field covered an area of 15 to 30 μm2 captured from the thin sections in early‐aged ERC and late‐aged dlPFC in rhesus macaques for analyses. Approximately 200 micrographs of selected areas of neuropil with immunopositive profiles were used for quantitative analyses. Autophagic vacuoles were identified based on multilamellar bodies, containing partially degraded cytoplasmic materials. The frequency of pT217‐tau positive elements was highly consistent across all animals and pooled across animals within an age group.\nImmunofluorescence with confocal microscopy\nImmunofluorescence staining was carried out on free‐floating sections as described previously. Three adult (8–10 years), two “early” aged (18–19 years), and four “late” aged (28–34 years) rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used in this study. Antigen retrieval was performed with 10 mM solution citrate buffer in a hot water bath for 25 minutes at high temperature. The free‐floating sections were left to cool for 30 minutes at RT. The sections were transferred to 1X TBS for 10 minutes. Sections were then incubated in 0.5% sodium borohydride in 0.01 M TBS. Sections were blocked for 1 hour at RT in 1X TBS containing 5% BSA, 2% Triton X‐100, and 10% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated for 72 hours at 4°C with pT217‐tau primary antibody (dilution 1:100; see supplier information above), MAP2 (dilution 1:1000; ab5392, Abcam), mouse antiphosphoSer202/Thr205‐tau IgG1k (clone AT8; dilution 1:300; cat# MN1020; Thermo Fisher Scientific), casein kinase Iδ antibody (dilution 1:100; cat #sc‐55553, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal casein kinase Iδ antibody (dilution 1:100; cat #NB100‐2919; Novus Biologicals) ,followed by incubation overnight at 4°C with secondary antibodies (1:1000, Alexa‐Fluor conjugated, Invitrogen). After incubation in secondary antibodies, they were incubated in 70% ethanol with 0.3% Sudan Black B (MP Biomedicals, cat# 4197‐25‐5), to decrease autofluorescence from lipofuscin, and counterstained with Hoechst (1:10,000, Thermo Fisher, cat# H3570). The sections were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, cat# P36930). Confocal images from ERC layer II and dlPFC layer III were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan Confocal Microscope, with the C‐Apochromat 40x/1.2 W Korr FCS M27 (Zeiss) water objective. Emission filter bandwidths and sequential scanning acquisition were set up to avoid possible spectral overlaps between fluorophores. Images were merged using Fiji software.\nMeasurement of pT217‐tau in blood plasma by nanoneedles\nFifteen young (1–17 years) and twenty‐one aged (18–34 years) rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used in the plasma pT217‐tau study (total cohort N = 36). Blood plasma was collected during routine tuberculosis testing for rhesus macaques. We developed in‐house phosphorylated tau assays using the nanoneedle technology to measure plasma concentrations of pT217‐tau. More than 20,000 nanoneedles are integrated on a silicon substrate assigned to detect one analyte. Each nanoneedle is a single‐molecule biosensor functionalized with antibodies. Because phosphorylated tau in blood samples is present at low abundance, the binding events of phosphorylated tau on the nanoneedle sensor array follow Poisson statistics, that is, one or no molecule is captured on each nanoneedle. This allows precise quantitation of analytes by digitally counting the number of nanoneedles that have a positive signal. In the present study, we developed sandwich‐type pT217‐tau assays to measure the ultra‐low concentration of protein levels in patient blood samples. The nanoneedle chip was provided by NanoMosaic. Nanoneedles are fabricated in an array format with a spacing of 1.8 μm. Each nanoneedle has a diameter of < 100 nm. The nanoneedle surfaces were modified with 0.5% 3‐aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) and activated with 2% glutaraldehyde. This enables antibodies to covalently bind on the surface of the nanoneedles. We used 5 μg/ml capture antibody concentration and incubated with chip overnight. We then washed the chip in PBS and incubated it with blocking solution for 1 hour. Five μl of plasma samples were thawed and diluted 2 X into the dilution buffer provided by NanoMosaic. The diluted sample was incubated on the chip for 2 hours. After washing, a biotinylated detection antibody at 0.5 μg/ml was incubated on the chip. Next, 0.5 μg/ml streptavidin‐horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was incubated for 30 minutes, and 3,3′,5,5′‐tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) provided by NanoMosaic was applied on the chip for 15 minutes to illuminate the HRP. The enzymatic reaction produced a non‐soluble precipitate on the nanoneedles when the sandwich complex was present. The precipitate changes the local refractive index of the nanoneedle and induces a color shift intrinsic to the nanoneedle property. The nanoneedles are imaged under a dark‐field configuration with a CMOS color camera before and after the assay using the Tessie™ instrument from NanoMosaic. Software provided by NanoMosaic analyzed the colors of all nanoneedles and reported the percentage of the color‐shifted number of nanoneedles. We used phospho‐specific antibodies to pT217‐tau (Thermo Fisher 44‐744) as the detection antibodies for pT217‐tau measurement. The specificity of the phospho‐specific antibodies to pT217‐tau was validated with peptide array, described in the following section.\nThe protein levels are reported in relative units specific to the nanoneedle technology (i.e., Nano Unit) as described in previous studies because pT217‐tau recombinant protein standards are not available at present. All measurement results were above the lower limit of detection of the nanoneedle assay. Assay specificity was validated with dot blot measurement of the phospho‐specific antibodies against an array of synthesized peptides phosphorylated at different residues along the full‐length tau protein as described in a previous study. \nStatistical analysis of rhesus macaque blood plasma pT217‐tau data\nTo assess age‐related alterations in pT217‐tau expression in blood plasma during age span, a Pearson's correlation regression analysis was computed. For group analysis, a Welch t test was performed because the pT217‐tau expression in blood plasma was normally distributed. Fits were modelled as linear and exponential growth equations."

        "title": "Air pollution and plasma amyloid beta in a cohort of older adults: Evidence from the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study",
        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "Air pollution has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), but the mechanisms connecting air pollution to ADRD have not been firmly established. Air pollution may cause oxidative stress and neuroinflammation and contribute to the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain. We examined the association between fine particulate matter<2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), particulate matter<10 μm in diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and plasma based measures of Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 using data from 3044 dementia-free participants of the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS). Air pollution exposures were estimated at residential addresses that incorporated address histories dating back to 1980, resulting in one-, five-, 10- and 20- year exposure averages. Aβ was measured at baseline (2000–2002) and then again at the end of the study (2007–2008) allowing for linear regression models to assess cross-sectional associations and linear random effects models to evaluate repeated measures. After adjustment for socio-demographic and behavioral covariates, we found small positive associations between each air pollutant and Aβ1–40 but no association with Aβ1–42 or the ratio measures in cross sectional analysis. In repeat measures analysis, we found larger positive associations between each air pollutant and all three outcomes. We observed a 4.43% (95% CI 3.26%, 5.60%) higher Aβ1–40 level, 9.73% (6.20%, 13.38%) higher Aβ1–42 and 1.57% (95% CI: 0.94%, 2.20%) higher Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio associated with a 2 μg/m3 higher 20-year average PM2.5. Associations with other air pollutants were similar. Our study contributes to the broader evidence base on air pollution and ADRD biomarkers by evaluating longer air pollution exposure averaging periods to better mimic disease progression and provides a modifiable target for ADRD prevention.",
            "Method": "Materials and methods\nThis study consisted of 3,069 adults aged 75 years or older who were free of dementia at baseline and enrolled in the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS), a randomized double-blind controlled trial originally designed to evaluate the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba on AD and dementia. Participants were recruited from four US study sites (Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Hagerstown, Maryland; Sacramento, California; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) between 2000 and 2002 and followed through 2008. Participants were censored upon death, the development of ADRD or loss to follow-up. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Washington and all institutions affiliated with the trial.\nExposure ascertainment\nPrimary exposures of interest were long-term residential concentrations of fine particulate matter<2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), particulate matter<10 μm in diameter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) estimated at participant residential addresses. Address histories dating back to 1980 (20 years prior to study entry) were reconstructed using data from LexisNexis (LN), a data analytics corporation that applies a proprietary algorithm to publicly available real estate, driver’s license, voting and court records to identify residential history. LN has been used by a few previous epidemiologic studies to create residential histories. For individuals missing historical residential address data, we used air pollution estimates from last known residential address. More information on the reconstruction of residential histories can be found in the supplement of.\nA previously-described spatiotemporal model was then applied to individual addresses to predict air pollution concentrations at participant’s address. Briefly, the model uses inputs from EPA monitoring data and over 300 geographic covariates to predict air pollution. External validation statistics show good performance of the air pollution prediction models, with R2 ranging from 0.84 to 0.91 for PM2.5 and 0.78 to 0.88 for NO2. Several exposure metrics reflecting different averaging periods were created to better understand when during the life course exposure to air pollution was most strongly associated with Aβ and to better reflect the development of ADRD. Exposure to PM2.5 was estimated by averaging one, five, ten, and 20 years of modeled PM2.5 prior to the date of blood draw. Estimates of PM10 and NO2 were based only on one-, five- and ten-year exposure metrics because data were not available to create a 20-year prediction.\nOutcome ascertainment\nPrimary outcomes of interest were levels of plasma Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio. The ratio of Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40, both in plasma and CSF, has been found to improve diagnosis of AD relative to Aβ1–42 alone and is used frequently in research. Aβ levels were measured from stored blood samples collected in 2000–2002 and 2007–2008 using a sandwich ELISA initially developed by Eli Lilly and implemented at the University of Vermont Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry. Interassay coefficients of variation ranged from 3.1% to 7.9% for Aβ1–40 and 12.0% to 20.0% for Aβ1–42.\nCovariates\nCovariates included basic socio-demographic characteristics: continuous age, sex (male or female), race (white or person of color), education (high school or less, some college, college graduate or postgraduate), and study site (Winston-Salem, NC; Sacramento, CA; Hagerstown, MD; and Pittsburgh, PA). Although the GEMS clinical trial was negative, treatment assignment (Ginkgo biloba vs placebo) was included to account for potential differences between the two arms of the original study. Cystatin C (from plasma collected at the same time as Aβ) was an additional covariate given its role in binding to soluble Aβ and inhibiting Aβ deposition in the brain.\nA neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) was created for all GEMS participants because of the lack of data on individual income and to account for its potential role as a confounder between air pollution and Aβ. Annual NDI values for each participant were based on the census tract of residence and were created from decennial Census data from 1980, 1990, 2000 and American Community Survey (ACS) 2005–2009. Previous research used over 30 Census variables to conduct a principal components analysis (PCA) to identify the variables that most strongly represented the latent construct of neighborhood disadvantage. Seven variables were identified from the PCA (% of adults age 25 or older with at least a high school education; % of adults age 25 or older with at least a Bachelor’s degree; % of persons age 16 and older with executive, managerial, or professional occupation; median value of owner occupied housing units; median household income; % of households with income of at least $50,000; and % of households with interest, dividend, or net rental income) and weighted according to factor loadings (see supplementary material for more information).\nCovariates to account for behavioral factors were smoking status (current, former, never), pack-years smoking, percentage of life exposed to secondhand smoke (created by dividing the number of years exposed to secondhand smoke by age at baseline), alcohol consumption (yes/no), and physical activity. We created a physical activity score based on responses to questions from the GEMS questionnaires that are adapted from components of the validated Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire designed to assess physical activity in adults aged 65 years and older. The total physical activity score was calculated from answers to questions about the frequency of engaging in seven activities: gardening and yard work, walking, volunteering, assisting family or friends, hunting, fishing or camping, babysitting and shopping. Response options were “never or less than once a month”, “once a month”, “few (2–3) times a month”, “once a week”, “few (2–3) times a week” and “every day”. Responses were assigned a score of 0–5 and then summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 35 (potential maximum total score) with higher scores indicating greater physical activity. Missing values were imputed by taking the average of the non-missing responses within each participant if at least 3 of the questions had complete data. In the present study, we used physical activity data collected one year after baseline (nearest the blood sample collection in 2000–2002) and carried forward to missing measurements at the 2007–2008 visit in participants with non-missing data.\nApolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) carrier status (yes/no), hypertension (defined as anti-hypertensive medication use or systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg and recorded one year after baseline) and body mass index (BMI) created from measured height and weight were also included as covariates. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was defined using guidelines from the International Working group on mild cognitive impairment and provided for descriptive purposes as was participant’s average score on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE).\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Due to the skewed nature of Aβ, a one percent Winsorization was performed, i.e., values less than or equal to the first percentile of the distribution were set to the minimum value. For Aβ1–40 these values corresponded to 56.75 and 28.73 pg/mL in 2000–02 or 2007–08 respectively and for Aβ1–42 they were 0.75 and 0.77 pg/mL respectively. Winsorized values were then log transformed (Fig. 1). To create Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio, we first log-transformed the numerator and denominator before dividing the values. Given the continuous nature of the outcomes, cross-sectional associations were examined using ordinary least squares regression. Repeated measures analyses were evaluated using linear random effects models with a random intercept for participant. Results were reported as percent differences with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nA staged modeling approach was used to assess the impact of adding increasingly more covariates. Model 1 included basic socio-demographic characteristics (continuous age, sex, race, education, study site, treatment assignment, Cystatin C and NDI). Model 2 included Model 1 covariates plus smoking history, alcohol consumption, pack-years smoking, percentage of life exposed to secondhand smoke and physical activity. Model 3 included Model 2 covariates plus APOE ε4, and Model 4 included Model 3 covariates plus hypertension and BMI. As these variables are potentially on the causal pathway between air pollution and Aβ, they were included at the last stage. We considered model 3 as the primary model of interest. Age, Cystatin C, NDI, BMI and hypertension were treated as time-varying in the random effects models.\nData in 2000–02 were carried forward for two individuals missing data on non-time-varying covariates in 2007–08. Most covariates had ≤ 8% missing data with the exception of APOE ε4 which had about 20% missingness. We implemented multiple imputation using chained equations (MICE) to handle missing continuous and categorical covariates. Separate MICE procedures were implemented for each combination of air pollution metric and Aβ outcome at baseline and repeat measures. Logistic or multinomial regression models were specified to impute missing categorical variables. Predictive mean matching was used to impute missing continuous variables. All covariates were included as predictors in the imputation models, but we also included time-varying 3MSE scores as they are potentially informative variables. Ten imputed datasets were constructed using 50 iterations per imputation. Final models were evaluated on all ten imputed datasets and parameter estimates and standard errors were pooled according to Rubin’s rules.\nIn addition to our main analysis, we conducted a secondary analysis to explore the association between air pollution and Aβ outcomes among those with and without MCI. This analysis assessed whether or not plasma Aβ biomarkers show different trajectories for cognitively intact individuals versus those exhibiting some cognitive impairment irrespective of if they go on to develop ADRD. We ran stratified models for both cross-sectional and repeated measures analysis using only Model 3 covariates and the longer-term averaging periods for air pollutants.\nTwo sensitivity analyses are also presented. First, to explore the impact of our approach to handling outliers we constructed models using a) the original distribution of values and b) excluding those that were less than or equal to the first percentile. Second, to account for potential selection bias among participants who remained in the study until the end of follow-up (those with repeated Aβ measurements), we ran separate OLS models with baseline and follow-up Aβ as the outcome among only those participants with repeated Aβ measurements (i.e., we did not include those who only had baseline values of Aβ).\nAnalyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). MICE was performed using PROC MI/PROC MIANALYZE in SAS, and plots were generated using R version 4.0.4 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). All statistical tests were two-sided and considered significant at p-value < 0.05."

            "Abstract": "Background\nPlasma biomarkers are preferable to invasive and expensive diagnostic tools, such as neuroimaging and lumbar puncture that are gold standard in the clinical management of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Here, we investigated plasma Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) and Phosphorylated-tau-181 (pTau 181) in AD and in its early stages: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and Mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nMaterial and methods\nThis study included 152 patients (42 SCD, 74 MCI and 36 AD). All patients underwent comprehensive clinical and neurological assessment. Blood samples were collected for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and plasma biomarker (GFAP, NfL, and pTau 181) measurements. Forty-three patients (7 SCD, 27 MCI, and 9 AD) underwent a follow-up (FU) visit after 2 years, and a second plasma sample was collected. Plasma biomarker levels were detected using the Simoa SR-X technology (Quanterix Corp.). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 28 (IBM SPSS Statistics). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.\nResults\nGFAP, NfL and pTau 181 levels in plasma were lower in SCD and MCI than in AD patients. In particular, plasma GFAP levels were statistically significant different between SCD and AD (p=0.003), and between MCI and AD (p=0.032). Plasma NfL was different in SCD vs MCI (p=0.026), SCD vs AD (p<0.001), SCD vs AD FU (p<0.001), SCD FU vs AD (p=0.033), SCD FU vs AD FU (p=0.011), MCI vs AD (p=0.002), MCI FU vs AD (p=0.003), MCI FU vs AD FU (p=0.003) and MCI vs AD FU (p=0.003). Plasma pTau 181 concentration was significantly different between SCD and AD (p=0.001), MCI and AD (p=0.026), MCI FU and AD (p=0.020). In APOE ϵ4 carriers, a statistically significant increase in plasma NfL (p<0.001) and pTau 181 levels was found (p=0.014). Moreover, an association emerged between age at disease onset and plasma GFAP (p = 0.021) and pTau181 (p < 0.001) levels.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nPlasma GFAP, NfL and pTau 181 are promising biomarkers in the diagnosis of the prodromic stages and prognosis of dementia.",
            "Method": "Materials and methods\nPatients\nA total of 152 patients were consecutively recruited at the Neurology Unit of Careggi Hospital in Florence from September 2018 to May 2023. At first visit, all patients underwent a comprehensive clinical and neurological assessment. Forty-two patients received a clinical diagnosis of SCD, 74 of MCI and 36 of AD. A blood sample for plasma and genetic analysis was collected at baseline for all patients, and a second plasma sample was isolated at follow-up visit, after two years, for 43 patients. During the first visit, a lumbar puncture was performed for CSF collection to analyze Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40, total‐tau (t‐tau) and p‐tau biomarkers. CSF samples were collected from 32 SCD patients, 66 MCI patients, and 34 AD patients. After collection, the CSF sample was immediately centrifuged and stored at −80 °C until testing. CSF biomarkers were measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) analyzer LUMIPULSE G600 (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan). Cut-off values for CSF were determined by following Fujirebio guidelines and normal values were: Aβ42> 670 pg/mL, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio > 0.062, t‐tau < 400 pg/mL and p‐tau < 60 pg/mL.\nAccording to the ATN system and considering only the CSF analysis, we classified patients as: A+ = CSF amyloid biomarkers (Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40) lower than the cut-off values; A- = normal values of CSF amyloid biomarkers; T+ = CSF p-tau higher than the cut-off value; T- = CSF p-tau lower than the cut-off value; N+ = CSF t-tau higher than the cut-off value; N- = normal value of CSF t-tau. Therefore, we considered as “CSF +”, all the patients that had the following biomarker profiles: A+/T+/N+, A+/T-/N-, A+/T-/N+ and A-/T+/N+. In the other cases, patients were classified as “CSF –”.\nProgression to MCI and AD was established according to the NIA‐AA criteria. Age at baseline was the age at the time of plasma collection. A positive family history was defined as one or more first degree relatives with documented cognitive decline. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Helsinki Declaration.\nPlasma analysis\nPlasma was isolated from peripheral blood sample within 2 hours from collection. Blood sample was centrifuged at 4° at 1300 rcf for 10 minutes. The supernatant was immediately collected and stored at -80° until tested. Plasma analysis was performed on the automated Single molecule assay (Simoa) SR-X platform (Quanterix corp.). For GFAP and NfL measurement, the Simoa Human Neurology 2-Plex B assay (N2PB) (Item 103520) was used. The assay range of GFAP was 0 - ~40000 pg/mL, instead of NfL was 0 - ~2000 pg/mL. The N2PB kit analytical Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) was for GFAP 4.15 pg/mL (pooled CV 16%, mean recovery 101%; Functional LLOQ = 16.6 pg/mL) and for NfL 0.400 pg/mL (pooled CV 18%, mean recovery 101%; Functional LLOQ = 1.60 pg/mL). The N2PB kit Limit of Detection (LOD) was 0.410 pg/mL (range 0.133-0.740 pg/mL) for GFAP and 0.071 pg/mL (range 0.012-0.149 pg/mL) for NfL measurements. Quality controls (1= low protein level, 2= high protein level) were included in the run (GFAP control 1= 94.8 pg/mL, control 2= 12701 pg/mL; NfL control 1= 4.21 pg/mL, control 2= 556 pg/mL). pTau 181 was detected using the Simoa® pTau-181 Advantage V2.1 Kit (Item 104111). The Analytical LLOQ of the pTau 181 kit was 2.23 pg/mL (pooled CV 19.0%, mean recovery 97.0%; Functional LLOQ =8.92 pg/mL), instead the LOD was 1.04 pg/mL (range 0.146-1.750 pg/mL). pTau 181 quality controls were: control 1= 50.5 pg/mL, control 2= 530 pg/mL. The N2PB and pTau 181 kit analysis in all samples were performed in a single run basis, respectively. All plasma samples were diluted to 1:4. A reference calibration curve was established using serially diluted calibrators, provided by Quanterix. Plasma samples, calibrators, and controls were run in duplicate.\nApolipoprotein E genotyping\nGenomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples with the QIAamp DNA blood mini QIAcube Kit (Qiagen, Germany), using the automatized extractor Qiacube, provided by Qiagen Corp, following the manufacturer protocol. DNA amount and quality was checked with the QIAxpert spectrophotometer (Qiagen, Germany). APOE genotypes were investigated using two sets of PCR primers designed to amplify the regions encompassing rs7412 [NC_000019.9:g.45412079C > T] and rs429358 (NC_000019.9:g.45411941T > C) and PCR products were analyzed by the high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA). Control samples with known APOE genotypes, validated by DNA sequencing, were used as standard references.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 28 (IBM SPSS Statistics). Continuous variables were correlated using Pearson’s correlation analysis. Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test the normal distribution of data. To analyze differences between groups, we used independent-samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal Wallis test and ANOVA test for differences between more than two groups. Welch t-test was performed when the assumption of homogeneity of variances was violated. To test whether the difference between two proportions is statistically significant we used Fisher's exact test. p < .05 was set as significant. Continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation. Allele frequency of APOE ϵ4 was determined by counting and calculating sample proportions."

            "Method": "METHODS\nData source\nData were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu), accessed on September 23, 2023. The ADNI cohort was launched in 2003 as part of a public–private partnership, with Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD, overseeing the project. Approval for the ADNI study was granted by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their authorized representatives.\nParticipants and grouping situation\nThe comprehensive enrollment process and inclusion criteria for various diagnostic categories within the ADNI cohort have been previously documented. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) age > 55 years; (2) initial diagnosis of CN and MCI with a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of either 0 or 0.5; (3) a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS‐15) score < 6; (4) availability of blood pressure (BP) data at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years; (5) availability of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuropsychological assessments, and pNfL data at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years; (6) baseline availability of AD‐related CSF biomarkers. Exclusion criteria were applied as follows: (1) the usage of any psychoactive medications, (2) a diagnosis of dementia, (3) markedly elevated pNfL levels > 179 pg/mL to exclude conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and others. \nAccording to the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association criteria, Aβ positivity can be defined as the AD continuum. For this study, Aβ positivity was defined as Aβ42 < 977 pg/mL, while Aβ negativity was defined as Aβ42 ≥ 977 pg/mL, aligning with established standards. Following the criteria established by Cedres et al., a high WMH burden was characterized by WMH volume adjusted total intracranial volume values > 0.00321, while a low WMH burden was defined as adjusted WMH volume ≤ 0.00321. We use Aβ positivity status to represent the presence of AD pathology and a high WMH burden to signify the presence of CSVD pathology. We compared the differences in BPV and pNfL among different disease groups. The disease groups were defined as follows: Aβ‐negative individuals with low WMH burden were categorized as Aβ−WMH− (controls), Aβ‐negative individuals with high WMH burden were categorized as Aβ−WMH+, Aβ‐positive individuals with low WMH burden were categorized as Aβ+WMH−, and Aβ‐positive individuals with high WMH burden were categorized as Aβ+WMH+, indicating the comorbidity of AD and CSVD.\nNeuropsychological assessments\nCertified raters conducted the neuropsychological assessments following standardized ADNI protocols (www.adni‐info.org). Various scales were used to evaluate cognition, including CDR, Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), memory composite score, and executive composite score. Neuropsychological assessment data at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years were obtained from the ADNI file (“MMSE.csv,” “MOCA.csv,” “CDR.csv,” “UWNPSYCHSUM.csv”).\nRESEARCH IN CONTEX\n Systematic review: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) often co‐occur in the aging population, yet the underlying mechanisms linking the two remain ambiguous. Studies have revealed associations of long‐term blood pressure variability (BPV) and plasma neurofilament light (pNfL) with AD and CSVD, indicating a potential association between BPV, pNfL, and the comorbidity of AD and CSVD. However, the relationship between BPV, pNfL, and their association with comorbidity remains unexplored.\n Interpretation: Analyses revealed that elevated BPV was associated with pNfL, hippocampal atrophy, white matter hyperintensity progression, and poorer cognition. Moreover, pNfL mediated the effect of BPV on brain structure and cognitive function. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential role of BPV in the mechanisms of comorbidity between AD and CSVD, suggesting that a common risk factor may contribute to the brain pathology associated with both conditions.\n Future directions: It will be necessary to validate the relationship between BPV and pNfL or other axonal injury markers in the prodromal stages of AD. Furthermore, longitudinal tracking and assessment are needed to evaluate the relationship between BPV and the comorbidity of AD and CSVD.\nNeuroimaging data\nMRI examinations adhered to the ADNI MRI scanning protocol. Four brain tissue (gray matter [including hippocampus], white matter, CSF, and WMH) segmentation methods have been described previously; a thorough description can be found in the ADNI reference documentation “Four Tissue Segmentation in ADNI II.” Brain volume data (including hippocampal and WMH volumes [mL]) at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years were extracted from the ADNI file (“ADNI_UCD_WMH.csv”).  \npNfL data and AD‐related CSF biomarkers\npNfL analysis was conducted using the single molecule array (Simoa) technique at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Mölndal Campus, Mölndal, Sweden (detailed information available elsewhere: http://adni.loni.usc.edu). CSF samples were collected through lumbar puncture to assess Aβ42, phosphorylated tau (p‐tau)181, and total tau concentrations. CSF samples were analyzed using the Roche automated immunoassay platform (Cobas e601) and immunoassay reagents at the University of Pennsylvania. The pNfL data at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years were obtained from the ADNI file (“ADNI_BLENNOWPLASMANFLLONG.csv”). AD‐related CSF biomarkers at baseline and 2 years were retrieved from the ADNI file (“UPENNBIOMK_MASTER.csv”).\nBP and BPV assessments\nSeated brachial artery systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were taken from participants at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, following a standardized ADNI protocol described elsewhere (www.adni‐info.org). We calculated the average BP and BPV index, including standard deviation (SD) and variation independent of mean (VIM). VIM is a widely used index for long‐term BPV, computed using the formula VIM = SD/meanx, where x is calculated using a fitting function. The average BP and BPV of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were computed. In this study, we mainly used VIM for BPV analysis.\nOther assessments and data collection\nThe following data were gathered from the clinical evaluation file (“ADNIMERGE.csv,” “RECMHIST.csv,” “VITALS.csv”): years of education, current smoking status, height, weight, usage of anti‐dementia and anti‐hypertensive medications, and the presence of vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation. The general Framingham Heart Study (FHS) score was calculated to assess vascular risk. The general FHS score comprises a weighted sum of sex, age, total lipoprotein cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, SBP, treatment for hypertension, current smoking status, and diabetes mellitus status. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype information was extracted from the ADNI file (“APOERES.csv”). Participants possessing at least one copy of the APOE ε4 allele were categorized as APOE ε4 carriers.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using R Programming (version 4.2.2). Statistical significance was set at a two‐tailed P < 0.05.\nContinuous variables not conforming to a normal distribution underwent transformations before regression analysis. MMSE and MoCA scores were z transformed, while WMH volume, pNfL, CSF Aβ42, p‐tau181, and total tau levels were log transformed. One‐way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction addressed multiple comparisons for normally distributed data. The chi‐square test was used to compare categorical variables, whereas the Kruskal–Wallis with Bonferroni correction was applied to handle multiple comparisons for non–normally distributed continuous variables. The differences in average BP, BPV, baseline biomarkers, and baseline cognitive performance among different groups were compared. As there were variations in age and sex distribution across different groups, a multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to adjust for these factors and calculate the adjusted differences in the indicators among these groups.\nTo explore the relationship between BPV and pNfL, BPV indexes were categorized into tertiles. The differences in pNfL levels among different BPV tertile groups were compared. P values were computed using a multivariate linear model, adjusting for FHS score, APOE ε4 status, cognitive status, Aβ status, anti‐hypertensive treatments, and average BP. The longitudinal relationship between BPV and pNfL, adjusted for the aforementioned confounding factors, was assessed using a linear mixed‐effects model. Random effects included participant‐specific intercepts, while fixed effects incorporated the main effects of BPV, with adjustments for previously mentioned confounding variables. The analysis also examined the longitudinal relationship between BPV or pNfL with brain structure (including hippocampal and WMH volumes) and cognitive performance using the same modeling approach.  \nCausal mediation analyses were used to investigate whether the associations between BPV and brain structural changes and cognition at 2 years were mediated by pNfL. According to the approach proposed by Baron and Kenny, the following criteria need to be met simultaneously to establish the mediation effect: (1) significant association between BPV and pNfL, (2) significant association between BPV and brain structural changes and cognition, (3) significant association between pNfL and brain structural changes and cognition, (4) weakening of the associations between BPV and brain structural changes and cognition when pNfL (mediator) was included in the regression model. Furthermore, chain mediation analyses were used to investigate whether the association between BPV and cognition at 2 years was mediated by pNfL and brain structural changes. The extent of attenuation or indirect effect was estimated, and significance was determined using 1000 bootstrapped iterations with the “mediate” and “bruceR” package. Each path of the model was adjusted for the aforementioned confounding factors."

            "Abstract": "Background\n“Brain-predicted age” estimates biological age from complex, nonlinear features in neuroimaging scans. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD), but is underexplored in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), in which AD progression is highly predictable with minimal confounding age-related co-pathology.\nMethods\nWe modeled BAG in 257 deeply-phenotyped ADAD mutation-carriers and 179 non-carriers from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network using minimally-processed structural MRI scans. We then tested whether BAG differed as a function of mutation and cognitive status, or estimated years until symptom onset, and whether it was associated with established markers of amyloid (PiB PET, CSF amyloid-β-42/40), phosphorylated tau (CSF and plasma pTau-181), neurodegeneration (CSF and plasma neurofilament-light-chain [NfL]), and cognition (global neuropsychological composite and CDR-sum of boxes). We compared BAG to other MRI measures, and examined heterogeneity in BAG as a function of ADAD mutation variants, APOE ε4 carrier status, sex, and education.\nResults\nAdvanced brain aging was observed in mutation-carriers approximately 7 years before expected symptom onset, in line with other established structural indicators of atrophy. BAG was moderately associated with amyloid PET and strongly associated with pTau-181, NfL, and cognition in mutation-carriers. Mutation variants, sex, and years of education contributed to variability in BAG.\nConclusions\nWe extend prior work using BAG from sporadic AD to ADAD, noting consistent results. BAG associates well with markers of pTau, neurodegeneration, and cognition, but to a lesser extent, amyloid, in ADAD. BAG may capture similar signal to established MRI measures. However, BAG offers unique benefits in simplicity of data processing and interpretation. Thus, results in this unique ADAD cohort with few age-related confounds suggest that brain aging attributable to AD neuropathology can be accurately quantified from minimally-processed MRI.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13024-023-00688-3.",
            "Method": "Methods\nParticipants\nThe sample included 436 participants from the DIAN Observational Study (data release 16). 257 participants were identified as mutation-carriers (MCs) of pathologic variants in presenilin-1 (PSEN1), presenilin-2 (PSEN2), or amyloid precursor protein (APP). PSEN1 mutation-carriers were further grouped based on the location of the underlying variant (i.e., before or after codon 200). The remaining 179 participants were non-carrier controls (NCs), recruited from the same families as the MCs. In order to characterize and correct for differences in brain age estimates between different sites and scanners, we included data only from DIAN sites with at least 5 eligible participants with a usable T1 MRI scan. For details on each site-specific sample, see Supplementary Table 1.\nEstimated years until symptom onset (EYO) was computed for each participant as the difference between the participant’s chronological age and the mean age of symptom onset for their specific mutation, as determined by a database of known mutation onsets, or the familial age of symptom onset, as determined by semistructured interview. Thus, negative EYO values reflect years until expected onset, whereas positive values reflect years after onset.\nCognitive status was determined using the Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®) scale. A CDR of 0 defines cognitive normality, while scores above 0 define increasing stages of dementia severity. MCs with CDR = 0 were identified as “asymptomatic”, while MCs with CDR > 0 were identified as “symptomatic”. APOE ε4 status was dichotomized in all participants between ε4 carriers (ε4+, including heterozygotes and homozygotes) and ε4 non-carriers (ε4-).\nDIAN participants provided informed consent in accordance with the local institutional review boards of each participating site. DIAN study procedures have received ethics approval by the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University in St. Louis (MO, USA) and all of the participating sites.\nPET & biofluid biomarkers\nAmyloid β plaque deposition was assessed using a [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET tracer. PET data were analyzed from a 30-minute acquisition window beginning 40 min after a bolus injection of approximately 15 mCi of PiB. All PiB PET scans were processed with the PET Unified Pipeline (PUP), including conventional processing steps and partial volume correction with a regional spread function (RSF). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) summarized PiB tracer binding in previously-defined summary regions, including bilateral precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus, and lateral temporal regions, using the cerebellum as a reference region.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected via lumbar puncture under fasting conditions. CSF amyloid β42 (Aβ42), amyloid β40 (Aβ40), and phosphorylated tau-181 (pTau) were measured with Lumipulse immunoassays (Fujirebio). Aβ42 and pTau estimates were normalized for individual differences in CSF production rates by forming a ratio with Aβ40 as the denominator. Neurofilament-light-chain (NfL) was measured with a Simoa HD-X platform (Quanterix).\nBlood samples were collected via venipuncture under fasting conditions. Plasma pTau and NfL were measured on a Simoa HD-X platform (Quanterix).\nCognitive battery\nParticipants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. We formed a global cognitive composite by standardizing and combining the Logical Memory delayed recall score, Digit Symbol Substitution total score, Animal Naming fluency score, and time to complete Trail Making part B.\nWe also used the CDR-Sum of Boxes as an additional measure of global dementia severity.\nMRI acquisition & processing\nStructural MRI scans were acquired on a 3T scanner using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE; echo time [TE] = 2.95 ms, repetition time [TR] = 2300 ms, inversion time [TI] = 900 ms, field of view [FOV] = 270 mm, flip angle = 9°, 225 slices, 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.2 mm3 voxels). Scanner manufacturer and model varied between DIAN sites. T1-weighted images were processed using a common minimal pipeline including brain extraction and linear registration to the MNI 152 atlas template.\nT1-weighted images were also processed with FreeSurfer 5.3. For comparison with BAG, additional analyses examined structural estimates in a priori regions of interest, including hippocampus volume, precuneus thickness, and cortical thickness in AD-specific signature regions.\nBrain age modeling\nDeepBrainNet (DBN) is a publicly available 2D convolutional neural network using the inception-resnet-v2 framework, which has previously been trained to predict age on 11,729 MRI scans from independent samples. Briefly, minimally-processed whole-brain T1-weighted images were each represented as a collection of 80 evenly spaced axial slices, which matched the slice positioning of the original DBN training set. For each participant, each of the 80 slices were provided to DBN as independent inputs. A predicted age was generated for each slice with the median output serving as the participant’s final age prediction.\nTo correct for regression dilution in the age prediction model (see Supplementary Fig. 1), we applied a linear transformation to predicted age values, adjusting for the slope and intercept from a regression model of predicted age as a function of chronological age in NCs. BAG was then calculated as the difference between corrected brain age and chronological age and this corrected value was used for statistical tests of group differences and associations with other variables. However, to avoid inflating estimates of prediction accuracy, only uncorrected age prediction values were used to evaluate model performance.\nStatistical harmonization\nSince MRI scans were collected across several DIAN sites, using a variety of scanner models, these differences might contribute non-biological variance to the brain age signal. Indeed, a Kruskall-Wallis test revealed that BAG values differed between NCs tested at different DIAN sites, χ2 (14) = 27.72, p = 0.015, and on different scanner models, χ2 (8) = 15.88, p = 0.044 (see Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Although these differences were relatively small and limited to only a few specific sites and scanners, they violated our assumption that BAG values should be centered near 0 in NCs, regardless of the site or scanner of acquisition, and had the potential to introduce unwanted noise or confound into the brain age signal.\nHence, we harmonized brain-predicted age values between sites using ComBat. We included age, sex, education, ADAD group, EYO, APOE ε4 status, and mutation variant as covariates during harmonization to preserve variance in BAG related to these variables of interest. Critically, after harmonization with ComBat, there were no significant differences in BAG values between sites, χ2 (14) = 11.70, p = 0.63, or scanners, χ2 (8) = 5.11, p = 0.75 (see Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3).\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted in R 4.2.2 (R Core Team). Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were tested, respectively, by evaluating quantile-quantile plots and with Levene’s test. Mutation group differences in demographic and descriptive variables between NCs and all MCs were tested with Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and Pearson’s χ2 (for cell counts ≥ 5) or Fisher’s exact test (for cell counts < 5) for categorical variables. DBN prediction accuracy was evaluated by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) between predicted age and true chronological age in NCs only. Test-retest reliability of MRI measures was assessed in a subset of 182 participants who had longitudinal MRI data available. See Supplementary Table 2 for a summary of these participants at the baseline visit. There was an average of 2.11 years (SD = 1.21) between longitudinal scans. Specifically, we used the ‘irr’ package to calculate the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using a 2-way mixed-effects model based on a single measurement and absolute agreement.\nMutation group differences in BAG between NCs, asymptomatic MCs, and symptomatic MCs were tested with an omnibus Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, and were followed up with post hoc Wilcoxon tests using a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.\nAs non-linear trajectories in AD biomarkers have been well established in ADAD, we modeled age-corrected BAG and other MRI measures as a function of EYO using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), similar to an approach previously applied in both ADAD and Down syndrome. Specifically, we used the ‘mgcv’ package to fit GAMMs with a restricted maximum likelihood method. GAMMs included spline terms for EYO with 4 cubic basis functions to account for non-linearity and an interaction term for mutation status. GAMMs also included categorical and linear terms for covariates, including sex, education, and APOE ε4 positivity. All GAMMs included a random effect term to account for familial relationships between MCs and NCs. Simultaneous 83.4% confidence intervals for comparison of two groups were derived for GAMM fits using a simulation-based method and were used to identify the earliest points (EYO) of significant differences between MCs and NCs. We tested for differences in the point of ADAD divergence between different MRI measures using a bootstrapping analysis in 10,000 randomly resampled simulations of the full dataset.\nContinuous relationships between BAG and estimates of amyloid, pTau, neurodegeneration, and cognition were tested using linear mixed effects models (LMEs). LMEs included a fixed term for each biomarker of interest and a group by biomarker interaction term, as well as covariates, including sex, education, and APOE ε4 positivity, and a random effect term for familial relationships. Significant group by biomarker interactions were followed-up with Pearson correlation analyses within specific subgroups. As an additional sensitivity analysis to correct for skewed distributions in the biomarker values, we also repeated the biomarker association analyses after applying a log transformation. To further characterize the complex relationships between cognition and AD progression, we tested whether BAG mediated associations between AD biomarkers and the global cognitive composite, using a non-parametric bootstrap method.\nData & code availability\nThis study utilized datasets obtained from the DIAN Observational Study (Data Freeze 16).

        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "Introduction\n While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers have been considered diagnostic biomarkers for a long time, special attention has been recently dedicated to lipoproteins and metabolites that could be potentially associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegeneration. Herein, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the levels of CSF core biomarkers including Aβ-42, TAU, and P-TAU and plasma lipoproteins and metabolites of patients with AD from the baseline cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. \nMethod\n Using the ADNI database, fourteen subclasses of lipoproteins as well as a number of lipids and fatty acids and low-molecular metabolites including amino acids, ketone bodies, and glycolysis-related metabolites in blood samples were measured as potential noninvasive markers, and their association with the CSF core biomarkers was statistically investigated controlling for age and gender. \nResults\n A total number of 251 AD subjects were included, among whom 71 subjects were negative for the Apo-E ε4 allele and 150 were positive. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding cognitive assessments, CSF core biomarkers, and lipoproteins and metabolites except the level of Aβ-42 (p < 0.001) and phenylalanine (p = 0.049), which were higher in the negative group. CSF TAU and P-TAU were significantly correlated with medium and small HDL in the negative group, and with extremely large VLDL in the positive group. Our results also indicated significant correlations of metabolites including unsaturated fatty acids, glycerol, and leucine with CSF core biomarkers. \nConclusion\n Based on our findings, a number of lipoproteins and metabolites were associated with CSF core biomarkers of AD. These correlations showed some differences in Apo-E ε4 positive and negative groups, which reminds the role of Apo-E gene status in the pathophysiology of AD development. However, further research is warranted to explore the exact association of lipoproteins and other metabolites with AD core biomarkers and pathology.",
            "Method": "2. Methods\n2.1. Data and Participants\nThe data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the US Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Further information about ADNI can be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for ADNI participants are detailed at http://adni.loni.usc.edu. Briefly, all participants included in the ADNI database were from 55 to 90 years old, had 6 years or more of education, spoke English or Spanish fluently, and were without any severe neurological diseases except AD. In ADNI, participants were classified as cognitively normal (CN), MCI, or AD based on criteria comprehensively discussed on the ADNI website. The AD group met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for AD.\nIn this study, we included all patients with AD diagnosis for whom data including demographics, Apo-E gene status, cognitive assessments (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)), CSF AD-related proteins (Aβ-42, TAU, and P-TAU), lipoproteins and metabolites data were available. Eventually, our study consisted of 221 AD subjects among whom 71 subjects were Apo-E ε4 negative and 150 subjects were Apo-E ε4 positive.\n2.2. Lipoproteins and Metabolites\nIn this study, lipoproteins and metabolites data were extracted from the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of human serum samples from the ADNI using the Nightingale Health platform, which is available in the ADNI database. Nightingale Health has developed an NMR-based blood biomarker analysis assay, quantifying over 220 metabolic biomarkers from a single blood sample. NMR and mass spectrometry have become key technologies in the metabolomics field. However, Nightingale's NMR platform has an advantage when compared to mass spectrometry approaches as it provides absolute concentrations of metabolic measures, rather than relative concentrations, which increases the interpretability of the biomarker data provided. Additional information regarding sample preparation and processing is available in detail at http://adni.loni.usc.edu.\nIn this study, data regarding lipoproteins, FAs, and various low-molecular metabolites including amino acids, ketone bodies, and gluconeogenesis-related metabolites, which were available in Nightingale's NMR analysis, were included. All included lipoproteins and metabolites are described in Supplementary Table 1. Briefly, 14 subclasses of lipoproteins, two apolipoproteins, 10 FAs, five glycolysis-related metabolites, nine amino acids, three ketone bodies, and two fluid balance metabolites (creatinine and albumin) were included in the final analysis.\n2.3. CSF Aβ-42, TAU, and P-TAU\nCSF Aβ-42, TAU, and P-TAU extracted from ADNI were analyzed by the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) Elecsys which is currently under development by Roche Diagnostics and not commercially available yet. Roche Elecsys is a validated and fully automated immunoassay, which is utilized in conducting in vitro tests for the quantitative determination of the concentration of the mentioned proteins in human CSF. A detailed description of the biomarkers assessments is available on ADNI.\n2.4. Statistical Analysis\nContinuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared between negative and positive Apo-E4 groups using the Mann–Whitney U test or independent-sample t-test based on the distribution of the data. Gender was compared between two groups using Pearson's chi-square test. To test the correlation between the levels of CSF A-β, TAU, and P-TAU and lipoproteins and metabolites, partial correlation tests adjusted for age and gender were performed in each negative and positive Apo-E4 group. All statistical analyses were also performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Armonk, New York, USA) and a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant."

        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "Background\nPostural dysfunction is a common problem in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may lead to functional dependency and increasing morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology of postural dysfunction in AD patients remains poorly understood.\nObjectives\nElevated intestinal permeability is an underlying contributor to multiple diseases, including AD. We aimed to investigate the association of elevated intestinal permeability with postural dysfunction in AD patients.\nDesign Setting, Participants, Measurements\nWe conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on older adults, including controls and AD patients. We investigated the associations of postural balance with plasma zonulin, a marker of elevated intestinal permeability in geriatric controls (n = 74) and patients with mild (n = 71) and moderate (n = 66) AD. We used a standardized physical performance battery to measure balance in supine, tandem, and semi-tandem positions. We also measured handgrip strength (HGS), and gait speed as markers of physical capacity.\nResults\nAD patients exhibited lower balance scores, HGS, and gait speed and higher plasma zonulin than in controls (all p < 0.05). Plasma zonulin levels demonstrated significant areas under the curves in diagnosing poor balance in AD patients (all p < 0.05). Moderate AD was associated with lower balance and physical capacity, and higher zonulin than mild AD (ALL P < 0.05). Poor scores on balance scale were associated with higher expressions of markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and muscle damage providing a mechanistic link between increased intestinal permeability and postural dysfunction in AD patients.\nConclusion\nThe results of our study show that plasma zonulin measurement may be used to diagnose postural dysfunction in AD patients. The study is relevant to non-ambulant and/or comatose AD patients with postural dysfunction. Our findings also highlight the therapeutic potential of repairing the intestinal leak to improve postural control and reduce the risk of falls in AD patients.\nGraphical abstract",
            "Method": "Materials and methods\nStudy design & participant\nWe recruited controls (n = 74) and patients with AD (n = 137) at the Department of Neurology and Stroke Medicine, Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan, after obtaining written informed consent. The diagnosis of AD was based on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, and the patients were divided into mild (MMSE score = 21–25, n = 71) and moderate (MMSE score = 10–20, p = 66) AD, as described by us previously. The recruitment criteria of participants are previously described by us in detail. Briefly, patients with recent hospitalization, joint diseases, major organ failure, and recent surgeries were excluded. The study includes Caucasian men, and ethics approval was obtained from the hospital ethics committee before data collection. This study was conducted under the declaration of Helsinki.\nHGS and body composition\nHGS was measured using a digital handgrip dynamometer (CAMRY, South El Monte, CA, USA), as described elsewhere by us. We used a bioelectrical impedance analysis scale (RENPHO, Dubai, UAE) to measure body composition, including fast mass, skeletal muscle mass (SMM), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and phase angle, as described elsewhere by us.\nMeasurement of physical capacity\nWe measured standing balance using a physical performance tool. Briefly, the participants were asked to stand unassisted without the help of a stick or walker. The balance for side-by-side, semi-tandem, and fully tandem standing was measured with a timer for 10 s or unless the participants moved. We used timed quartiles to assign the scores ranging from zero (worst performance) to four (maximal performance), as described elsewhere in detail. We used a smartwatch pedometer to measure the daily step count, and the mean values from the daily counts of the past four weeks were reported, as described previously by us.\nMeasurement of circulating biomarkers\nThe blood samples were collected in morning hours following an overnight fast, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min, and plasma was stored at −80 °C for further analysis, as described previously. We used an ELISA kit to measure plasma zonulin (Cat #K5601, Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used ELISA kits to measure plasma c-reactive proteins (CRP) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), 8–isoprostanes (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and creatine kinase, as described previously.\nStatistical analysis\nA one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc test was used to compare the differences among the groups. We used simple linear regression to investigate the correlations of plasma zonulin with CRP, 8-isoprostanes, and creatine kinase. The diagnostic potentials of plasma zonulin in reduced balance was assessed by calculating the areas under the curve (AUC) using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Data are presented as mean and standard deviation, and the p-value <0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 (Graphstats technologies private limited, Bangalore 560,035, India)."

        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "Background\nGlobal prevalence and incidence of dementia continue to rise at a rapid rate. There is a need for new Alzheimer’s disease (AD) treatments globally. Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated soluble amyloid beta oligomers and insoluble amyloid beta fibrils. In June 2021, aducanumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AD under the accelerated approval pathway.\nObjectives\nWe evaluated the efficacy, safety, biomarker and pharmacokinetics (PK) of aducanumab in Japanese subgroups in EMERGE and ENGAGE studies.\nDesign\nEMERGE and ENGAGE were two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, phase 3 studies of aducanumab in patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia).\nSetting\nThese studies involved 348 sites in 20 countries. PARTICIPANTS: Participants enrolled in Japan included 121 (7.4% of total 1638 in EMERGE) and 100 (6.1% of total 1647 in ENGAGE) patients (aged 50–85 years with confirmed amyloid pathology) who met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia.\nIntervention\nParticipants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive aducanumab low dose (3 or 6 mg/kg target dose), high dose (6 or 10 mg/kg target dose) or placebo via IV infusion once every 4 weeks over 76 weeks.\nMeasurements\nThe primary outcome measure was change from baseline to Week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), an integrated scale that assesses both function and cognition. Other measures included safety assessments; secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes that assessed cognition, function, and behavior; biomarker endpoints (amyloid PET and plasma p-tau181); serum PK profiles and immunogenicity.\nResults\nResults from the Japanese subgroup analyses were generally consistent with those of the overall study population across endpoints, while a lower mean body weight (kg) and a smaller proportion of ApoE ε4 carriers were observed in the Japanese subgroup population. A treatment effect was observed in favor of aducanumab on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 78 in EMERGE, but not ENGAGE. The incidence and type of adverse events in the Japanese subgroups were generally comparable to those observed in the overall study population; amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were common treatment-related adverse events that appeared to be related to the aducanumab dose. ARIA incidence was generally lower in the Japanese subgroup compared with the overall population. Consistent with the overall data set, a robust dose-dependent decrease in amyloid beta levels as assessed with amyloid-PET and plasma p-tau181 was observed. Serum PK profiles and immunogenicity of aducanumab in Japanese population were consistent with the non-Japanese population.\nConclusion\nEfficacy, safety, biomarker, and PK profiles of aducanumab were consistent between the Japanese subgroup and the overall population. A positive treatment effect of aducanumab on efficacy endpoints was observed in EMERGE, but not in ENGAGE.\nElectronic Supplementary Material\nSupplementary material is available in the online version of this article at 10.14283/jpad.2024.106.",
            "Method": "Methods\nParticipants\nInclusion criteria for EMERGE and ENGAGE are listed. Briefly, EMERGE and ENGAGE included patients with early AD who 1) met clinical criteria for either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD dementia, 2) were aged 50 to 85 years, 3) had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)-Global score of 0.5, 4) had a Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) delayed memory index score ≤85, and 5) had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 24 and 30 (inclusive). Participants were confirmed to be amyloid positive via amyloid positron emission tomography (PET; central visual read). Participants in Japan were enrolled across 27 sites (EMERGE) and 18 sites (ENGAGE).\nClinical study design\nDetails have been previously published. Briefly, randomization was stratified by study site and by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 carrier status (carrier vs noncarrier). Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive low-dose aducanumab (3 mg/kg [ApoE ε4+] or 6 mg/kg [ApoE ε4−]), high-dose aducanumab (6 mg/kg [ApoE ε4+] or 10 mg/kg [ApoE ε4−]), or placebo via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. The implementation of protocol version 4 (PV4; approved on March 24, 2017) allowed ApoE ε4 carriers in the high-dose group to receive 10 mg/kg of aducanumab, which was an increase from 6 mg/kg pre-PV4. The treatment period for the Japanese study sites was from June 9, 2016, to July 31, 2019 (final follow-up visit) in EMERGE and from September 1, 2016, to July 31, 2019 (final follow-up visit) in ENGAGE.\nEfficacy assessments\nThe efficacy outcomes included the primary endpoint (change from baseline in CDR-Sum of Boxes [SB] at Week 78) and secondary endpoints (change from baseline in MMSE, Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale-13 items [ADAS-Cog13], and Activities of Daily Living Inventory-Mild Cognitive Impairment version [ADCS-ADL-MCI] scores at Week 78).\nSafety assessments\nA description of the safety assessments in EMERGE and ENGAGE, including methodology related to the monitoring, analyses, and management of amyloid related imaging abnormality (ARIA), have been reported. Briefly, the safety and tolerability of aducanumab were assessed via (1) monitoring incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); (2) assessing brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (e.g., the incidence of ARIA-edema [E] and ARIA-hemorrhage [H] comprised of microhemorrhages, macrohemorrhages, or superficial siderosis); (3) monitoring clinically significant abnormalities and changes in vital signs, (4) tracking Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale results, and (5) monitoring incidence of anti-aducanumab antibodies in serum throughout the study period.\nBiomarkers, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity\nCerebral amyloid plaque content was measured by amyloid PET imaging for eligibility and as part of a longitudinal biomarker substudy, as previously described. Images were collected at baseline, Week 26 and Week 78. Multiple radioligands for Aβ PET have been approved for the detection of amyloid. Globally, EMERGE and ENGAGE trial sites used the 18F-florbetapir radioligand for substudy imaging, however due to the its limited geographic availability in Japan at the start of the studies, the 18F-flutemetamol radioligand was also included. Both tracers have been approved for the detection of amyloid in Japan. The Centiloid Scale approach was used to transform Aβ PET composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) derived from each PET radioligand to a common scale to enable pooling of results. The formulas used were: 100×((SUVR-1.0124))/0.4339 for 18F-florbetapir and 100×((SUVR-0.9593))/0.6170 for 18F-flutemetamol.\nThe effects of aducanumab treatment on plasma p-tau181 levels were analyzed using the Quanterix Simoa p-tau181 Advantage V2 kit at Frontage Laboratories’ (Exton, PA) CLIA laboratory. Data were captured by the Quanterix Simoa HD-X Analyzer as previously described. Serum PK profiles and immunogenicity of aducanumab were measured throughout the study using a validated assay.\nOversight\nEMERGE and ENGAGE were carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and the International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guideline (ICH-GCP). The studies were approved by ethics committees or institutional review boards at each participating site in Japan. All patients provided written informed consent. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed ongoing safety and tolerability data throughout the course of the studies and reviewed futility analysis results.\nStatistical analyses\nPrimary analyses on the primary, secondary, and amyloid PET endpoints for the Japanese subgroup were performed following the same prespecified mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) used for the overall population, except for the exclusion of region as a covariate. Forest plots of the efficacy results were presented to evaluate the consistency of the Japanese efficacy results with those of the overall population. Incidence was calculated by treatment group for AEs and SAEs in the Japanese subgroup. The statistical software, SAS®, was used for all summaries and analyses.\nAvailability of data and materials\nWhile the data described in this article are not publicly available, the authors and Biogen are supportive of data sharing.

            "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION.\nPlasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (P-tau217) and neurofilament light (NfL) have emerged as markers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Few studies have examined the role of sex in plasma biomarkers in sporadic AD, yielding mixed findings, and none in autosomal dominant AD.\nMETHODS.\nWe examined the effects of sex and age on plasma P-tau217 and NfL, and their association with cognitive performance in a cross-sectional study of 621 Presenilin-1 E280A mutation carriers and non-carriers.\nRESULTS.\nAs plasma P-tau217 levels increase, cognitively unimpaired female carriers showed better cognitive performance than cognitively unimpaired male carriers. Yet, as disease progresses, female carriers had a greater plasma NfL increase than male carriers. There were no sex differences in the association between age and plasma biomarkers among non-carriers.\nDISCUSSION.\nOur findings suggest that, among PSEN1 mutation carriers, females had a greater rate of neurodegeneration than males, yet it did not predict cognitive performance.",
            "Method": "Methods\nParticipants & Procedures\nA total of 621 participants were included in the study, including 259 cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers (mean age: 31, range 24-39; %male: 45.6), 106 cognitively impaired mutation carriers (mean age: 49, range 46-52; %male: 45.3), and 256 age- and sex-matched, cognitively unimpaired non-carriers from the same kindred (mean age: 34, range 25.3-42; %male: 39.5) who were enrolled from December 2013 to February 2017 in the Colombian Alzheimer Prevention Initiative (API) Registry. In brief, this registry aims to locate, enroll, genotype, and perform medical and cognitive evaluations of PSEN1 E280A family members, and includes individuals with early-onset, potentially familial AD and healthy relatives, age 8 and older. Only those who were 18 years old or above were included in the present study.\nNearly all PSEN1 mutation carriers develop early-onset AD, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) symptoms emerging at a median age of 44 years and dementia at 49 years. Participants were considered cognitively unimpaired if they had a MMSE score ≥26 points, a functional assessment staging test (FAST) score ≤2, and no cognitive impairment on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) battery. Cognitive impairment was defined as a FAST score of ≥3 or MCI or dementia due to AD. Clinical diagnoses were determined by an interdisciplinary team of dementia specialists (i.e., neurologists, neuropsychologists). Individuals with significant medical, psychiatric, or neurological disorders were excluded. Participants in the study reported their sex assigned at birth (i.e., male/female).\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Antioquia, Colombia, including procedures undertaken outside the University of Antioquia. Informed written consent for participation and the use of data and samples was obtained from cognitively unimpaired adult participants, or from a legal representative (i.e., partner or offspring) of cognitively impaired participants. Participants included a representative sample from the region of Antioquia, Colombia. Participants were not excluded in the basis of sex, gender, race or ethnicity. Participants and investigators acquiring and analyzing data were blind to genetic status. All participants completed clinical and cognitive assessments, and blood samples were collected within 6 months of cognitive evaluations as part of the registry procedures.\nPlasma Sampling\nPlasma was collected in the morning (without fasting) at the University of Antioquia. Three aliquots of 1 mL were collected. Samples were centrifuged, stored at −80°C and shipped on dry ice for analysis. Plasma NfL concentration was measured at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, using the NF-Light kit on a Single molecule array (Simoa) HD-X Analyzer (Quanterix, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described. Measurements were done by board-certified laboratory technicians. Calibrators were run in duplicates, and obvious outlier calibrator replicates were masked before curve fitting. Samples were diluted four-fold and run in singlicates. All measurements were made without information on any clinical data. The dynamic range of the assay was 1.9–1800 pg/mL. Two QC plasma samples were run in duplicates in the beginning and the end of each run. For the QC sample with a concentration of 10.8 pg/mL, repeatability was 4.8% and intermediate precision 6.2%, while for the QC sample with a concentration of 47.7 pg/mL, repeatability was 3.3% and intermediate precision 4.6%. One batch of reagents and one instrument was used to analyze all samples.\nFor P-tau217, concentrations of plasma P-tau217 were measured using immunoassays at Lilly Research Laboratories, using the MSD platform (Meso Scale Discovery), as previously described. Biotinylated-IBA493 was used as a capture antibody and SULFO-TAG-4G10-E2 (anti-Tau) as the detector. The assay was calibrated using a recombinant tau (4R2N) protein that was phosphorylated in vitro using a reaction with glycogen synthase kinase-3 and characterized by mass spectrometry. Additional details of the plasma P-tau217 analysis are described in Palmqvist et al., 2020, Supplemental Material. Plasma samples from study participants were analyzed in duplicates with a mean intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of 13.9%. The mean inter-assay CVs of quality control samples were 3.4-5.5%. The lower limit of detection of the plasma P-tau217 assay was 0.48 pg/mL.\nFor genetic analyses, genomic DNA was extracted from blood by standard protocols, and PSEN1 E280A characterization was done at the University of Antioquia using methods described previously. NfL analyses were supervised by co-authors Zetterberg and Blennow at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital (Sweden), and P-tau217 analyses by co-author Dage at Lilly Research Laboratories (USA).\nClinical & Cognitive Assessments\nClinical and cognitive assessments were undertaken at the University of Antioquia (Medellín, Colombia). Participants completed a battery of clinical and cognitive measures in Spanish, adapted by the Neurosciences Group of Antioquia (GNA) to characterize this Colombian population, including the MMSE, the Spanish CERAD battery, the Functional Assessment Staging Test, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Testing was done in Spanish by neuropsychologists or psychologists trained in neuropsychological assessment. We calculated the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative (API) global cognition composite score, which includes the MMSE (Orientation to Time), Boston Naming Test (15-item), Ravens Progressive Matrices (12-item), CERAD Word List (Delayed Recall), and Constructional Praxis (Copy). This cognitive composite score has been shown to track preclinical AD decline in autosomal dominant AD. Clinical histories and neurological examinations were completed by neurologists or physicians trained in assessing neurodegenerative disorders.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe compared demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and cognitive data among males and females stratified by PSEN1 mutation status (i.e., carriers and non-carriers) using t-tests. Because plasma P-tau217 and NfL data were not normally distributed, plasma biomarker data was log transformed. To examine the age-related trajectory of plasma biomarkers, a proxy for disease progression in this kindred, we used multiple linear regression models to estimate the effect of age, sex, and the interaction between sex and age on P-tau217 and NfL levels, stratified by PSEN1 mutation carriers and non-carriers. Bivariate local polynomial regressions (LOESS) were used to characterize relationships between log-transformed plasma P-tau217 and NfL with age. We then used multiple linear regressions to examine whether sex modified the relationship between plasma biomarkers and cognitive performance among PSEN1 carriers. Models included plasma biomarkers – P-tau217 and NfL – as the independent variable, cognitive measures – API cognitive composite score and CERAD word list delayed recall – as dependent variables, sex as a covariate of interest, and the interaction terms between sex and plasma biomarkers (i.e., Sex*P-tau217 and Sex*NfL). Subsequent models were run controlling for age. To further understand the effect of age, a proxy for disease progression among PSEN1 mutation carriers, secondary analyses were conducted stratifying by disease stage (i.e., cognitively unimpaired carriers and cognitively impaired carriers). Analyses used a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Analyses were performed by a team of biostatisticians who were unblinded to genotype but had no role in the study design or data collection. Statistical analyses were done using R (version 4.0.2, The R Foundation) and SPSS version 24. Of note, a female non-carrier participant had NfL values >2 standard deviations above the non-carrier mean and was removed from the analyses."

            "Abstract": "Background\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that early intervention was the best plan to inhibit the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which relied on the discovery of early diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) was examined to improve the early diagnostic efficiency in AD.\nMethods\nIn this study, biomarker testing was performed through the single-molecule array (Simoa). A total of 121 subjects including cognitively unimpaired controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), AD and other types of dementia underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SV2A testing; 430 subjects including health controls, aMCI, AD and other types of dementia underwent serum SV2A, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL) and p-tau217 testing; 92 subjects including aMCI and AD underwent both CSF SV2A and serum SV2A testing; 115 cognitively unimpaired subjects including APOE ε4 carriers and APOE ε4 non-carriers were tested for serum SV2A, GFAP, NfL and p-tau217. Then, the efficacy of SV2A for the early diagnosis of AD and its ability to identify those at high risk of AD from a cognitively unimpaired population were further analyzed.\nResults\nBoth CSF and serum SV2A significantly and positively correlated with cognitive performance in patients with AD, and their levels gradually decreased with the progression of AD. Serum SV2A demonstrated excellent diagnostic efficacy for aMCI, with a sensitivity of 97.8%, which was significantly higher than those of NfL, GFAP, and p-tau217. The SV2A-positive rates ranged from 92.86 to 100% in aMCI cases that were negative for the above three biomarkers. Importantly, of all the biomarkers tested, serum SV2A had the highest positivity rate (81.82%) in individuals at risk for AD.\nConclusions\nSerum SV2A was demonstrated to be a novel and ideal biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD, which can effectively distinguish those at high risk of AD in cognitively unimpaired populations.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13195-024-01440-9.",
            "Method": "Methods\nStudy participants\nA total of 757 participants were recruited from September 2021 to February 2024. The diagnoses of AD was made according to the criteria published by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA), which combined with brain MRI or/and PET-Aβ or/and PET-tau. aMCI was diagnosed by the criteria as described previously. Briefly, (I) cognitive impairment is detected by the patients themselves, their families, or experienced clinicians; (II) cognitive assessment reveals the presence of impairment in one or more domains of cognitive functioning; (III) complex instrumental daily living of patients can be mildly impaired but independent daily living is maintained; (IV) criteria for the diagnosis of dementia has not been met. VaD and PDD was diagnosed based on previously published criteria. All clinical diagnoses were first time diagnoses and were made by experienced physicians of Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University.\nThe exclusion criteria for the patients was as follows: (I) patients with traumatic brain disorders and other psychiatric disorders; (II) patients with systemic diseases such as tumors, blood diseases, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The inclusion criteria for the healthy controls for blood tests was as follows: (I) age-matched participants who have undergone medical examination at the Health Examination Center of Xuanwu Hospital, and (II) the results of the physical examination confirmed that the participants had no neurological diseases, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and other systemic diseases. The inclusion criteria for the participants in the control group who underwent CSF testing was as follows: (I) participants who were hospitalized for the first time and did not receive systemic therapy, (II) did not have imaging findings of cognitive impairment such as hippocampal atrophy, (III) and at least two neurologists confirmed that they did not have clinical manifestations of cognitive impairment.\nIn total, 59 individuals were excluded, and 698 were finally included in the study. The sera of 430 participants comprising the healthy control (n = 102), aMCI (n = 91), AD (n = 164), VaD (n = 43), and PDD (n = 30) groups were investigated. The CSF samples of 121 patients comprising the normal cognition group (n = 35), aMCI (n = 14), AD (n = 46), VaD (n = 13), and PDD (n = 13) were also analyzed. Of these, a total of 8 patients with aMCI and 22 with AD had their CSF and venous blood samples collected simultaneously and then tested for SV2A, and we collected CSF and serum samples from an additional 29 aMCI and 33 AD patients simultaneously for correlation analysis between CSF SV2A and serum SV2A. In addition, the sera of 115 participants with unimpaired cognition, including apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (n = 55) and non-carriers (n = 60), were examined. The subject inclusion and exclusion process is shown in Fig. 1. No statistically significant difference in age was found between the dementia groups and the control group, and between APOE ε4 carriers and APOE ε4 non-carriers. The sex ratio of each dementia group matched that of the control group, except for the VaD group that had undergone blood testing. Clinical and demographic features of the diagnostic cohorts are shown in Table 1.\nCSF and serum collection\nCSF samples were immediately collected according to international guidelines. Briefly, the participants were placed in the left lateral position for lumbar puncture. The L3–L5 intervertebral disc spaces were chosen as the puncture site. CSF samples were collected with 20-gauge atraumatic needles and centrifugated at 2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nBlood samples were drawn by venipuncture in the morning after a 12-h fast and were kept in serum tubes with a clot activator. Sera were extracted from the blood samples by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. CSF and serum samples were then stored in polypropylene tubes at − 80℃ until the next test, avoiding repeated freezing and thawing.\nGenetic analyses\nGenomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples using a salting-out procedure. APOE genotypes were determined by Sanger sequencing, and the primers used were as follows: forward—AGACGCGGGCACGGCTGTCCAAGGA; reverse—AGACGCGGGCACGGCTGTCCAAGGA.\nSimoa assay for CSF and serum analysis\nFor the novel SV2A Simoa assay, a polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing SV2A was used (CSB-PA022978LA01HU, CUSABIO, Wuhan, China) as capture antibody, with identifying sequence of 36-149AA. Another rabbit Anti-SV2A antibody (bs-2407R, BIOSS, Beijing, China) was used as a detection antibody with a recognition site of 451–550. CSF and serum samples were analyzed on the AST-Sc-Lite, a fully-auto single-molecule detection machine (Suzhou AstraBio Technology Co., Ltd., China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. GFAP and NfL were detected as described in the previously published study. Briefly, the working steps were as follows: (I) load 25 µL of the sample into an incubation tube and add reagent 1 (mainly comprised of 0.1 mg/mL magnetic beads coated with capture antibodies and protecting reagents), followed by a quick mixing by the machine. (II) After 6 min of incubation, reagent 2 (mainly comprised of the detection antibodies labeled with single-molecule imagine fluorophores supplied by AstraBio) was added, mixed, and incubated for 4 min at 40 °C. (III) The magnetic beads in the mixtures were absorbed onto the surface of the channel in the flow cell by a permanent magnet. Unlabeled fluorophores were removed by gentle washing flow of the wash buffer, and fluorescent images were then taken with an integrated fluorescent microscope. (IV) The single-molecule signals were analyzed by the machine, and protein concentrations were calculated using a build standard curve prepared in advance. The standard curves for each biomarker were shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1. The new SV2A simoa assay as well as the GFAP, NfL and p-tau217 simoa assays demonstrated excellent detection performance, and more information was presented in Additional file 1.\nStereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)\nAs for the construction of AAV9-SV2Aoe, the vector HBAAV9-m-3xflag-T2A-mcherry (Hanbio Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was used. 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice prepared for the stereotaxic injection were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. The AAV9 were bilaterally injected into the dorsal hippocampal area at a rate of 0.2 µL/min, and the total volumes of AAV-SV2Aoe (1.3 × 1012 vg/mL) and AAV-Con (1.9 × 1012 vg/mL) injected into the unilateral hippocampal region were 1.5 µL and 1.0 µL, respectively. The needle was retracted after 10 min, and the wound was sutured after another 10 min.\nHistology and immunostaining\n4% paraformaldehyde-fixed mice brain tissues were dehydrated in 30% sucrose and embedded in the optimal cutting temperature compound for frozen sectioning. Antigen retrieval was performed by using citric acid (pH 6.0) antigen repair solution in a sub-boiling temperature. Then sections were immersed in 3% hydrogenperoxide to block the endogenous peroxidase activity followed by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin solution to block non-specific binding. The slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a wet box with rabbit anti-6E10 (Cat. No. 803,015, BioLegend, USA, 1:1000). HRP-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Cat. No. GB23303, Servicebio, China, 1:500) were applied for 50 min at room temperature in dark condition, and antigen was visualized using tyramide signal amplification kits (Cat. No. G1226, Servicebio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sections were imaged using a slide scanner (PANNORAMIC, 3D HISTECH, Hungary). Images were then analyzed by Image J software, and the background was subtracted by the software for fluorescence images before quantification. The number and the size of Aβ plaques, and the fluorescence intensity of 6E10 in three brain sections containing the hippocampus and cortex of each mouse were measured.\nELISA\nThe blood of mice was collected into polypropylene tubes by the eyeball blood sampling method, left at room temperature for 2 h, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm/min for 20 min, and the supernatant was aspirated into new polypropylene tubes and stored at -80 °C to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. Levels of Aβ40 (Cat. No. EM0863, FineTest, Wuhan, China) and Aβ42 (Cat. No. EM0864, FineTest, Wuhan, China) were measured by ELISA following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nStatistical analysis\nThe normality of the distribution of the variables was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous variables were compared between two independent samples using the t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and representative optimal sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Cutoff levels were determined by maximizing the Youden index (sensitivity + specifcity − 1). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive models, and ROC curves were constructed from the logistic scores. Logistic regression models were employed to compare continuous variables between different groups before and after adjusting for covariates such as age and sex. Partial correlation analyses or Spearman’s rank correlation analyses were performed to assess the correlations between biomarkers, demographic characteristics, and clinical data. The statistical significance of the difference in the areas under the curve (AUCs) between two different models was analyzed using Delong’s test. The parallel test and serial test were used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the combined diagnostic models, respectively. All tests were two-tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and MedCalc version 20.0.22. Data were visualized using Prism 9 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA)."

            "Abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nImplementing a health system-based hypertension programme may lower blood pressure (BP).\nMethods\nWe performed a randomized, controlled pilot study to assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a home-based virtual hypertension programme integrating evidence-based strategies to overcome current barriers to BP control. Trained clinical pharmacists staffed the virtual collaborative care clinic (vCCC) to remotely manage hypertension using a BP dashboard and phone “visits” to monitor BP, adherence, side effects of medications, and prescribe anti-hypertensives. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension were identified via electronic health records. Enrolled patients were randomized to either vCCC or usual care for 3 months. We assessed patients’ home BP monitoring behaviour, and patients’, physicians’, and pharmacists’ perspectives on feasibility and acceptability of individual programme components.\nResults\nThirty-one patients (vCCC = 17, usual care = 14) from six physician clinics completed the pilot study. After 3 months, average BP decreased in the vCCC arm (P = 0.01), but not in the control arm (P = 0.45). The vCCC participants measured BP more (9.9 vs. 1.2 per week, P < 0.001). There were no intervention-related adverse events. Participating physicians (n = 6), pharmacists (n = 5), and patients (n = 31) rated all programme components with average scores of >4.0, a pre-specified benchmark. Nine adaptations in vCCC design and delivery were made based on potential barriers to implementing the programme and suggestions.\nConclusion\nA home-based virtual hypertension programme using team-based care, technology, and a logical integration of evidence-based strategies is safe, acceptable, and feasible to intended users. These pilot data support studies to assess the effectiveness of this programme at a larger scale.",
            "Method": "Methods\nWe conducted a pragmatic single-centre pilot study to assess critical implementation outcomes needed to scale up the hypertension programme (NCT04585880). The study was approved by the institutional review board.\nPatient identification and recruitment\nPatients aged ≥65 years with uncontrolled hypertension were enrolled from six PCP clinics for a 3-month duration. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as (i) SBP >140 mmHg at current visit and documented history of hypertension, (ii) SBP >140 mmHg at current visit and at another visit in the last 18 months, or (iii) SBP >160 mmHg at current visit. BP measured at an emergency department, inpatient, or surgical visit was not considered in determining eligibility as these readings are less likely to reflect usual BP control. We chose an age cut-off >65 years as it is the age of Medicare enrolment and several outcomes for the larger study will be obtained from the Medicare data. Moreover, the reduction in cardiovascular events from BP lowering is likely to be more evident in older individuals. Using these criteria our EHR Reporting Workbench (Epic Systems, Verona, WI) identified potentially eligible patients and referred them at the point of care (i.e. in real-time) to the study team for pre-screening and enrolment. We applied broad inclusion criteria to recruit men and women, all racial and ethnic minorities, patients with multiple comorbidities, frailty, mobility limitations, and very old adults who are often excluded from explanatory studies. Patients with illness that could affect the safety or study completion, such as unstable psychiatric disorder, mental retardation, or other reasons that make them unable to sign their own consent, end-stage kidney disease on dialysis, or expected life expectancy <2 years were excluded. The study was designed to be pragmatic (Supplementary Table 1) to allow transition to the real-world clinics. Clinical pharmacists from the PCP team delivered the intervention with flexible protocols. Phone visits reduced patient burden while continuing frequent contact. Potentially eligible patients were identified by the EHR. We used the EHR for initial patient identification. However, since all exclusion criteria couldn’t be done through the EHR, we had study coordinators screen and determine eligibility.\nPotentially eligible patients were contacted within 2 weeks of their primary care visit to determine eligibility. These eligibility criteria included access to a compatible smartphone or other devices, such as IOS, Android, or Amazon Kindle or Fire devices, sufficient fluency in English, adequate vision and hearing to complete study procedures, and interest). Informed consent was obtained remotely.\nIntervention\nAll participants received an FDA-approved electronic BP cuff (QardioArm, Qardio Inc.) and educational material on hypertension in preparation for the baseline visit. During the baseline visit, study coordinators instructed patients on use of the BP cuff and the correct method of BP measurement. After a 5-min rest, three standardized BP measures, 1 min apart were obtained. If a BP reading was different by ≥20 mmHg from other two readings, it was discarded, and a fourth reading was taken to replace it. A symptom checklist and patient surveys were also obtained.\nAfter the baseline visit, participants were randomized to either a control group (usual care with education) or the vCCC group (Supplementary Fig. 1). Randomization was done remotely. The study coordinator randomized the participant in the REDCap database (randomization prepared by the study statisticians) while the participant was still on the phone and provided them with instructions on how to proceed based on the study arm they were randomized to usual care with education or the virtual collaborative care clinic arm.\nVirtual collaborative care clinic\nThe vCCC operated as an extension (not replacement) of care provided by PCPs. Trained, board-certified, or board-eligible ambulatory care clinical pharmacists already working for the health system staffed the vCCC. The vCCC pharmacists managed hypertension. They educated patients on home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), monitored home BP readings, adherence, and medication side effects. They used the EHR to communicate with physicians, order laboratory tests, e-prescribe medications, or make medication changes. To monitor longitudinal home BP readings, vCCC pharmacists used a BP dashboard (Qardio Inc) and a patient portal (Epic MyChart) and/or phone calls to communicate with patients. The BP dashboard used a traffic light system to organize and prioritize uncontrolled BP and individualize BP goals and alerts. The vCCC pharmacists communicated at least once a month with patients and as often as required. If a patient did not check BP regularly, pharmacists contacted the patient to address barriers to adherence.\nFor patients randomized to the vCCC group, the vCCC pharmacist conducted a 15-min introductory phone call, reviewed current medications and BP history, and encouraged regular HBPM (at least 10 times a week, 5 in the morning and 5 in the evening). The control group was not contacted by the vCCC and continued regular follow-up with their physicians.\nThe primary outcomes were programme feasibility and acceptability. Other outcomes included barrier and facilitator identification, safety, frequency of HBPM, and change in BP. Acceptability and feasibility of the programme were evaluated by assessing five programme components: automated referral, HBPM, pharmacist management, physician involvement, and the BP cuff. Only patients randomized to the vCCC rated pharmacist management and automated referral. Validated, 4-item scales: the Acceptability of Intervention Measure and the Feasibility of Intervention Measure were used. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. A minimum threshold of 4.0 on the Acceptability and Feasibility scales was established a priori to demonstrate acceptability and feasibility, a lower bound used in other intervention assessments. Surveys included open-ended items. Patients evaluated programme components at the end-of-study visit while physicians and pharmacists evaluated them before enrolment and at 3 months after enrolment of the first patient. We used the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Disease (TICD) framework for determinant evaluation. Like other determinant frameworks, the TICD assesses motivational, organizational, and capability domains, but also includes attributes of the intervention and focuses on guideline-based clinical care delivery. Safety was assessed by comparing the symptom checklists obtained at baseline and 3 months and reporting any new symptom or event as an adverse event. Frequencies of HBPM and home BP readings were monitored through the Qardio app.\nData collection\nBP readings were obtained through the Qardio app. Demographic information (age, sex, race, and ethnicity), medical history (heart rate, BMI, and comorbidities), anti-hypertensive medications, laboratory values, and clinic-measured BP were obtained from the EHR. The number of anti-hypertensive medications per drug class was summarized. Survey ratings were collected via a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) electronic survey delivered by email. Study coordinators administered the surveys via telephone to any patients who did not complete the survey electronically.\nPhysician advisory board\nWe selected respected, experienced clinical leaders in the Departments of Internal Medicine and Family Medicine with credibility, commitment to BP control, quality improvement skills, and institutional linkages to participate in the pilot study. The physician advisory board (PAB) was initiated prior to patient enrolment and met monthly for the study duration. The PAB discussed study design, feedback from stakeholders, and potential adaptations to the programme in structured focus groups.\nWe conducted semi-structured interviews of participating pharmacists to optimize the intervention components and identify potential barriers and facilitators to implementation. Two pharmacists with greatest experience using vCCC were selected to provide in-depth feedback. Both physician and pharmacist interviews were conducted by an experienced interviewer (SDE) via Zoom. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.\nAnalysis\nDescriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations) were calculated for baseline characteristics, including baseline demographics, medical history, use of anti-hypertensive medications, and laboratory results. Descriptive statistics were also calculated for home BP readings at baseline and 12 weeks and change in BP from baseline. Mean BP values at baseline and 12 weeks within each treatment arm were compared with paired t-tests. Additionally, the differences in the average weekly number of BP readings between the two treatment arms were compared using a t-test. For the acceptability and feasibility measures, summary scores were calculated for each treatment arm using the average of the responses within each survey component and compared using t-tests (patient scores) and paired t-tests (provider scores).\nQualitative data were coded using a combination of inductive coding and template analysis. One coder identified emerging themes among patient open-ended survey item responses and compared themes between patients randomized to the vCCC versus usual care. Qualitative data collected from pharmacists and physicians were coded to TICD domains. Data were combined, and barriers were assessed for potential intervention or study execution changes. Coded themes were reviewed by a second investigator and revised until consensus was reached. Potential changes were reported to the study team and evaluated for salience by the PAB before adaptations were made, resulting in a set of key recommendations for action.\nWe adapted procedures so that all study operations, including recruitment, study visits, vCCC visits, PAB, and investigator meetings were done remotely for the safety of the patients, providers, and study staff during the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "Abstract": "Abstract\nINTRODUCTION\nLecanemab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (protofibrils) with activity at amyloid plaques. Amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) profiles appear to differ for various anti‐amyloid antibodies. Here, we present ARIA data from a large phase 2 lecanemab trial (Study 201) in early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nStudy 201 trial was double‐blind, placebo‐controlled (core) with an open‐label extension (OLE). Observed ARIA events were summarized and modeled via Kaplan‐Meier graphs. An exposure response model was developed.\nRESULTS\nIn the phase 2 core and OLE, there was a low incidence of ARIA‐E (<10%), with <3% symptomatic cases. ARIA‐E was generally asymptomatic, mild‐to‐moderate in severity, and occurred early (<3 months). ARIA‐E was correlated with maximum lecanemab serum concentration and incidence was higher in apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) homozygous carriers. ARIA‐H and ARIA‐E occurred with similar frequency in core and OLE.\nDISCUSSION\nLecanemab can be administered without titration with modest incidence of ARIA.",
            "Method": "METHODS\nStudy design and treatments\nStudy 201 core\nThe lecanemab Study 201 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01767311) was a multinational, multicenter, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study employing response adaptive randomization. Details of the study design have been previously published and brief description of relevant methods can be found in the supplement.\n201 open‐label extension\nThe OLE was initiated following analysis of the core phase 2b Study 201 to allow subjects to receive open‐label lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly for up to 24 months to assess long‐term safety and tolerability. All subjects who fulfilled OLE inclusion/exclusion criteria and entered the OLE received 10 mg/kg biweekly during the OLE period, regardless of ApoE genotype. Since the OLE was added in an amendment to Study 201 after completion of the core study, there was a gap period between the end of the Study 201 core and OLE baseline when no treatment was provided, which was 9–59 months (mean and median: approximately 24 months). MRI was conducted to monitor for ARIA at 9 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months over the first 12 months of 10 mg/kg biweekly lecanemab treatment in the OLE (i.e., identical to the core phase of Study 201 in the first 12 months). After 12 months, MRI was conducted every 6 months. ARIA‐E and ARIA‐H data were summarized according to observed events in the longitudinal OLE period. In contrast to the core study where all cases of ARIA‐E were discontinued, ARIA management in the OLE allowed for uninterrupted dosing in radiographically mild or moderate asymptomatic cases of ARIA‐E, while dosing was interrupted for radiographically severe events, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, until resolution or stabilization, at which time resumption of treatment was permitted. ARIA‐E was best detected with the 2D‐T2FLAIR sequence used and ARIA‐H was best detected with the T2* sequence. Subjects who developed symptomatic ARIA‐H were also temporarily stopped from study drug administration. Subjects had safety visits (with MRI) at approximately 30 days after event was identified until ARIA resolved, at which time treatment could be resumed.\nExposure response analysis for safety (ARIA‐E)\nARIA‐E incidence was correlated with lecanemab maximum concentration at steady state (Css,max) using logistic regression analysis data from Study 201 across all dosing regimens. Covariates included age, gender, ApoE4 carrier genotype status, ongoing treatment with AChEIs and/or memantine, and clinical subgroup (MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia). Time‐to‐event (TTE) analysis was performed for time to the first observation of ARIA‐E. Parametric TTE model was constructed by linking an event time and drug exposure through hazard function. ARIA‐E event rate was attenuated over time and log‐hazard model was used as a base model."

            "Method": "METHODS\nParticipants and Sample Collection\nFive cognitively normal amyloid-negative participants aged 30–60 underwent both sleep-deprived and normal sleep conditions in a cross-over design study. As previously reported, all participants reported no clinical sleep disorders or subjective daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scores [1 participant did not complete): mean=3.75, standard deviation (SD)=2.99, range=1–8) and were screened to exclude sleep-disordered breathing with a home sleep apnea test (all with Respiratory Event Index <5). Participants were either assigned normal control or sleep-deprived conditions, and then returned ~4–6 months later on average for cross-over to the other condition. Three participants completed the control condition followed by sleep deprivation, and two participants completed sleep deprivation followed by control. Participant characteristics are listed in Table 1. The effect of sleep deprivation in these participants on CSF Aβ, tau, and p-tau were previously reported. The study protocol was approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board and an independent safety committee oversaw the entire study with regular review of adverse events and approval to continue. All participants completed written informed consent and were compensated for their participation in the study.\nVenous and lumbar catheters were placed at ~7:00 a.m. on the first day. CSF and plasma were obtained every 2 hours for 36 hours. All CSF samples were collected and processed as previously described. Blood was drawn into EDTA K2 containing Tube (BD 368589). The tubes were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Then, plasma samples were aliquoted with 1 ml volumes and frozen by dry ice and later stored at −80 °C.\nMeasurement of CSF and Plasma Aβ and Tau\nCSF Aβ and tau were measured by immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) as previously described. We conducted the plasma Aβ IP LC/MS as reported except all handling processes were performed by Hamilton Microlab STAR Liquid Handling System (Hamilton, NV, U.S.A) in an automated processing method. Human plasma tau separation was performed as previously described with modifications. Frozen plasma aliquots of 1 ml were thawed at room temperature and centrifuged at 21,130 g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Plasma samples were spiked with 2.5 ng of 15N-labeled recombinant 2N4R tau internal standard (gift from Guy Lippens, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite de Lille, Villeneuve-d’Ascq, France) with a mixture of 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1% NP-40, and 5 mM guanidine and then immunoprecipitated with 20 μl Tau1 antibody cross-linked to sepharose beads at 4°C overnight. The pelleted sepharose beads were washed with 25 mM TEABC and then the sample was extracted with 200 μL 0.1% TFA. The extracted samples were loaded on an Oasis HLB 96-well μElution plate 30 μm, 2 mg Sorbent per well (Waters) conditioned with 200 μl MeOH and 200 μl 0.1% TFA. After loading, samples were desalted with 200 μl 0.1% TFA and then eluted with 100 μl 27.5% acetonitrile-0.1% TFA solution. After drying, absolute quantitation peptides (Life Technologies) to 5 and 0.5 fmol for each unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptide were added to the samples for quantitation and then digested with 400 ng trypsin in 25mM TEABC for 16 hours. Finally, samples were purified by solid phase extraction on C18 TopTips (Glygen) and desalted and eluted with 100 μl 60% ACN, 0.1% FA. The eluate was lyophilized and resuspended in 12.5 μl 2% ACN, 0.1% FA before nano-LC-MS/high-resolution MS analysis by using nanoAcquity ultra performance LC system (Waters) coupled to an Orbitrap Tribrid Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating as reported. Skyline software (MacCoss Lab, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) was used to extract the LC-MS data.\nMeasurement of CSF/Plasma Albumin Ratio\nCSF albumin and plasma albumin were quantified by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the kit instructions. CSF and plasma from all time points of each participant were run in duplicate on the same ELISA plate.\nStatistics Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 28 (IBM, Armonk, NY). All serial CSF and plasma Aβ and tau data were analyzed with general linear mixed models in order to account for the dependences of the longitudinal measurements. Comparisons were made between conditions with individual within-participant data and not group averaged data. Intervention group and time of day were treated as fixed effects. Random intercepts and slopes for time were used to accommodate individual variation. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to compare covariance structures and compound symmetry was selected as the best fit. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The normality assumption was verified through residual plots."

            "Abstract": "Abstract\nINTRODUCTION\nThe “A/T/N” (amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration) framework provides a biological basis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and can encompass additional changes such as inflammation (“I”). A spectrum of T/N/I imaging and plasma biomarkers was acquired in a phase 2 clinical trial of rasagiline in mild to moderate AD patients. We evaluated these to understand biomarker distributions and relationships within this population.\nMETHODS\nPlasma biomarkers of pTau‐181, neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), other inflammation‐related proteins, imaging measures including fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), flortaucipir PET, and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive endpoints were analyzed to assess characteristics and relationships for the overall population (N = 47 at baseline and N = 21 for longitudinal cognitive comparisons) and within age‐decade subgroups (57‐69, 70‐79, 80‐90 years).\nRESULTS\nData demonstrate wide clinical and biomarker heterogeneity in this population influenced by age and sex. Plasma pTau‐181 and GFAP correlate with tau PET, most strongly in left inferior temporal cortex (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0006, respectively). In regions beyond temporal cortex, tau PET uptake decreased with age for the same pTau‐181 or GFAP concentrations. FDG PET and brain volumes correlate with tau PET in numerous regions (such as inferior temporal: p = 0.0007, p = 0.00001, respectively). NfL, GFAP, and all imaging modalities correlate with baseline MMSE; subsequent MMSE decline is predicted by baseline parahippocampal and lateral temporal tau PET (p = 0.0007) and volume (p = 0.0006). Lateral temporal FDG PET (p = 0.006) and volume (p = 0.0001) are most strongly associated with subsequent ADAS‐cog decline. NfL correlates with FDG PET and baseline MMSE but not tau PET. Inflammation biomarkers are intercorrelated but correlated with other biomarkers in only the youngest group.\nDISCUSSION\nAssociations between plasma biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, and cognitive status observed in this study provide insight into relationships among biological processes in mild to moderate AD. Findings show the potential to characterize AD patients regarding likely tau pathology, neurodegeneration, prospective clinical decline, and the importance of covariates such as age.\nHighlights\nPlasma pTau‐181 and GFAP correlated with regional and global tau PET in mild to moderate AD.\nNfL correlated with FDG PET and cognitive endpoints but not plasma pTau‐181 or tau PET.\nVolume and FDG PET showed strong relationships to tau PET, one another, and cognitive status.\nTemporal volumes most strongly predicted decline in both MMSE and ADAS‐cog.\nVolume and plasma biomarkers can enrich for elevated tau PET with age a significant covariate.",
            "Method": "METHODS\nRasagiline study design\nFDG and tau PET imaging, MRI, plasma biomarkers, and clinical endpoints (Table 1) were acquired from patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate AD who participated in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of rasagiline (results described previously). Data were acquired under Institutional Review Board approval with informed patient consent at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Nevada and two Cleveland Clinic sites in Ohio. Primary inclusion criteria in the original study were a clinical diagnosis of probable AD (NINDS‐ADRDA criteria), age 50‐90, Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) 12‐26, and FDG PET pattern of hypometabolism consistent with AD. Exclusion criteria included neurologic, radiologic, or laboratory indications of non‐AD dementia; medications that might interact with rasagiline; and factors that might preclude study completion. Patients on stable doses of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for at least 3 months prior to randomization were permitted.\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT\n Systematic review: The authors performed an extensive review of the literature using PubMed, additional internet searches, and conference abstracts and presentations in order to develop hypotheses and to compare the findings of this study to other published findings. Prior relevant publications are cited.\n Interpretation: Our findings demonstrated significant relationships among plasma biomarkers, imaging measures, and cognitive status. Data also illustrated the heterogeneity present in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) populations and covariate influences to be considered when designing clinical trials or using plasma and imaging biomarkers to predict tau positron emission tomography (PET) levels for patient selection and analysis.\n Future directions: Future work would involve (a) confirmation in a larger study toward use in patient characterization for clinical trials and care, (b) work toward reducing variability in plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation, and (c) further establishment of normative references for plasma biomarkers.\nOf 96 patients screened, 50 patients, randomized 1:1 rasagiline to placebo, were enrolled. Our analyses used baseline data from all participants for cross‐sectional comparisons and from placebo‐treated participants to explore relationships to cognitive change. After excluding those with missing plasma biomarker data and follow‐up data (for longitudinal analyses), our analyses included 47 participants at baseline and 21 placebo‐treated participants for longitudinal comparisons.\nData acquisition and measurement\nClinical endpoints acquired at screening or baseline and at timepoints up to 26 weeks included MMSE, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS‐cog), Digit Span, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Volumetric MR (T1‐weighted) images were acquired at screening, FDG PET at screening and 24 weeks, and flortaucipir PET images at baseline and 24 weeks. Plasma pTau‐181, NfL, and GFAP were collected at baseline and at week 24; a 48‐plex panel of inflammatory biomarkers was collected at baseline (methods in Supplement).\nAnalyses\nBaseline characterization\nBaseline demographic, cognitive, imaging, and plasma biomarker distributions were characterized for the study population and three decade‐based age subgroups (57‐69, 70‐79, 80‐90 years; see Supplement). Tau PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) referenced to cerebellar cortex (eroded to reduce spill‐in) were measured in a MetaTemporal composite, Braak stage composites, total cortex, and individual regions. FDG PET and brain volumes were measured in the same regions as tau PET, including regions known to exhibit progressive hypometabolism and atrophy in AD.\nTau PET and FDG PET measures were adjusted for normal aging using data acquired using the same tracers and protocols in amyloid‐negative cognitively unimpaired individuals as previously described. Volumetric measures were adjusted for intracranial volume, age, sex, and scanner using a normative reference of amyloid‐negative cognitively unimpaired individuals as implemented in ADM Diagnostics’ CorInsights MRI® software. Plasma pTau‐181, NfL, and GFAP were adjusted for normal aging using slopes derived from amyloid‐negative cognitively impaired individuals in published studies using the same assays. Normative aging data were not available for inflammatory biomarkers (Supplement).\nRelationships between biomarkers\nInter‐region tau PET relationships were first examined as influenced by age and other covariates, focusing on relationships with inferior temporal cortex as it is an early region of NFT spread, used in criteria for clinical trial participation. To test our predefined hypotheses in this primarily tau PET+ (98%) population, we examined relationships between (a) plasma pTau‐181 and tau PET by region and cortical average, (b) plasma NfL and FDG PET in AD‐associated regions (medial temporal, lateral temporal, isthmus cingulate, inferior parietal, middle frontal), and (c) all biomarkers versus cognitive endpoints at baseline and 24‐week change. We similarly evaluated relationships between tau PET and NfL, GFAP, FDG PET, brain volumes, and combined plasma and FDG PET or volumetric biomarkers. As part of these investigations, we compared left‐right hemispheric imaging asymmetries as these ratios remove reference region effects, reducing technical variability.\nThe above relationships were evaluated using model fitting (standard least squares) in JMP v16 statistical software (SAS). Distributions were examined for normality and variables not meeting this condition (Shapiro‐Wilk and Anderson‐Darling tests, significance p < 0.05) were log10 transformed (all plasma variables were transformed). Covariates of age, sex, APOE genotype; education for cognitive endpoint comparisons; and cognitive baseline values when evaluating 24‐week cognitive change were included in models when significant or trend level. Models were also evaluated within each age decade to minimize age effects (particularly for inflammatory markers where normal aging data were not available) and age correction effects. Nonlinear models and variable interactions were also investigated. Pearson correlation was applied except for non‐normal distributions or group sizes below fifteen, where Spearman's Rank Order (rho) or nonparametric Wilcoxon tests were used. Given the exploratory nature of this work, numerous comparisons were made and significance was considered p < 0.05, uncorrected for multiple comparisons; p‐values <0.0001 are likely candidates to survive Bonferroni correction. To further illustrate relationship patterns among the imaging biomarkers, we derived voxel‐based multivariate machine learning classifiers as described and shown in the Supplement.\nFor cross‐correlation heat maps, plasma variables with a coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) greater than 20% after log10 transformation were excluded. Spearman's Rank Order (rho) correlation was used to generate the younger and oldest age group maps due to their lower subject numbers.\nWe also examined whether pTau‐181 could have been used as a screen for tau PET positivity. Participants were considered tau PET+ if their bilateral MetaTemporal SUVR (without partial volume correction) exceeded 1.29 or other target region SUVRs were positive. A cutoff was estimated as the value above which all tau PET+ scans were found and compared to values reported for A‐ and A+ MCI subjects in a study using the same assay. "

            "Abstract": "Background\nAlemtuzumab (ALZ) is a pulsed immune reconstitution therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS).\nObjective\nTo assess basic characteristics, therapeutic effects, and prognostic biomarkers on clinical and imaging parameters of disease activity for relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) patients selected for ALZ, in a real-world long-term setting.\nMethods\nFifty-one RRMS patients [female = 31; mean age 36 (standard deviation 7.1) years; median expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 2 (interquartile range (IQR) 1.5)] initiating ALZ treatment, were consecutively included. Patients were assessed at baseline and thereafter annually for 5 years with clinical measures, symbol digit modality test (SDMT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), reflecting astrogliosis, and neurofilament light (NfL), reflecting axonal damage, were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples collected at baseline and after 2 years in CSF, and annually in serum. Control subjects were symptomatic controls (SCs, n = 27), who were examined at baseline and after 5 years without evidence of neurological disease.\nResults\nWhile the mean annualized relapse rate was significantly reduced from baseline at each year of follow-up, disability was essentially maintained at a median EDSS of 1.5 and IQR between 1.13 and 2.25. New MRI activity was recorded in 26 patients (53%) over 5 years. The proportion of patients who achieved no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3), 6-months confirmed disability worsening (CDW), and 6-months confirmed disability improvement (CDI) at 5 years were 33, 31, and 31%, respectively. The SDMT score was reduced for patients (p < 0.001), but unchanged for SCs. ALZ treatment did not change GFAP levels, whereas there was a significant decrease for RRMS patients in median CSF and serum NfL levels at follow-up [CSF month 24: 456 pg./mL (IQR 285.4) (p = 0.05); serum month 24: 6.7 pg/mL (IQR 4.7) (p < 0.01); serum month 60: 7.2 pg/mL (IQR 4.7) (p < 0.01)], compared to baseline [CSF: 1014 pg/mL (IQR 2832.5); serum 8.6 pg/mL (IQR 17.4)].\nConclusion\nIn this real-world mono-center population, we observed a progression-free survival of 69%, cumulative NEDA-3 of 33%, and reduced NfL levels, over a five-year follow-up. This confirms ALZ as an effective pulsed immune reconstitution therapy that significantly reduces neuro axonal loss, and therefore has the potential to reduce long-term neurological disability. ALZ did not appear to affect astrogliosis.",
            "Method": "Materials and methods\nPatients and controls\nRRMS patients, 18 years of age or more, fulfilling the 2017 revised McDonald diagnostic criteria of MS, were consecutively included in the study when they commenced ALZ treatment, at the MS Center, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, between July 2014 and May 2016. Eligible patients for ALZ treatment may have been previously untreated or treated with one or several DMTs. They should not have ongoing acute or chronic infection, severe cardiovascular disease, stroke, coagulation disorders or treatments that affected coagulation, and were not allowed to have other autoimmune diseases than MS. Age and sex matched symptomatic controls (SCs) were recruited from persons with symptoms suspected for MS, referred to the MS Center, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, between April 2014 and June 2016, and with negative diagnostic work-up. SCs were re-examined after five years. SCs were defined as having no history or signs of neurological disease, and no abnormal findings on imaging [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] or in the CSF analysis.\nTreatment\nPatients received 60 mg intravenous (iv) ALZ on five consecutive days, and after 12 months, a repeated dose of 36 mg iv over three consecutive days. New courses of 36 mg iv ALZ were administered at signs of new disease activity, i.e., relapse, and/or detection of new, enlarging or contrast-enhancing MRI lesions. Premedication with 1000 mg iv methylprednisolone, oral antihistamine, paracetamol, and omeprazole was given the first three days of ALZ infusions. In addition, patients received prophylactic anti-herpesvirus treatment with acyclovir 200 mg twice daily for one month.\nStudy design\nThis was a prospective mono-center observational study with a follow-up of five years. Patients were assessed at month 0 (baseline), 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 (Figure 1). Baseline was the date of initiating ALZ treatment. Patient baseline and follow-up outcomes were assessed by clinical evaluation of relapses, neurological examination with assessment of disability, cognitive test, MRI, CSF and serum concentrations of GFAP, and NfL. We also recorded the number of ALZ courses received per patient, durability of ALZ treatment, the proportion of patients who switched to another DMT, and adverse events.\nClinical outcome measures\nIf new neurological symptoms appeared, or if old symptoms returned, for a period of 24 h or more, and no infection or raised core body temperature were present, this was categorized as a clinical relapse. Clinical activity was measured with the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Disability was assessed with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Confirmed disability worsening (CDW) was achieved if an increase in the EDSS score occurred, relative to baseline, and was confirmed over 6 months. The threshold levels of change in EDSS to achieve CDW were as follows: an increase to 1.5 from a baseline EDSS of 0, an increase of 1 point from a baseline of 1–5.0, and an increase of 0.5 from a baseline EDSS score ≥ 5.5. Confirmed disability improvement (CDI) was achieved if a decrease in EDSS score occurred, relative to baseline, and was sustained for 6 months or more. To achieve CDI there had to be a decrease in EDSS score of ≥1 point if baseline EDSS score was 2.0–5.5, or a decrease of ≥0.5 points if baseline score was ≥6.0. No evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3), was defined as absence of relapses, disability worsening, and new and/or enlarged T2 lesions, or gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI, while patients with either a relapse, MRI activity, or exacerbation of neurological disability, were considered as having evidence of disease activity-3 (EDA-3). Progression independent of relapses (PIRA) was defined as a 6-month CDW event with no previous or subsequent relapse during the five-year (60-month) follow-up period, whereas relapse associated worsening was defined as a 6-month CDW event with a previous relapse during follow-up.\nCognitive test\nCognition was assessed with symbol digit modality test (SDMT). To minimize learning bias a new version of SDMT was used at each time. We defined a clinically significant change in SDMT scores as an increase or decrease of eight or more raw score points from baseline, given that no reverse change in SDMT scores to less than in total eight points, compared with baseline, were observed during the following year. With a threshold of eight for SDMT, the following classification for RRMS patients were used: improvers (positive changes equal to or above the threshold level), maintainers (changes not reaching the threshold level) or decliners (negative changes equal to or above the threshold level).\nSafety\nThe common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE), Version 5.0, were used to grade adverse events. For early adverse events (<100 days after ALZ initiation), adverse events of grade 3 or higher were recorded. For late adverse events (>100 days after ALZ initiation) grade 2 or higher were recorded for autoimmune or infectious conditions, and grade 3 or higher for other adverse events.\nMRI\nBrain MRI according to Swedish guidelines in MS was performed, with a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner. We obtained T1- and T2-weighted sequences, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, and gadolinium-enhanced T1 sequences. In the major part of cases contrast-enhancement on MRI is visible during a period of 6 weeks, mean 3.07 weeks. To interrelate MRI measures, and CSF and serum biomarker concentrations, we therefore included MRI performed 6 weeks prior to or after lumbar puncture and blood sampling. We defined new disease activity on MRI as occurrence of a new contrast-enhancing lesion or new or enlarged T2 lesions, compared to preceding MRI.\nBiomarker analysis\nSamples of CSF were obtained at month 0 and 24, and serum samples from peripheral blood were obtained at month 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60. The consensus protocol of the BioMS-EU network for CSF biomarker research in MS was followed. In short CSF samples were collected and transferred to polypropylene tubes for centrifugation at 20°C, 2200 g for 10 min. Samples were then distributed into 1 mL aliquots in polypropylene vials, and permanently stored at −80°C pending analyses. Blood samples were collected, processed onsite to isolate serum, aliquoted, and frozen at −80°C. All biomarker analyses were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians in the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital. To account for potential variation between plates, baseline and follow-up samples were analyzed side-by-side on the same assay plate. All analyses were performed at room temperature.\nThe analyses of CSF and serum biomarkers (NfL, and GFAP) were performed using the Simoa® NEUROLOGY 2-PLEX B Kit, Product number: 103520, from Quanterix (Billerica, MA, USA). Briefly, the samples, quality control (QC) samples, with one QC high (within the higher measurement interval) and one QC low (within the lower measurement interval), and a set of pre-mixed calibrator samples (Product number: 103520, Quanterix, Billerica, MA, USA) were removed from storage and allowed to thaw at room temperature. The resorufin-D-galactopyranoside reagent was shaken for 30 min at 800 rpm and 30°C. The samples, QCs, and calibrators were vortexed for 30 s at 2000 rpm. The samples and QCs were thereafter centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 g. CSF samples were diluted 40x (10x pre-dilution +4x on-board), and serum samples 4x (on-board), both with sample dilution reagent. The samples, QCs, and calibrators were added to a Simoa plate, the calibrators right after a throughout mixing. The assay reagents and a Simoa plate with samples, QCs, and calibrators were loaded in a HD-1 Analyzer (Quanterix, Lexington, MA, USA), the beads after a throughout mixing for 30 s, and the measurements initiated. Intra- and inter assay coefficients of variation were below 10% for both QC high and QC low, for both GFAP and NfL. The functional Lower Limit of Quantification (fLLoQ) for serum GFAP and NfL was 29.4 pg/mL, respectively, 1.41 pg/mL. The fLLoQ for CSF was 10x the fLLoQ for serum. The CSF and serum samples of GFAP and NfL below the fLLoQ level were designated the value of fLLoQ.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistical analyses were used to analyze data. Continuous variables are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR), mean and standard deviation (SD), or mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). Categorical variables are expressed as the frequency and percentage. As the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric tests were used. Wilcoxon matched-pair singed-rank test was used to evaluate changes in continuous variables within groups, between two measured times. Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables between groups. Fischer’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables between groups. Cumulative probabilities of NEDA-3, CDW, and CDI were estimated with Kaplan–Meier curves. To assess the impact of baseline variables (age, gender, diagnosis duration, EDSS, and CSF NfL) on the outcomes of fulfilling EDA-3, CDW, and CDI at five-year follow-up, Kaplan–Meier survival analyses with corresponding log-rank tests were performed. For these analyses we used categorical nominal variables of age, diagnosis duration, EDSS, and CSF NfL. The cut-off for age (≤30 years) was based on previous reports regarding a significant change in the relationship between disability and onset age after about 30 years. Diagnosis duration was divided into three groups: ≤3 years, >3 to <10 years, and > 10 years, and EDSS into two groups: <3, and ≥ 3. The cut-off (>2136 pg/mL) for CSF NfL was based on calculation of the third of patients with the highest CSF NfL.

            "Abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease currently has no cure and is usually detected too late for interventions to be effective. In this study we have focused on cognitively normal subjects to study the impact of risk factors on their long-range brain connections. To detect vulnerable connections, we devised a multiscale, hierarchical method for spatial clustering of the whole brain tractogram and examined the impact of age and APOE allelic variation on cognitive abilities and bundle properties including texture e.g., mean fractional anisotropy, variability, and geometric properties including streamline length, volume, and shape, as well as asymmetry. We found that the third level subdivision in the bundle hierarchy provided the most sensitive ability to detect age and genotype differences associated with risk factors. Our results indicate that frontal bundles were a major age predictor, while the occipital cortex and cerebellar connections were important risk predictors that were heavily genotype dependent, and showed accelerated decline in fractional anisotropy, shape similarity, and increased asymmetry. Cognitive metrics related to olfactory memory were mapped to bundles, providing possible early markers of neurodegeneration. In addition, physiological metrics such as diastolic blood pressure were associated with changes in white matter tracts. Our novel method for a data driven analysis of sensitive changes in tractography may differentiate populations at risk for AD and isolate specific vulnerable networks.",
            "Method": "Methods\nSubjects\nAll experimental procedures have been previously reported in (Mahzarnia et al, 2023), with this paragraph serving as an updated brief overview. The procedures were approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. All participants, and where applicable study partners or caregivers, provided informed consent, and were compensated for their time at the end of the study. A total of 78 subjects were recruited, 33 males, and 45 females with a combined age range from 20 to 80 years (yrs) (median age 50.44 yrs, mean ± std: 50.4 ± 15.15 yrs). APOE genotype allelic distribution was 7 APOE2/APOE3 carriers (9% of study cohort); 35 APOE3 homozygous carriers (45%); 29 APOE3/4 carriers (37%), 7 APOE4/4 homozygous carriers (9%). Twenty-one participants (27%) had no known family history of LOAD and 57 (73%) had family relatives with LOAD.\nPhysiological, Behavioral & Cognitive Evaluation\nWe measured body, mass, height, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure as physiological parameters for subsequent analysis. Cognitive evaluation was based upon performances with the NACC UDS3 neuropsychological assessment battery. The UDS3 tests used in this study included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) screen; Craft Story to assess unstructured, auditory-verbal narrative learning and memory; the Trail Making Test, with parts A and B used to assess graphomotor and visual scanning speed, and part B assessing the complex task rule maintenance and switching under timed conditions; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – 3rd revision (WAIS-3) Digit Symbol subtest to assess information processing speed; Categorical Verbal Fluency (animals, vegetables) and Lexical Verbal Fluency (F-words, L-words), assessing speed of distributed lexical search and semantic memory and the Digit Span subtest from the WAIS-3, assessing auditory verbal attention, as well as working memory when using the backwards test. On top of the UDS3 battery of cognitive tests, we administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) for assessing structured, auditory verbal word list learning and memory \nAdditionally, we assessed olfactory sensory function, as well as short- and long-term memory for olfactory stimuli, measuring valence on aspects of odor pleasantness, intensity and familiarity. Dynamic visuo-spatial attention abilities were assessed using the computerized Useful Field of View (UFoV) Test from BrainHQ with both the presence of passive and active distractors. For statistical analysis, all subject traits, and cognitive tests metrics were converted to a z-score and combined across cognitive domains as seen in Table 1.\nImaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 3T GE Premier Performance scanner with Signa Premier version (ver. 28) with a 60 cm gradient coil with peak strength of 115 mT/m, and a 48-channel head coil. Diffusion weighted images were acquired using a robust motion-resistant, multi-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with 4 interleaved shots and reconstructed using MUSE. Parameters were set at TE 60.6 ms/TR = 14,725 ms, resolution of 1×1×1 mm isotropic, FOV at 25.6×25.6cm (256×256 matrix) and 136 slices. Overall, 21 diffusion directions (b = ⁠1000 s/mm2) and 3 non-diffusion weighted images were acquired in 24 minutes. In addition, anatomical data were acquired using a 3D T1-weighted IR-FSPGR-BRAVO sequence with TE = 3.2 ms, TR = 2263.7 ms, flip angle 8°, prep time 900 ms, recovery time 700 ms, 256 × 256 × 160 slices, 25.6 × 25 × 6 × 16 mm FOV, with image acquisition time of 5 min, 17 s.\nImage and Bundle Analysis\nAll diffusion images were preprocessed using a pipeline that included FSL-BET for brain masking, ANTs for co-registration and eddy current correction, and a Principal Component Analysis denoising process. The MRtrix toolbox was used for creating diffusion parametric maps, (e.g., fractional anisotropy, FA) which provide important estimates of microstructural tissue integrity and additionnal voxel level diffusion characteristics.\nThe MRtrix toolbox generated the streamlines of individuals using Anatomically-Constrained Tractography (ACT), in which diffusion maps were co-registered with subject-specific anatomical T1-weighted imaging data segmented into five tissue type maps (e.g., grey matter, sub-cortical grey matter, white matter, CSF and pathological tissue maps). This ACT correction method helps guarantee that generated streamline models are properly aligned with the individual brain anatomy of the subject, while also allowing anatomically truncated tracks to be re-tracked. White matter tract fiber streamline generation was carried out via a probabilistic method second-order integration of Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD) with grey matter seeding. A FOD cutoff of 0.06 was used with a step size of 0.1 mm, a minimum length of 2 mm, a maximum length of 250 mm, and a 45° limitation angle. Two million streamlines were generated per participant. The resulting streamlines were then registered into study-specific cohort average brain space using the same rigid and affine transformations applied via the ‘dipy’ package and the resulting warp transforms were applied via mrtrix3 and the tcktransform function.\nAfter ACT streamline quality control procedures, streamlines were subdivided across all participants into anatomically consistent and equivalent groupings based on pathing results. The multi-level spatial clustering approach was conducted by first downsampling streamlines downsampled into a set of 20,000 streamlines. Then, twenty individuals were randomly selected to be used as a standard template. The downsampled streamlines from all these individuals were combined into a single set, for which the right-side streamlines were flipped onto the left side of the brain to include input from both sides of the brain. From there, we formed our basic bundle centroids using dipy to form the basis of our future sets of bundles, that were made to be symmetrically equivalent for the left and right side of the brain, at first six pairs of centroids overall. The centroids were then compared to the streamlines of all subjects and used to extract the streamlines closet to the established centroids. Once this was done once initially, the process was repeated onto the already separated bundles, now establishing on every iteration three bundle descendants based on the previous set. This iterative process separates all streamlines of the brain into a set of 6, 18, 54, 162 pairs of ever smaller bundles that are equivalent across all subjects. This method allows us to divide our brain for all subjects into small sets of bundles that are 100% streamline based rather than based on previously established structures.\nFrom each bundle, we extracted multiple metrics, specifically the mean of the FA among streamlines, the standard deviation of the FA, the number of streamlines, the length of streamlines, the volume of the bundle (determined by the number of voxels traversed by the streamlines), the asymmetry, L2 norm of FA measures, as well as the BUndle ANalytics for comparing left and right side bundles in order to determine their similarity in shape in each subject (after being superposed to each other).\nOnce these statistics were extracted and summarized, the statistics for each bundle were compared to the age and genotype of subjects, using a linear model for most metrics, but using a quadratic model for average FA vs age. The bundle statistics were also compared to average cognitive measurements (see Table 1) and physiological data (Height, Weight, Systolic pressure, Diastolic pressure). The results were corrected with False Discovery rate (FDR) based on the number of bundles and the number of metrics each statistic was compared to. Our analysis process is illustrated in Figure 1."

            "Abstract": "Simple Summary\nCognitive impairment (CI) and dementia are common in patients with heart attacks, and both share common cardiovascular risk factors. In our ageing population, the management and recognition of both becomes increasingly relevant. In this review, we explore the pathophysiology behind this relationship between CI and heart attacks/heart disease. We also discuss risk factors for CI in patients with heart attacks, including the impact of age, sex, and heart failure after the heart attack. We explore how interventions for heart attacks, including percutaneous coronary angiography and bypass surgery, seem to be associated with higher rates of CI, though it is not clear whether this is related to the procedure itself or to the similar underlying risk factors. Finally, we explore how medical management, including most medications prescribed for heart attack patients, can have a positive impact on reducing the risk of CI in patients post-heart attack, though one medication (beta-blocker) may be associated with functional decline in patients with existing CI. The early identification of those with dementia or CI who present with a heart attack is important, as the subsequent tailoring of management strategies can potentially improve outcomes as well as guide prognosis.\nAbstract\nCognitive impairment (CI) shares common cardiovascular risk factors with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is increasingly prevalent in our ageing population. Whilst AMI is associated with increased rates of CI, CI remains underreported and infrequently identified in patients with AMI. In this review, we discuss the evidence surrounding AMI and its links to dementia and CI, including pathophysiology, risk factors, management and interventions. Vascular dysregulation plays a major role in CI, with atherosclerosis, platelet activation, microinfarcts and perivascular inflammation resulting in neurovascular unit dysfunction, disordered homeostasis and a dysfunctional neurohormonal response. This subsequently affects perfusion pressure, resulting in enlarged periventricular spaces and hippocampal sclerosis. The increased platelet activation seen in coronary artery disease (CAD) can also result in inflammation and amyloid-β protein deposition which is associated with Alzheimer’s Dementia. Post-AMI, reduced blood pressure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction can cause chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, cerebral infarction and failure of normal circulatory autoregulatory mechanisms. Patients who undergo coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or bypass surgery) are at increased risk for post-procedure cognitive impairment, though whether this is related to the intervention itself or underlying cardiovascular risk factors is debated. Mortality rates are higher in dementia patients with AMI, and post-AMI CI is more prevalent in the elderly and in patients with post-AMI heart failure. Medical management (antiplatelet, statin, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, cardiac rehabilitation) can reduce the risk of post-AMI CI; however, beta-blockers may be associated with functional decline in patients with existing CI. The early identification of those with dementia or CI who present with AMI is important, as subsequent tailoring of management strategies can potentially improve outcomes as well as guide prognosis.",

        "summary": {
            "Abstract": "Among candidate neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric risk-predictive biomarkers, platelet count, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width have been associated with the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) through epidemiological and genomic studies, suggesting partial co-heritability. We exploited these relationships for a multi-trait association analysis, using publicly available summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of all traits reported above. Gene-based enrichment tests were carried out, as well as a network analysis of significantly enriched genes. We analyzed 4,540,326 single nucleotide polymorphisms shared among the analyzed GWASs, observing 149 genome-wide significant multi-trait LD-independent associations (p < 5 × 10−8) for AD, 70 for PD and 139 for MDD. Among these, 27 novel associations were detected for AD, 34 for PD and 40 for MDD. Out of 18,781 genes with annotated variants within ±10 kb, 62 genes were enriched for associations with AD, 70 with PD and 125 with MDD (p < 2.7 × 10−6). Of these, seven genes were novel susceptibility loci for AD (EPPK1, TTLL1, PACSIN2, TPM4, PIF1, ZNF689, AZGP1P1), two for PD (SLC26A1, EFNA3) and two for MDD (HSPH1, TRMT61A). The resulting network showed a significant excess of interactions (enrichment p = 1.0 × 10−16). The novel genes that were identified are involved in the organization of cytoskeletal architecture (EPPK1, TTLL1, PACSIN2, TPM4), telomere shortening (PIF1), the regulation of cellular aging (ZNF689, AZGP1P1) and neurodevelopment (EFNA3), thus, providing novel insights into the shared underlying biology of brain disorders and platelet parameters.",
            "Method": "2. Materials and Methods\nWe used MTAG to perform a multi-trait association analysis of three neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative disorders-AD, PD and MDD-and three common platelet parameters that have been associated with their risk, namely, Plt, MPV and PDW. MTAG is a generalization of standard, inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis between two or more genetically correlated traits, which generates trait-specific associations for each genetic variant shared among the source GWAS studies, using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to account for potential sample overlap. The summary statistics of AD (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls and 13,309,438 SNPs), PD (37,688 cases, 18,618 UK Biobank proxy-cases, 1,417,791 controls and 10,081,487 SNPs), MDD (246,363 cases, 561,190 controls and 7,880,531 SNPs), Plt (38,561,936 SNPs), MPV (41,254,093 SNPs) and PDW (41,253,708 SNPs; all with N = 408,112 participants of European ancestry) were obtained from published GWAS summary statistics data (see URLs). To carry out MTAG analysis, we first pre-processed and quality-controlled summary statistics from each study involved: SNP (rs) ids were retrieved, and Z-score was computed by log (OR)/SE when these were not available; MAF threshold was set at 0.01; indels were removed and SNPs mapping to the same position of other variants and/or showing conflicting alleles among different studies were dropped. After variant filtering, the number of variants left for analysis was 8,632,257 for AD; 6,582,074 for PD; 7,183,400 for MDD; 8,933,201 for Plt; 8,933,763 for MPV; and 8,934,170 for PDW. Of these, 4,540,326 variants were in common among the different studies and, therefore, underwent MTAG analysis. Using Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) platform, we first identified LD-independent genome-wide significant SNPs within each study (p < 5.0 × 10−8; pairwise r2 < 0.6 in a 1 Mb window). Then, we selected novel genome-wide significant SNP associations with the analyzed disorders, defined as associations not detected as genome-wide significant in the original study, nor in previous GWASs of the same disorder, based on the GWAS catalog and literature search until 30 April 2022 (Table 1).\nTo have further biological insights into the underlying biology of common variance in different neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative disorders and platelet parameters, associations underwent gene, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis through MAGMA v1.08, within the FUMA platform. This was carried out for all the protein-coding genes to which at least one SNP was annotated within a ±10 kb interval, namely, 18,781 genes. A Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied accordingly, based on the number of genes tested (α = 2.7 × 10−6) (Table 2).\nTo estimate protein–protein interactions (PPIs) among the genes enriched for associations, we used the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins in db-STRING v11.5. We analyzed genes significantly enriched for associations with AD, PD and MDD, first separately and then merged into a single list, to compute “global” interactions among all the genes significantly enriched for any of the three disorders. The obtained network included both direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations, specifically evidence of interaction from curated databases; evidence experimentally determined; gene neighborhood; gene fusions; gene co-occurrence; joint gene mentioning based on text mining in published articles; gene co-expression; and protein homology. We set a minimum interaction score of >0.7 so that only high-confidence interactions between proteins were included in the analysis. The observed excess of interactions compared to the expected number of edges among nodes, average node degree (i.e., the average number of edges per node in the graph) and local clustering coefficient (i.e., a measure of the extent to which nodes in the graph tend to cluster together) were taken as measures of network density and clustering levels."

Models generally satisfied metrics of fairness with respect to sex.\nMeaning\nThis study found that machine learning models had notable deficits in fairness across race and ethnicity groups.\nImportance\nPredictive models using machine learning techniques have potential to improve early detection and management of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, these models potentially have biases and may perpetuate or exacerbate existing disparities.\nObjective\nTo characterize the algorithmic fairness of longitudinal prediction models for AD progression.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis prognostic study investigated the algorithmic fairness of logistic regression, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks for predicting progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using data from participants in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative evaluated at 57 sites in the US and Canada. Participants aged 54 to 91 years who contributed data on at least 2 visits between September 2005 and May 2017 were included. Data were analyzed in October 2022.\nExposures\nFairness was quantified across sex, ethnicity, and race groups. Neuropsychological test scores, anatomical features from T1 magnetic resonance imaging, measures extracted from positron emission tomography, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were included as predictors.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nOutcome measures quantified fairness of prediction models (logistic regression [LR], support vector machine [SVM], and recurrent neural network [RNN] models), including equal opportunity, equalized odds, and demographic parity. Specifically, if the model exhibited equal sensitivity for all groups, it aligned with the principle of equal opportunity, indicating fairness in predictive performance.\nResults\nA total of 1730 participants in the cohort (mean [SD] age, 73.81 [6.92] years; 776 females [44.9%]; 69 Hispanic [4.0%] and 1661 non-Hispanic [96.0%]; 29 Asian [1.7%], 77 Black [4.5%], 1599 White [92.4%], and 25 other race [1.4%]) were included. Sensitivity for predicting progression to MCI and AD was lower for Hispanic participants compared with non-Hispanic participants; the difference (SD) in true positive rate ranged from 20.9% (5.5%) for the RNN model to 27.8% (9.8%) for the SVM model in MCI and 24.1% (5.4%) for the RNN model to 48.2% (17.3%) for the LR model in AD. Sensitivity was similarly lower for Black and Asian participants compared with non-Hispanic White participants; for example, the difference (SD) in AD true positive rate was 14.5% (51.6%) in the LR model, 12.3% (35.1%) in the SVM model, and 28.4% (16.8%) in the RNN model for Black vs White participants, and the difference (SD) in MCI true positive rate was 25.6% (13.1%) in the LR model, 24.3% (13.1%) in the SVM model, and 6.8% (18.7%) in the RNN model for Asian vs White participants. Models generally satisfied metrics of fairness with respect to sex, with no significant differences by group, except for cognitively normal (CN)–MCI and MCI-AD transitions (eg, an absolute increase [SD] in the true positive rate of CN-MCI transitions of 10.3% [27.8%] for the LR model).\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this study, models were accurate in aggregate but failed to satisfy fairness metrics. These findings suggest that fairness should be considered in the development and use of machine learning models for AD progression.",
            "Method": "Methods\nThis prognostic study followed the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) reporting guideline. Written informed consent was obtained for participation in ADNI, as approved by the institutional review board at each participating center. Ethical approval and informed consent were not required because this study, consisting of secondary data analysis of coded data that cannot be linked to individual participants, is not considered human participants research according to the policies of the Institutional Review Board of the University Pennsylvania.\nPopulation\nData were derived from the ADNI to facilitate study of AD progression. In brief, ADNI enrolled participants aged 54 to 91 years at 57 sites in the US and Canada. Our data set incorporated longitudinal data from multiple ADNI study phases and measurements from every participant contributing data on at least 2 visits between September 2005 and May 2017. Clinical status at each visit was classified as cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD.\nProtected Attributes\nTo evaluate fairness criteria, groups were defined by demographic attributes. We focused on attributes of sex, ethnicity, and race because previous studies in the fairness literature have highlighted algorithmic bias according to these characteristics. All characteristics were classified according to participant self-report. Sex was classified as female or male. Ethnicity was classified as not Hispanic or Latino or Hispanic or Latino. Participants reporting unknown ethnicity were excluded from ethnicity-stratified analyses. Race included 7 distinct groups: Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black or African American, Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, and more than 1 reported race. We aggregated America Indian and Alaskan Native, Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, more than 1 race, and unknown into a category labeled other due to their small population sizes and evaluated fairness across 4 racial categories: Asian, Black, White, and other.\nStudy Design\nWe defined unfairness, or algorithmic bias, as differences in the predictive performance of an ML algorithm across subpopulations defined by a protected attribute. For example, differences in sensitivity of a model for predicting AD progression in a Black population compared with a White population would be indicative of unfairness. We focused on 3 commonly used fairness metrics: equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity. These criteria have natural interpretations in the context of AD progression prediction. Equal opportunity is defined as equal sensitivity or true positive rates (TPRs) of the ML algorithm across all levels of the protected attribute. An AD progression algorithm would exhibit equal opportunity if individuals who progressed to AD were equally likely to be identified by the algorithm across all protected groups. Equalized odds requires that an algorithm exhibit equal opportunity and equal specificity or false positive rates (FPRs) across groups. Demographic parity is the equivalence of a predicted event’s probability across groups by sensitive attribute. For progression to AD, demographic parity with respect to sex would be satisfied if females and males were predicted to develop AD with equal probability. When real differences in outcome prevalence exist across groups, achieving demographic parity may be undesirable. Importantly, unless prevalence is equal across groups, it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy all metrics. Table 1 presents mathematical definitions of these fairness metrics.\nPrediction Models\nWe assessed fairness with respect to the task of predicting AD progression with ML algorithms. We selected 3 ML models for evaluation in this study: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and recurrent neural network (RNN) models. We included LR and SVM because they are well-established ML models commonly used for prediction problems and are often presented as comparators for new models. As a deep-learning model, RNN has shown promise in the AD progression domain and has been applied to prediction problems, demonstrating improvement over other ML models on prediction accuracy. The RNN model we tested in this study is from Nguyen et al. Given multimodal predictors and the diagnostic status of a participant at baseline, we sought to predict diagnosis stage at the subsequent visit as CN, MCI, or AD for all subsequent months. We defined progression trajectories as transition from baseline CN to MCI, baseline MCI to AD, stable CN, and stable MCI (ie, patients recorded at the same stage at baseline and at a final visit). Predictors included neuropsychological test scores, anatomical features derived from magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography measures, and cerebrospinal fluid markers (see complete list of predictors in Table 2). Additional details of model implementation and training are provided in eMethods in Supplement 1.\nWe used cross-validation for model selection and evaluation. Data were randomly partitioned into 10 equal subsets. Each 10-fold cross-validation iteration used 80% of participants for training, 10% of participants for model validation, and 10% of participants for testing. The training set was used for model fitting, the validation set for hyperparameter selection, and the test set for model performance evaluation. All continuous variables were z normalized using the training set to estimate the mean and SD, which were then used to z normalize validation and test sets. The multiclass area under the operating curve and balanced class accuracy were used to evaluate models (eMethods and eTable 2 in Supplement 1).\nStatistical Analysis\nTo assess algorithmic fairness, we calculated fairness metrics on each of 10 test sets using predictions from each model. Metrics are reported as the mean and SD across the 10 values. Evaluations were conducted separately by demographic group. We first assessed equal opportunity by computing the TPR for groups defined by each protected attribute separately for each cognitive functioning trajectory (ie, CN to MCI, MCI to AD, stable CN, and stable MCI) and each of 3 models. The TPR quantifies the proportion of individuals experiencing a given trajectory who were correctly predicted to follow that trajectory. For instance, the TPR of CN to MCI represents the probability of correctly predicting that an individual progressed from CN to MCI. A TPR value of 1 indicates that the model has achieved perfect sensitivity in identifying the positive instances within the category. If the TPRs for each trajectory are similar across protected feature categories, it suggests that the model attained equal opportunity. We also calculated differences in TPR between groups for each protected attribute. In addition to TPR, we calculated the FPR. Specifically, for a given trajectory the FPR is defined as the proportion of individuals who did not experience that trajectory who were incorrectly predicted to follow that trajectory. For example, the FPR of CN to MCI represents the probability of predicting progression from CN to MCI for an individual who did not progress. An algorithm must demonstrate equal TPR and equal FPR across groups to satisfy the equalized odds criterion. To assess demographic parity, we computed the predicted probability for each individual. We report the difference in mean predicted probabilities across groups for each sensitive attribute, trajectory, and ML model. Finally, we calculated the empirical probability of each trajectory stratified by demographic group. Hypothesis testing was not used in this context due to the lack of independence among predicted values on test sets. Additionally, due to small sample sizes in some groups, nonparametric and parametric tests are expected to have low power. We therefore focused on point estimation and interpretation of point estimates given their variability. An overview of the experimental procedure is shown in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1. Statical analysis was conducted using Python programming language version 2.7 (Python Software Foundation). Data were analyzed in October 2022."
