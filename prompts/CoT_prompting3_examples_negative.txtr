{'Abstract': 'INTRODUCTION:\nSleep deprivation increases CSF Aβ and tau levels, however sleep’s effect on Aβ and tau in plasma is unknown.\nMETHODS:\nIn a cross-over design, CSF Aβ and tau concentrations were measured in five cognitively normal individuals had blood and CSF collected every two hours for thirty-six hours during sleep-deprived and normal sleep control conditions.\nRESULTS:\nAβ40, Aβ42, unphosphorylated tau-threonine-181 (T181), unphosphorylated tau-threonine-217 (T217), and phosphorylated T181 (pT181) concentrations increased ~35–55% in CSF and decreased ~5–15% in plasma during sleep deprivation. CSF/plasma ratios of all AD biomarkers increased during sleep deprivation while the CSF/plasma albumin ratio, a measure of blood-CSF barrier permeability, decreased. CSF and plasma Aβ42/40, pT181/T181, and pT181/Aβ42 ratios were stable longitudinally in both groups.\nDISCUSSION:\nThese findings show that sleep loss alters some plasma AD biomarkers by lowering brain clearance mechanisms and needs to be taken into account when interpreting individual plasma AD biomarkers but not ratios.', 'Method': 'METHODS\nParticipants and Sample Collection\nFive cognitively normal amyloid-negative participants aged 30–60 underwent both sleep-deprived and normal sleep conditions in a cross-over design study. As previously reported, all participants reported no clinical sleep disorders or subjective daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scores [1 participant did not complete): mean=3.75, standard deviation (SD)=2.99, range=1–8) and were screened to exclude sleep-disordered breathing with a home sleep apnea test (all with Respiratory Event Index <5). Participants were either assigned normal control or sleep-deprived conditions, and then returned ~4–6 months later on average for cross-over to the other condition. Three participants completed the control condition followed by sleep deprivation, and two participants completed sleep deprivation followed by control. Participant characteristics are listed in Table 1. The effect of sleep deprivation in these participants on CSF Aβ, tau, and p-tau were previously reported. The study protocol was approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board and an independent safety committee oversaw the entire study with regular review of adverse events and approval to continue. All participants completed written informed consent and were compensated for their participation in the study.\nVenous and lumbar catheters were placed at ~7:00 a.m. on the first day. CSF and plasma were obtained every 2 hours for 36 hours. All CSF samples were collected and processed as previously described. Blood was drawn into EDTA K2 containing Tube (BD 368589). The tubes were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Then, plasma samples were aliquoted with 1 ml volumes and frozen by dry ice and later stored at −80 °C.\nMeasurement of CSF and Plasma Aβ and Tau\nCSF Aβ and tau were measured by immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) as previously described. We conducted the plasma Aβ IP LC/MS as reported except all handling processes were performed by Hamilton Microlab STAR Liquid Handling System (Hamilton, NV, U.S.A) in an automated processing method. Human plasma tau separation was performed as previously described with modifications. Frozen plasma aliquots of 1 ml were thawed at room temperature and centrifuged at 21,130 g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Plasma samples were spiked with 2.5 ng of 15N-labeled recombinant 2N4R tau internal standard (gift from Guy Lippens, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite de Lille, Villeneuve-d’Ascq, France) with a mixture of 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1% NP-40, and 5 mM guanidine and then immunoprecipitated with 20 μl Tau1 antibody cross-linked to sepharose beads at 4°C overnight. The pelleted sepharose beads were washed with 25 mM TEABC and then the sample was extracted with 200 μL 0.1% TFA. The extracted samples were loaded on an Oasis HLB 96-well μElution plate 30 μm, 2 mg Sorbent per well (Waters) conditioned with 200 μl MeOH and 200 μl 0.1% TFA. After loading, samples were desalted with 200 μl 0.1% TFA and then eluted with 100 μl 27.5% acetonitrile-0.1% TFA solution. After drying, absolute quantitation peptides (Life Technologies) to 5 and 0.5 fmol for each unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptide were added to the samples for quantitation and then digested with 400 ng trypsin in 25mM TEABC for 16 hours. Finally, samples were purified by solid phase extraction on C18 TopTips (Glygen) and desalted and eluted with 100 μl 60% ACN, 0.1% FA. The eluate was lyophilized and resuspended in 12.5 μl 2% ACN, 0.1% FA before nano-LC-MS/high-resolution MS analysis by using nanoAcquity ultra performance LC system (Waters) coupled to an Orbitrap Tribrid Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating as reported. Skyline software (MacCoss Lab, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) was used to extract the LC-MS data.\nMeasurement of CSF/Plasma Albumin Ratio\nCSF albumin and plasma albumin were quantified by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the kit instructions. CSF and plasma from all time points of each participant were run in duplicate on the same ELISA plate.\nStatistics Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 28 (IBM, Armonk, NY). All serial CSF and plasma Aβ and tau data were analyzed with general linear mixed models in order to account for the dependences of the longitudinal measurements. Comparisons were made between conditions with individual within-participant data and not group averaged data. Intervention group and time of day were treated as fixed effects. Random intercepts and slopes for time were used to accommodate individual variation. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to compare covariance structures and compound symmetry was selected as the best fit. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The normality assumption was verified through residual plots.'}
