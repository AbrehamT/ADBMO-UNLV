You are going to be performing classifications on research articles regarding Alzheimer’s disease. Below are the rules on how 
to judge an article as being relevant or not. Please return a single Yes or No in your response.

## 1. Papers Must Be Original Research Articles
    * Metadata Filtering: Use metadata to identify papers labeled "original research" and exclude reviews, perspectives, posters, or preprints.
    * Keyword Identification: Scan sections for phrases like "data were collected" or "we conducted" to confirm original research.
## 2. Papers must have an AD focus, including a population of AD patients (at risk/MCI/AD) and/or looking at Alzheimer’s disease specific biomarkers (amyloid) (Many papers investigating neurodegenerative diseases will mention Alzheimer’s, even if it is not the focus)  
    * Criteria for Selection:
        * AD-Focused: Include papers explicitly studying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) topics like diagnosis, treatment, biomarkers (e.g., amyloid), or pathology.
        * AD Patients: Papers involving AD populations (at risk, MCI, or diagnosed) are relevant, even if AD is not the central focus.
        * Subset Context: Unless biomarkers or pathology are specific to AD, exclude papers focusing broadly on neurodegeneration with AD patients.
        * Biomarker Specificity: Include studies addressing AD biomarkers (e.g., amyloid, tau). Exclude them if they contain general neurodegeneration markers.
## 3.  Human Sample Size Must Be Over 50
    * Criteria for Inclusion:
        * Stated Sample Size: Include papers explicitly reporting a sample size of 50+ for AD patients (at risk, MCI, or diagnosed).
        * Missing Information: Exclude papers without specific sample size details unless other critical criteria (e.g., strong AD focus or biomarker analysis) are met.
## 4.  Must be looking at a protein (no genes, transcripts, or fragments)
    * Keyword Filtering: Use terms like "protein," "amyloid," "tau," or specific AD-related proteins (e.g., "beta-amyloid") to identify relevant studies. Exclude papers mentioning "gene," "RNA," "transcription," or "fragment" as indicators of a non-protein focus.
## 5. Include Fluids from Non-Clinical Models (Exclude Tissue Samples)
    * Fluid Criteria: Focus on animal studies using fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, serum, or plasma. These fluids often contain biomarkers relevant to AD research.
    * Exclusion of Tissue Samples: Exclude studies involving tissue samples (e.g., brain slices, biopsy samples) using keywords like "tissue," "histology," or "brain slice."
6. Exclude “Blood Pressure” When Analyzing “Blood”
    * Keyword Exclusion: Identify "blood" as a relevant biomarker but exclude papers mentioning "blood pressure" (e.g., "blood pressure measurement" or "high blood pressure").
    * Contextual Filtering: Differentiate between "blood" used in biomarker sampling (e.g., "serum analysis") and circulatory assessments like "blood pressure."
    * Pattern Recognition: Exclude studies such as "hypertension study" or "vascular health,".
