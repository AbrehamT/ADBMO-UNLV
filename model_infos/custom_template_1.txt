You are going to be performing classifications on research articles regarding Alzheimer’s disease. Below are the guidelines on how 
to judge an article as being relevant or not. Please return a single Yes or No in your response.

## 1. Papers Must Be Original Research Articles
    * Metadata Filtering: Use metadata to identify papers labeled "original research" and exclude reviews, perspectives, posters, or preprints.
    * Keyword Identification: Scan sections for phrases like "data were collected" or "we conducted" to confirm original research. Flag terms like "this review explores" or "we summarize" for exclusion.
    * Preprint/Poster Exclusion: Exclude papers from platforms like "arXiv," "bioRxiv," or those labeled "poster presented."
    * Automated Categorization: Use metadata and text analysis to classify papers. Only include those strongly aligned with "original research."
## 2. Papers must have an AD focus, including a population of AD patients (at risk/MCI/AD) and/or looking at Alzheimer’s disease specific biomarkers (amyloid) (Many papers investigating neurodegenerative diseases will mention Alzheimer’s, even if it is not the focus)  
    * Criteria for Selection:
        * AD-Focused: Include papers explicitly studying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) topics like diagnosis, treatment, biomarkers (e.g., amyloid), or pathology.
        * AD Patients: Papers involving AD populations (at risk, MCI, or diagnosed) are relevant, even if AD is not the central focus.
        * Subset Context: Categorize papers focusing broadly on neurodegeneration with AD patients as "AD-relevant," unless biomarkers or pathology are specific to AD.
        * Biomarker Specificity: Prioritize studies addressing AD biomarkers (e.g., amyloid, tau) over general neurodegeneration markers.
    * LLM Utilization:
        * Identify keywords like "Alzheimer’s," "amyloid," or "neurodegeneration."
        * Differentiate papers as "AD-focused" or "AD-relevant" based on biomarker and patient population content.
        * This ensures inclusion of research directly tied to AD while recognizing broader studies with AD relevance.
## 3.  Human Sample Size Must Be Over 50
    * Criteria for Inclusion:
        * Stated Sample Size: Include papers explicitly reporting a sample size of 50+ for AD patients (at risk, MCI, or diagnosed).
        * Missing Information: Exclude papers without specific sample size details unless other critical criteria (e.g., strong AD focus or biomarker analysis) are met.
        * LLM Filtering: Use the LLM to identify terms like "n =", "sample size," or "number of participants." Flag unclear cases for secondary review if warranted.
        * This ensures the inclusion of robust studies with sufficient participant data while focusing on transparent methodologies.
## 4.  Must be looking at a protein (no genes, transcripts, or fragments)
    * Training Dataset: Compile papers clearly categorized as either protein-focused or gene/transcript-focused. This will provide the LLM with concrete examples to distinguish between the two categories, even without an exhaustive list of proteins.
    * Keyword Filtering: Use terms like "protein," "amyloid," "tau," or specific AD-related proteins (e.g., "beta-amyloid") to identify relevant studies. Exclude papers mentioning "gene," "RNA," "transcription," or "fragment" as indicators of a non-protein focus.
    * Contextual Pattern Recognition: Train the LLM to go beyond keywords and recognize context-specific usage, such as identifying molecular mechanisms tied to proteins versus genetic or transcriptomic functions.
    * Iterative Refinement: Review the LLM's classifications periodically. Add misclassified papers as additional examples to improve its ability to recognize complex distinctions, like protein interactions or separating fragments from full proteins.
    * Manual Review for Ambiguities: Flag papers with ambiguous terms (e.g., "molecular markers") for manual checks. Continued refinement of the LLM will reduce reliance on manual reviews over time.
    * This expanded approach ensures accurate identification of protein-specific studies while maintaining flexibility for edge cases.
## 5. Include Fluids from Non-Clinical Models (Exclude Tissue Samples)
    * Fluid Criteria: Focus on animal studies using fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, serum, or plasma. These fluids often contain biomarkers relevant to AD research.
    * Exclusion of Tissue Samples: Exclude studies involving tissue samples (e.g., brain slices, biopsy samples) using keywords like "tissue," "histology," or "brain slice."
    * Sample Paper Review: Provide example papers to train the LLM on acceptable fluid-based studies versus tissue-based ones, using phrases like “CSF collection” or “serum analysis.”
    * Iterative Refinement: Regularly review and refine the LLM’s ability to distinguish cases where both fluids and tissues are mentioned, ensuring focus remains on fluid-based biomarkers.
    * LLM Training: Build context-based learning to differentiate between fluid-borne biomarkers and structural tissue analyses.
6. Exclude “Blood Pressure” When Analyzing “Blood”
    * Keyword Exclusion: Identify "blood" as relevant but exclude papers mentioning "blood pressure" (e.g., "blood pressure measurement" or "high blood pressure").
    * Contextual Filtering: Train the LLM to differentiate between "blood" used in biomarker sampling (e.g., "serum analysis") and circulatory assessments like "blood pressure."
    * Pattern Recognition: Address indirect references, such as "hypertension study" or "vascular health," by training the LLM with examples of these patterns for exclusion.
    * Confidence Scoring: Assign confidence levels for "blood" contexts. Automatically exclude high-confidence blood pressure-related papers and flag ambiguous cases for manual review.
    * This ensures focus on biomarker-related studies while excluding those centered on blood pressure or circulatory metrics.
